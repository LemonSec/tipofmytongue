1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,800
If anyone's ever seen me speak before,

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,540
we should have a round of applauds for the projector,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,300
because this always goes horribly wrong.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,900
so... woohoo!

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,899
[applauds]

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,340
So, guys..

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,140
It's always a great honor to be a keynote

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,620
so, before I start there's the traditional thing

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,860
good to give a round of applauds to

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,960
the organizers of Security Fest

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,520
they're the reason we're all here!

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,600
[applauds]

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm gonna do a talk

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,560
once my microphone untangles from my hair..

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,240
I'm sure being in Sweden, that's something you all can appreciate

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,740
I'm going to do a talk called Proto - Swedish - Hipsters

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,760
because... I'll explain all this in a second

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,680
This is really a story, about the other

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,920
Security Fest... uh... Sec-T!

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,330
so huh just to do something for me I
tend to be quite interactive with

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:19,090
audiences so can you all do me a favor, put your
hands up.. all of you come on don't be shy

22
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,780
okay keep your hands up have you been to
security uh.. if you've been to Sec-T

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,340
keep your hands up if you've been to Sec-T
right you guys have a pretty good idea

24
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,729
was coming right everyone else... I'm really
sorry!  so this story starts about three

25
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:40,660
years ago and I did a talk at Security Fest
uh.... I'm gonna do this whole day!

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,429
well I was at Sec-T
the talk at Sec-T was The Wrong Side of History

27
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:53,840
a basically loots and spooks and it was
talking about the problems of modern-day

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,690
cryptographers versus the problems in
1950s theoretical physicists they used

29
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:10,818
the Manhattan Project to talk about and
that's when I met these guys.. Worst karaoke night ever!

30
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:19,250
It was kinda cool. He was a great singer and then the year after, Sec-T asked me to come back and do

31
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,050
the second part of the keynote which was
State-Surveillance and it was about

32
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,670
State Surveillance during the European Reformation
so about during the fifteen hundreds and

33
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,859
how the states surveiled their citizens and so
on and so forth you know because I

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,000
wanted to highlight that these problems
are not new problems they are historical

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,410
problems that keep on turning up
and then to the final part

36
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,950
they asked me to come back and do the
evolution of privacy I'm not sure if

37
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:52,069
you've noticed but I like to talk with my hands
seems to be the big thing so if you

38
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,560
missed it, they made me do three keynotes

39
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:04,550
over three years about history at a security
conference which is cool

40
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,780
Johan contacted me, and asked me if I would come to speak to you guys and I said cool I could do

41
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:20,150
Some data hacking stuff, I can do this, Ican do this. Or I can talk a
little bit about history...

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,980
if anyone was at sec-t you notice that I said to
everyone at sec-t last year.. I'm not doing

43
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:31,298
another history talk because I'm gonna
get typecast as a historian... thanks guys!

44
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,170
so I started my research.. so this is a
little bit different because firstly

45
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,950
when I do these things normally I
actually have an idea before someone

46
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,420
says do the history thing! normally, it's like let's talk about privacy well let's talk

47
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,649
about state surveillance let's talk about
this and this time it's like hey do

48
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:56,840
something about sweden, it will be awesome so I
started the research these are not easy

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:08,239
to research - roasted imagination and I
thought guys Tacitus untasted this is a

50
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,970
robbery story quite famous did the
really the first a little work on what

51
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,529
Germany it was our bet - I was talking
about Amarna a minute back and he won't

52
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:31,520
this basically this book 400 or BC
Christmas about really should have been

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:40,030
cool fun facts about Germany there is no
that's work long by tassels the guy

54
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:47,590
wrote an entire book to troll an entire
continent it was fuckin awesome and this

55
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:54,609
is what we were left with the idea Jomon
which is basically everything that isn't

56
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,960
wrong who
so he talks a little bit about Augustus

57
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,060
Caesar it talks a little bit about
Armenians I'll talk about these guys a

58
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:16,440
little bit but our story starts ways
with a guy called Julius Caesar he's

59
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,670
quite famous do you think this is small
part of that thing's Julius would be

60
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,200
very hot we was talking about him a
security conference 2,000 years after

61
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:33,039
his existence right yeah so he's
plaintiff famous who's a bit of a bridge

62
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,930
builder and he built a bridge what kind
of made him huge is he built the bridge

63
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,880
across the Rhine a wooden bridge across
the Rhine before hundred Germanic tribes

64
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,909
like haha you can't get us because this
big crying river in front of us we are

65
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,300
singing and do this when hahaha bridge

66
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:05,230
and well this huge wooden bridge and
marched 40,000 Romans into the ride

67
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:11,260
across the Rhine from a wooden bridge
I can imagine if you were a German price

68
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:25,000
person you probably thought yeah best
project manager ever to can take days to

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,370
achieve this feat can you imagine being
on the other side these guys doing in

70
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:37,030
the Spurs why why they couldn't reach
that thrown into the water I mean I

71
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:44,020
guess it could call them in advance
persistent rolling mr. Julius marching

72
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:51,940
entered upon Ian who and this is really
a pivotal moment this was the beginning

73
00:06:51,940 --> 00:07:01,870
of what we know today as Judas seasonal
victorious actually crossing into things

74
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:09,370
that was kind of easy for version he
later on went to conquer all because

75
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:15,430
it's a lot easier to conquer all that it
is to stand trial and basically what

76
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,200
happened is he had a number of issues
back at home and of course it's always

77
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,150
better to stay out fighting than it is
to go back on so he decided to conquer

78
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,679
goal and probably is he hit a little bit
too fast and he was left on the

79
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,980
wonderful thing
conquer Britain do a great job now this

80
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,510
is also picture because you know me
fucked up when you talk to a spirit by

81
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:52,980
holding above low and this is this is
huge this is absolutely huge the Roman

82
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,190
Empire
well the Roman Republic at this point is

83
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:04,560
known in Tampa is a Democratic Society
and it so far - this is covered all of

84
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,700
the all of these difficulties that see
in some way in stable form but when he's

85
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,909
probably incredibly famous for is
crossing the Rubicon and if we imagine

86
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,910
how it was this is a term that we used
today and the Rubicon is a river that

87
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:29,510
runs by basically separators they like

88
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:36,740
gentlemen and their legions before
crossing the Rubicon that's basically

89
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:44,900
good and basically what happens here is
Judas has these leaders that lover love

90
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:53,970
lucky more important than lavake general
so he decides that he isn't gonna go

91
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,470
it's not trial fucking roll with the
Senate in fact he's gonna go and get rid

92
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:05,970
aside and he decides to cross the
Rubicon and this is basically against it

93
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:12,780
against which funny enough started the
Civil War we've seen this covered mrs.

94
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,910
quite famous Civil War to do he ends up
winning and becomes dictator to life

95
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,420
it's sort of like with the Magdalen
dictator for life but with a lot less

96
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,199
power and he takes control and dictator
is not a bad term at this point in

97
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,450
history system we do later and he does
something there's a friendly unusual

98
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,260
he forgives so all of those that fought
against in the Civil War he forgives

99
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,920
which is highly unusual and kind of
awkward for the people on the other end

100
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,819
because it's implied that you owe him
for not killing you so he didn't make a

101
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,580
lot of friends he did a lot of things he
brought there that he brought from from

102
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:08,840
an emergency dictatorship into a
long-standing and his idea of the idea

103
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,610
of being a dictator was only for a short
term you know much like martial arts are

104
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:21,050
nowadays wanna it's been simple but you
know at the end of the day I'm supposed

105
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,689
to be a dictator for two years seven
years later they realize that maybe he's

106
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,610
not dying anymore they look a bit
worried because I started to see himself

107
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:41,480
as God the dictator and probably at this
point what he was really famous for was

108
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,430
defining the new enemy that is the
Germanic tribes he did this bearing in

109
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,689
mind this is the guy who built bridge
and then scared the shit out of everyone

110
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,670
and everyone ran and then about eight
years later things I push it the Germans

111
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,740
oh my god they're dangerous we need to
build a wall we need to conquer them we

112
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:08,570
need to do all of the stuff and then the
height of his power he was murdered

113
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,060
assassinated and probably one of the
most famous assassinations in history we

114
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,489
all know the story that's I think you
probably like this too and this is all

115
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:26,130
the Senators clothes for it is quite
violent of Bruce's his own

116
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,150
Mercy's a doctor's son staggered into
genitalia

117
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:36,990
so give you a rough idea cut why that
actually was I'm not quite sure what he

118
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,650
might have done to cause that apart from
say hey why didn't you inherit the whole

119
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,949
drug when I died
take this sword into your family jewels

120
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:56,670
when he won't do his work right so this
the census thought that this would be a

121
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:03,449
way for them to get democracy back to
what they were cycle this caused a

122
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,830
nother severe quite Affairs Longclaw
announcer and eventually obtaining his

123
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:22,620
heir becomes becomes heir and starts a
whole new process and these two seasons

124
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,900
are very easy to remember the story
right July they are going to get names

125
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,510
those monsters
so just remember July August so I

126
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:44,490
digress a little bit so that falls back
to gold Jemaine so this is the face of

127
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:51,720
someone that's like homage owners and he
discusses probably what is one of the

128
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,700
best in the cyber threat stories that
you've ever heard in your life

129
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:05,310
right this is amazing
so this is our means and if you know you

130
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:11,979
dope history
this is Herman as well and Arminius

131
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,800
cause there's a controversy in Germany
don't get me wrong

132
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,040
the change is running forever the army
exposes the Roman Empire so Arminius is

133
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,079
a Sun Rover chieftain and the Germanic
we accomplished a Mack truck and half

134
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:32,089
the deal when you make a deal with
Ronald is there different hostages right

135
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:40,490
so what the Roman would do is they would
take the son of the chieftain or the son

136
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:46,009
of the brother of the chieftain or
whatever they were taken to Rome and

137
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:51,589
teach them to be wrong and the only
people lightness is twofold firstly that

138
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:57,829
they would the Chieftains would be less
likely to report if their family sit in

139
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:03,739
the waiting room and secondly you know
the st. John who were promised Lincoln

140
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,019
generations well the idea was is that if
you teach the Chieftains son to be wrong

141
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:16,160
give him heated floors baths the best
education so on and so forth

142
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,319
and when you go back you'll have a
puppet Roman in charge of the Germanic

143
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:27,259
tribes later on so Arminius was a
wonderful run run run Falls downs with

144
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:32,779
usually a fully embraced the life was a
wonderful day they gave him a job in the

145
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:39,759
military he worked his way up in the
German auxiliaries and was quite tired

146
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:47,319
eventually they come to a place called
Schreiber forest this is fear to a-rod

147
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:54,079
because ron has deforested his own
country many many generations before us

148
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,929
and this idea that they're going to
start fighting invisible people who were

149
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:05,300
not quite cultured running around misty
forests where demons and spirits live

150
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:12,019
it's not so cool so this story is
involved Armenians Cuba forest Roman

151
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,720
legions while the but three growing
needs

152
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,000
by three Roman legions three Roman
legions a cover of auxiliaries and the

153
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,690
Germanic army that works so what is the
story

154
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:38,180
Arminius has witnessed Ronald's control
of other traumatic flowers in fact

155
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,370
Arminius is killed of the Germanic
tribes on the hostile rock and he comes

156
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:50,210
back home to simple people from roads
and hot baths and heated floors of olive

157
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,550
oil he comes back to his mud huts and so
on and so forth and he realizes that

158
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:02,870
bran are going to do cos she his tribal
health and he goes about setting up a

159
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,340
plan with other Germanic tribes
including the truce key which is the

160
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,680
track that Arminius is from and
basically where he does is he manages to

161
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,870
pull together of around 67,000 Germanic
tribe layers then what is seen is

162
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,120
probably the first unified German
attempt at acting and then he starts

163
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,760
feeding disinformation to learners
because of course the Royals believe

164
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,870
their guy on the other side so what
happens is during the summer run runs

165
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,040
into Germany tries to get a couple feet
further every year and then when winter

166
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,240
comes to go bold Germany and if I
thought it was further to the right and

167
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,410
they do this every year try to human
space and its comes this period and

168
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:56,750
Armenians historic virus
who is the Germanic governor oh it's not

169
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,300
right God is not raising his operas this
coming is a great are prizes prizes

170
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,260
operas and eventually barriers sighs in
story

171
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,959
the troops battle across the Rhine but
it's not earth will enter another way

172
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,790
surprise surprise
Armenia says to him ah this is a revolt

173
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:24,209
the other side of forest and virus the
banners decided I'm going to go quell

174
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:33,360
this rebellion right now and in the
middle of it I mean you could set up the

175
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,500
forest to follow the Germanic tribes
into a 2x2 formation through the forest

176
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,320
and then third Germans and I led to the
front on the end of this huge convoy

177
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:54,350
line and then randomly and smashed the
jobs over three days and not one of the

178
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,590
German tried that one of the robbers
ever made it back on this attack this is

179
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,689
this was called the Baris disaster

180
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:22,260
he was completely blame virus this is
known as disaster but he's he was an

181
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:28,890
incredibly good inspector this is what
is very very good he makes a Syria which

182
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,690
is the most important part broken at
this point and flex lots of tax he was

183
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:43,020
famous for crucifying 2,000 years for
the Jews uprisings and of course he was

184
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,809
going to be able to handle the amount of
rice and like I say to give you a rough

185
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,610
idea well any intruders were lost the
convoy line for the three nations with

186
00:18:53,610 --> 00:19:00,570
all the civilians attached to it was 20
kilometers long and it could march 15

187
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,939
kilometers a day
so your rough idea how many troops were

188
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:12,050
killed in this this by one billet virus
was very famous to say Augustus is very

189
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,909
famously safe give me back my three
legions but not me

190
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:22,040
virus was not killed in a battle I had
to commit suicide but this may just be

191
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,310
thought of being wrong
this is him running who's on the sword

192
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:37,280
yeah I'm like a bit of drama right the
job he really is hoping to jog away this

193
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,360
is wonderful
he becomes in the end later on a

194
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:52,969
nationalist civil complex and the sort
points to France but we forget that

195
00:19:52,970 --> 00:20:00,020
badness is at full Roman citizen in fact
his officer even the Roman military and

196
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:08,800
he completely completely changes from an
issue it really is one of their own and

197
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:20,629
give you a rough idea Robin never really
covers crosses the Rhine again as a

198
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:28,610
result of this the what they do to life
interesting they they come back and

199
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,290
retrieval of the Rhine but they have a
few movement society may urge making

200
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,220
everything ever settled and then they
aren't for a foreign policy where they

201
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,640
will fund either side of a Germanic
tribe dispute something wonderfully

202
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,660
wrong with about this like no no no no
let's give weapons to both of them

203
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:54,560
hahaha
okay wrong you nice guys okay

204
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:03,950
so this is what happens to this is
Colonia come on so you can see where the

205
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:10,770
truce bizarro here this is content
for Arminius this 6,000 people in this

206
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:18,570
pool and this green now is the area that
grows bigger we also see them to

207
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:23,250
something out we will see the end of
Germanic tribes being used by the Romans

208
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:30,090
in this capacity so tonight I try to be
used as well as most people guarding

209
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:35,399
Emperor's for a long time
mostly because you don't trust me wrong

210
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,520
so of course in trust of our area and
barbarians in interesting times do

211
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,440
barbarians along with mystic it
basically describes the way that we see

212
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:56,190
barbarians come true
the Romans this is what you gave me to

213
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,680
drink later suppose so they stopped
using Virge many tribes they stopped

214
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,220
payment heart in the wrong consumption
men at war and die quest here we go

215
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:18,870
but back in Germania Tacitus describes
the zoo animals finally sweet sweetness

216
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,580
forbidden to be a criminal right

217
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:32,370
I swear to God if I can trust me it's
this picture can we not go through chemo

218
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:41,600
right this day so Tessa says describes
Damania and 4445 and about their shorts

219
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,199
we're a pretty powerful tribe they Kings
were very much into bling they like gold

220
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,370
when they do they reminds me off and
they also developed ships that had

221
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,850
powers of both dressing
they also talks about some weird

222
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:17,600
hairstyle okay so so Texas is talking
about sweetie before sweetie

223
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,639
so in Romans talk about demonic tribes
actually talking about the Norse as well

224
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:33,900
because Damania is everything simply no
no they'd be batshit insane they're

225
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,620
they're not cultured gods they bah bah
bah bah bah also about the Tacitus just

226
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:48,770
describe the top Akili out with their
hair

227
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,809
so they don't hear that they've been
pestis in Sweden before Sweden became

228
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:04,940
mainstream thank you this was one of the
greatest historical discoveries of my

229
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:14,480
fucking life I actually had people at
this point this is amazing that's been

230
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:24,290
blaring hipsters forever literally but
this is the interesting thing

231
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:33,909
double powerful this isn't what Tacitus
is described this is an evolution very

232
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,750
interestingly enough when its star will
fall from as well as based off these

233
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:46,580
bonuses was these caused a loss of shit
a hunker down post so much so that the

234
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:54,649
Viking areas scene is beginning with a
raid on England or Venice per basic oh

235
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,550
my god the monster coming in there
horrible is basically long story short

236
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:10,928
this quote but that story starts wait it
starts before LeBron with the guards

237
00:25:14,010 --> 00:26:03,910
so because it was and they had this
distinct period huge world so much so

238
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,290
that he can have to do walls there's
always be choked by a may be no war

239
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,860
would stop like that wall in that
journey that night and the one in

240
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:18,760
Scotland is stolen and great it's on
sofa and the one in Jomon ian is mud and

241
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,900
wood and so on and so forth so the
Germans were using the newer materials

242
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:29,680
from back in the day to day but this
movement by the dollars and buy

243
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:37,120
batteries as well shit roads have rung
South room sat couple times and

244
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,600
eventually what happens rollin calls
back its allegiance and this option to

245
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:52,330
say hey this is not to keep the Scots
Elvis to keep English in credible

246
00:26:52,330 --> 00:27:02,139
engineering feat as well like to
builders huge thing with no slap

247
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:08,410
no email no zero you know all the other
things that we bitch about having big

248
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:14,440
projects of these guys plan so prom
cools its legions out of Britain which

249
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:23,320
causes a power vacuum a huge power and
the pics might be they go hollow include

250
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,879
we took the English this point
hello over there the other side of the

251
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:36,340
world by having back so very scared
organized Brits who aren't currently

252
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:43,030
organized Christine eyes have no real
language of their own how much support

253
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:50,170
from wrong they great to go and ask you
to support and home well you know we

254
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:55,420
borrow shit to deal with you're on your
own the papers calm the the cells come

255
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,760
is a huge problem and of course what you
do when you leave under five are

256
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,500
barriers is get more barbarians or to
defend you to being fucked by the others

257
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:12,100
makes perfect sense
and that's how you can handle exactly so

258
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,139
when the animals and the senses change
yeah they call the pigs and then they

259
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,570
went you know what I think the state and
the roadman Brits were like no no we'd

260
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,139
like to leave

261
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:31,370
I mean it literally is this is how you
become an anglo-saxon trainer but you're

262
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,729
like a bunch of displaced North people
and say here's the grass and farmer

263
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:43,040
defend it from the other bad guys on two
climbers but the end is the present case

264
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:55,899
the cost though they were very very
close what's interesting about this is

265
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:04,220
we can see the description of the games
are susceptible sweet and of the Danes

266
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:11,980
and was the brother of that who's that

267
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:25,100
so okay I have this kind of massive
realization and it literally does work

268
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,699
work out I mean it's like all those the
link back to sweet except north of us so

269
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:41,170
bear with me Viking raids remember
Tacitus described about this and this

270
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:47,540
turned out to be mainly Jews protojet
right the back of it they build and they

271
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,080
build and they build and all of a sudden
have these rating the products

272
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:59,840
specifically built for speed that could
no and take your

273
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:08,299
a feature a turn into a sign of weakness
so they're able to like the safety and

274
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:16,730
build their defensive fortresses using
rivers streams and lakes to be their

275
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,710
vehicle and then they would cover a
defensive orchard Burgesses in front to

276
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:28,630
stop the land armies come and of course
this one change this advancement you

277
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:40,970
turn this feature into did you matter
remember fire water ship which imagine

278
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,440
that heavenly fire would let in a vodka
that's exactly what these people don't

279
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,570
accept with a lot more swords and that's

280
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:59,510
also one fact the Viking doesn't making
them sneak restrictions for the 19th

281
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:07,820
century this is not the time the British
accesses are ending used described by

282
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:14,120
dates this is a turn the Vikings used to
describe Isles was never as into the

283
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,539
19th century men from the Norse God
please protect me from the north now

284
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:25,190
never Bibles and where the world comes
from is quite controversial its are

285
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,659
controversial it's not sure it either
means like quick raids or it describes a

286
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:40,880
particular for specific so not only
responsible for biking rains also

287
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,950
England is complete your guys over to
write just well they're going to

288
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:52,809
disperse the negotiation stuff - maybe
remember the

289
00:31:54,060 --> 00:32:03,760
so only one sheet conflict they went and
they Google says make it and goes absent

290
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,750
and wonderful story about how Britain as
soon as they cool the Romans out stopped

291
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,190
being Christian and went back to his
pagan ways and then of all the people in

292
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,280
the world
Christie is read Christian eyes the

293
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,100
rivers
it was the Irish the Irish came around

294
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,230
and it through Scotland Britain became
Christianized and Daniel and then in the

295
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:32,650
real British Way of fuckin of the Irish
yet again they decided not to listen to

296
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,120
any more of the Roman Catholic Church or
hey thanks for bringing us to party but

297
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,370
we're gonna stay with that so
responsible think responsible for raise

298
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:48,189
responsible for England responsible for
bringing an army against us was at the

299
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:54,340
top now I think that's probably the
worst fire hall you should probably have

300
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:59,590
the public you saw at this one so going
back to the original question from your

301
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,980
harness

302
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,499
so I can talk about wrong being each
human conquests this is an interesting

303
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:17,309
problem
so Rosen's expansionism requires it to

304
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:22,918
include arms not only to beat them with
consuming so conquered iron conquered

305
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:31,759
territories would become suppliers that
man army what could possibly go wrong I

306
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:37,379
can talk about how the most people grew
up in a culture of wrong with

307
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:42,718
expansionism this warrior even if you
look at how one comes around Roman

308
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:48,049
Romulus and Remus is a story of brother
can brother

309
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:57,629
steezy and glory and this is the people
that grew up with your ancestors popular

310
00:33:57,629 --> 00:34:04,589
and had a huge impact on where they went
forward with that I can talk about the

311
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:09,918
Germanic and the most people with
hansung the Empire which is wonderful so

312
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:18,779
here on the front this is a fun his day
long which is your guys you guys are

313
00:34:18,779 --> 00:34:23,909
over here
the Norse legacy Byzantium empires what

314
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:29,639
happens when Roman Empire idiocy
so again Germanic and the Norse people

315
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:41,940
inherited the entire Western Roman
Empire amazing and really because and

316
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,849
also never mining pipes would let

317
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,629
this is wonderful
if you talk about nurses that most

318
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:58,960
people's greater skill of getting lost
I mean your ancestry to get lost to a

319
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,960
whole fuckin new level
solutely right i mean you will find the

320
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,670
biking somewhere just purely because he
got corn of course way I talk about

321
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:15,700
transatlantic colonization and here is a
very focused map

322
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:21,250
and this is Big Island over here in
Finland is a story comes out when the

323
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:30,670
Saudis about lunch Oh a bunch of Vikings
heading for Greenland and getting lost

324
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:37,329
so I mean like you guys they're lost way
and they got out to the coast we found

325
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:44,079
no hardship this trees you don't only
see that factors breathing that's

326
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,940
unusual
we should go over a couple of main they

327
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,220
eventually colonize this area for small
pace of time and we're gonna get the

328
00:35:54,220 --> 00:36:00,819
Finland from there is wonderful so you
can take the red that Vikings normal

329
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:04,240
wine is but I have another fuckin idea
how it's made

330
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:11,379
so hum they like drinking it or how this
thing happens is unusual so somebody

331
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,790
comes running back to the drivers look
at these berries these are what they

332
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:22,710
make wine from how we should call this
by mind they work wonders

333
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:28,960
but of course the bike next a 13 X
amount of arbitrators oh you know but

334
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,120
this is interesting the lamina so there
is a one huge problem this is a map

335
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:40,569
that's discovered the basically says
haha columnist in final America dividers

336
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:48,010
from North America first and it is about
five years before plumbers coming was

337
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:55,240
how we want the real issue with this map
is the detection fucking exists because

338
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:03,879
your people were not exactly known for
map in fact there is no wrong with maps

339
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,760
which was kinda the alarm bell when
someone said little brother map really

340
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:18,760
because we just got lost bad things
so here's the interesting thing the

341
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:41,740
story
and although the screaming's was the

342
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,569
mainly the news foods me screams I think
shelters the tracks people of North

343
00:37:46,570 --> 00:38:03,180
America managed to chase a Columbus guys

344
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:09,930
we could also talk about the wonderful
case of Greenland aka

345
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,290
Greenland is anything but we just just
so that I'm sure you guys realize this

346
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:22,060
but it's true it's not very clean it's
not kind of the place that we call Green

347
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:29,770
Line it's also quite a fuse it was
Icelanders as well and this is purely

348
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:37,840
about saying no no it's such a wonderful
place to live that's why it's green this

349
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,150
is where Audrina and I mean brilliant
there's no space here

350
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:54,280
I'll stop fighting is everywhere green
I'm basically ice and I decide okay the

351
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,200
18 months they took me to get me over 12
months whatever I turn around or about

352
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,759
common you know what I like fish so a
lot of people stayed but Korean really

353
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:15,540
is biking market about the protests and
the mainly in the slave trade

354
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:22,900
which is huge absolutely huge and most
people the biggest suppliers were slaves

355
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:33,580
to the Muslim world with ever seen when
black slaves became Islam Muslim

356
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:45,150
countries it was the noise that when you
inked people and some of these markets

357
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:52,150
talk about things but that be because
using do we think about things I have

358
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:59,760
things are fucking awesome
it took me a long time to realize that

359
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:10,700
and the thing is basically a clayey
democracy I'm also talk about how you

360
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:17,089
guys responsible for flight or Viking
battle rap and this is fighting this

361
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:23,480
inning scholars to battle each other
even man poems where you infuse each

362
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:31,040
other which is basically battle rap
exactly just the fucking same if you've

363
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,380
ever watched battle that they write man
corners to abuse each other in time

364
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:44,900
grounds just like lighting is fucking
amazing I mean guys in Russia about the

365
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:56,900
awkward to still my most famous favorite
fucking troll if you imagine being a

366
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:10,250
Russian submarine them and seen back
father this is this is a rich chieftain

367
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:19,670
being better looks very very directly of
the Swedish norms people who was point

368
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:29,119
two so Russia's probably just trying to
come back for myself and what I click

369
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,520
talk about I really want to talk about
is where the Scandinavians that part of

370
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,580
the military
complex they were hugely involved in the

371
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:45,759
supply of arms weapons and military
equipment to nuuma Shanghai's in fact

372
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,640
most wealth was accumulated either via
they had so much wealth that they would

373
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,819
bury it under the house seriously like
oh we've got so many still the points

374
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,500
that we've buried one of the first
tactics would be to go and occupy a line

375
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:14,230
and then you have to pay them to leave
basically back somewhere and they turn

376
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:23,110
up somewhere and cause absolutely say to
people give me money give me money only

377
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:33,670
to you okay and they would give tons of
gold or silver those all the way back to

378
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:40,810
those things that love the bling and the
accumulation of wealth in these periods

379
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:45,750
like this there's so much they would
find them in

380
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:51,430
foundations of buildings not accessible
right so not like you could open up a

381
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:55,690
trapdoor and here's these forty thousand
silver coins we start from I call the

382
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:00,970
raid over and everything right they'd be
literally putting it in the ground and

383
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:06,220
they don't know why no my story has an
idea way hardrock maybe you guys have

384
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,600
tried throwing money treaters

385
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,890
but that evolved and you can see from
having this consumerism the biggest

386
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:24,580
Empire one in five people lived in the
Roman Empire you go up around the sides

387
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:31,240
of it with no luck than nothing having
to spray around every Roman Empire

388
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,120
collapses it becomes a free-for-all and
then eventually you guys become

389
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:46,950
prominent you know settle areas generate
them in a lot of ways to bring more

390
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:53,560
England laws based and they so this huge
right but the rats that money by the way

391
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:59,920
is called Dania literally dating you are
all babies Angels by home to the handles

392
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,250
by the way they have us just beat
description they didn't make any

393
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,750
difference if you actually came so we've
talked about the military-industrial

394
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:13,710
complex around but then I have to leave
some questions
