1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
all right this is my third time back and

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,819
I really do appreciate the opportunity

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
to come back here because this is

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,139
actually one of my favorite conferences

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,269
Bar None and yes i actually run a couple

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:16,198
on the side but yet no i really do enjoy

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:20,820
coming here I am back this year to talk

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:24,840
about zero trust and trying to just get

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,939
this spell a lot of the confusion around

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,550
it by adding more confusion no doubt now

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,219
so for those of you who may not know me

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,920
my name is Dave Lewis I am Canadian and

13
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,989
I have been doing security now for the

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,500
better part of twenty five years in one

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,839
form or another and it has been quite a

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,030
ride I've had all sorts of different

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,530
positions and along the way I've done

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,450
everything from being a firewall augment

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,840
right through to being a CSO for a power

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,699
company and it has been amazing when I

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,170
have conversations with folks as I go

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,420
around the world they asked me well how

23
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,910
do you identify yourself and I said well

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:06,810
I identify myself as a hacker but if you

25
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:09,360
have look around be if people don't like

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,890
us too much so I think it's really

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,220
incumbent upon us to actually manage

28
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,979
that narrative yes as I said I am

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,570
Canadian and so much so that I actually

30
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,030
had to go get this done

31
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,979
now this has happened since the last

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,030
time I was here I got this tattoo on my

33
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,340
arm if you'll notice there's a Canadian

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,170
maple leaf in there and the reason this

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,390
happened was about two years ago I was

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,829
in a hotel lobby in India and this

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,600
well-dressed woman walked up to me she

38
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,298
goes excuse me are you an American I

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,780
said well no one from Canada why just

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,780
good

41
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,780
that was the most disturbing moment of

42
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,460
my life and I went okay I've been really

43
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,340
big into talking about zero trust even

44
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,600
before I ever joined duo security and I

45
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,690
thought you know what I want to have

46
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,729
that extra authentication so Canadians

47
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,360
really easy to identify in our natural

48
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,770
habitat

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,929
we're dress like homicidal maniacs going

50
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,580
across a sheet of ice sorry about your

51
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,630
game last night with Finland but we'll

52
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,520
go on with that I do a security at work

53
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,990
is a global security adviser which means

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,329
I get to go around talk to wonderful

55
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,770
people like you and then back in October

56
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,500
this happened

57
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:18,500
Cisco bought us at first I'll be honest

58
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,840
I had fear and trepidation I had been

59
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,980
through many many acquisitions but I was

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,110
always part of the company that was

61
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,030
doing the acquiring and it was very

62
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,220
jarring being in a role where I went

63
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,930
okay am I gonna have a job tomorrow it

64
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,540
has turned out to actually be an

65
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,910
incredibly good experience which was

66
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,230
amazing so much so that we're even now

67
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,630
on their own website but that's as

68
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,130
vendor as I'm gonna get right now the

69
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,220
one thing that we did miss is an

70
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,230
opportunity with the acquisition was

71
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,290
when you had duo you had Cisco you could

72
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,060
have been disco but that's another thing

73
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:53,510
mad props to Wendy neither my boss who

74
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,640
came up with that one so our mission is

75
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,880
really simple to protect your mission so

76
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,798
what is zero trust what is the idea

77
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,000
honestly when we go back to it we look

78
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:04,430
at the roots of this have been around

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,280
for 25 30 years network zone

80
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,890
segmentation user assets user management

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,510
or other asset databases all of these

82
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,149
different components have been here all

83
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,519
along just somewhere along the line we

84
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,459
sort of got away from that to chase that

85
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,110
move shiny and this is a real problem

86
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,329
because we have gotten away from dealing

87
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,250
with core fundamentals and honestly zero

88
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,140
Trust is a wrapper for a lot of these

89
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,730
core fundamentals about how we should

90
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,190
have been doing security all along I

91
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,570
prefer to use the term trusted access

92
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,760
and I'll talk about that a little bit

93
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,230
more later but it just seems to be more

94
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,450
of a positive and this was I gave the

95
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,488
today's 72 hours ago I gave a talk in

96
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,420
Las Vegas and people said well zero

97
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,970
Trust has got such a negative

98
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,280
connotation I said yes but people are

99
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,900
paying attention so there is a positive

100
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,900
aspect to it so then we'll take that

101
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,730
zero trust and become trusted

102
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,360
so if I ask everybody in this room what

103
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,130
is love

104
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,480
I can guarantee you I'm going to get a

105
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,030
different answer from every single one

106
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,619
of you and this is very much where the

107
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,080
conversation around zero trust has

108
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,300
gotten us to and so when people ask me

109
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,710
what is Euro trust and the root of it is

110
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:14,420
really simple everything is on fire you

111
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,950
have to consider the things on the

112
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,390
inside of your network is on the outside

113
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,620
of your network as being a problem

114
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,870
because the problems will happen when

115
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,970
you least expect it

116
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,000
now as security practitioners we often

117
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:32,210
feel like this guy at least I have for

118
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,830
the last 25 years and he's just in a

119
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:39,460
non-stop painful pain point so back in

120
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,870
2000 it's actually closer to 2003 I'm

121
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,430
still trying to nail down the date but a

122
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,930
group called the Jericho forum came out

123
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,090
with a paper on deeper memorization

124
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,630
which was basically a precursor to zero

125
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,619
trust and this was the whole idea of

126
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,330
exactly that looking at network zone

127
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,070
segmentation all the rest of it locking

128
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,630
it right down making sure you had acid

129
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,550
inventories and all the rest of it and

130
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:03,140
then in 2010 John kinder bog who was a

131
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,970
analyst at Forrester at the time came up

132
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,530
with the term and you know what that was

133
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,560
great because people started paying

134
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,119
attention and then 2014 Google came out

135
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,770
with their own paper where they

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,060
discussed their implementation called

137
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:20,570
beyond Corp and honestly that was pretty

138
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,890
cool what's even cooler is in about 2017

139
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,880
they came out with a report card but

140
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,370
I'll talk about that a little bit more

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,469
in a bit and this is amazing so let's

142
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,400
just before you wonder about zero trust

143
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,500
in your own environment

144
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,080
realize it's an incremental discussion

145
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,350
right you have to go a little bit at a

146
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,900
time because it took Google seven years

147
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,220
to roll out their implementation so

148
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,530
don't feel bad if it's taking you a

149
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,150
while if you want to know more about it

150
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,979
after this talk there's a great book

151
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,120
here called zero trust networks the

152
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,040
really interesting thing about this is I

153
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,570
know none of the authors and I have no

154
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,900
play on this but this is actually an

155
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:56,810
excellent resource to get into so the IT

156
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,060
landscape is changing in many ways we

157
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,070
have gone from being a perimeter with a

158
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,350
castle wall and everything on the inside

159
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,289
to cloud implementations everywhere SAS

160
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,899
based offerings all the rest of it are

161
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,759
please or mobile I live on the road I

162
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,259
couldn't even imagine having to go back

163
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,080
in the office to get my email because

164
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,610
it's like downloading 25,000 emails it

165
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,389
would be really frustrating you need to

166
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,610
be able to work anywhere we've gone to

167
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,129
multiple cloud access platforms wherever

168
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,800
it happens to be is your company using

169
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,469
outlook spot or the office 365 are you

170
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,699
using Gmail whatever it happens to be is

171
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:35,289
are your companies using BYOD and the

172
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,240
thing is you want to prevent breaches

173
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,419
it's all about reducing the risk in your

174
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,219
environment so beyond Corp was their own

175
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:43,659
implementation at Google so as I was

176
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:45,189
going through right through to 2017 they

177
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,719
came out with a report card and how they

178
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:48,099
were doing and they were rather

179
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:49,539
transparent with it which was really

180
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:52,539
amazing because I look at this as an

181
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:55,300
excellent way for people to learn how

182
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,159
things went for them because we've gone

183
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,899
from a traditional approach of having

184
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:00,938
that you know network access controls

185
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,349
and firewalls and that was it right

186
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:04,749
through to where the access decisions

187
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:07,360
are being made so the perimeter used to

188
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:08,919
be the wall you this is your firewall

189
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,800
that was it everything's fine on the

190
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,599
inside which never was but now it's the

191
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,389
perimeter is really any tire and access

192
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,789
decision that's being made now we all

193
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,959
love our triads so this is a really

194
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,909
simple way to look at it you have your

195
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,309
apps your devices and you have your

196
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:27,129
users when you're looking to do a zero

197
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:28,539
trust type of implementation I'm not

198
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:31,389
sure if you're taking a picture there or

199
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:33,639
not okay as we're going through it the

200
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,469
easiest way to start is you know well

201
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,729
even below this is having an asset

202
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:38,649
inventory of the devices in your

203
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:40,389
organization but you want to confirm you

204
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:42,789
user identities let's see if my laser

205
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,559
works today yay gain access visibility

206
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:47,318
so you want to see what your users are

207
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:48,819
trying to do you want to insure device

208
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,099
security so you want to make sure you're

209
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:53,879
having the same type of security

210
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,930
configuration across all your devices

211
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,849
you want to be able to enforce

212
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:01,149
contextual policies so that you don't

213
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:02,649
have HR being able to access production

214
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,779
and dev systems that they don't need to

215
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,580
get to and be able to secure access to

216
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,819
all the applications that you use in

217
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,019
your environment and over the years one

218
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,490
of the things that I've really got every

219
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:15,430
go talk about this day one of the things

220
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,520
I look back is that I learned a valuable

221
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,940
lesson a long time ago is

222
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,698
hasil simply don't scale when I worked

223
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:27,690
at a power company back in mid 2000s I

224
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:30,270
had the CIO look at me and say this we

225
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,599
trust everything inside our firewall

226
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,069
because we trust everyone who works here

227
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,260
this is such a fractured notion just

228
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,300
because something is he on the inside of

229
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,088
your network doesn't mean you should

230
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,529
trust it now we all like to think of

231
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,000
ourselves as being environmentally

232
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,720
conscious environmentally friendly but

233
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,209
please do not recycle passwords we have

234
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,740
this really bad habit as humans that we

235
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,689
will use the same username and password

236
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,850
you know password one password to

237
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,130
whatever happens to be on multiple sites

238
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,680
so if you're using it for your internet

239
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,360
banking and your email and your Amazon

240
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,180
account or whatever it happens to be and

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,500
one of those gets compromised what the

242
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,000
attackers like to do is take those

243
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,230
credentials and then use them against

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,089
other sites to see what else they can

245
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,579
gain access to typically refer to as

246
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,860
credential stuffing don't make their job

247
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:18,750
easier if you have to use a static

248
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,700
password use a different one use a

249
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,560
password manager there are multiple

250
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,440
types of password managers out there and

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,939
if you have relatives that are doing

252
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,470
this whether you know they're using the

253
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,959
same username password convince them to

254
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,279
use a password manager there's multiple

255
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,939
choices out there that you can pick from

256
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:39,649
my folks are in their 70s I got them to

257
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,610
use a password manager if I can do it

258
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,200
but the thing is with the password

259
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,020
that's really a deprecated notion that's

260
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,870
something that isn't as effective as

261
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,089
some might think so if you come forward

262
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,010
and you say you know here's my password

263
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:55,440
that does nothing to confirm who you are

264
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,300
now ultimately as a defender you want to

265
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,490
say nope go away this isn't gonna happen

266
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,800
but the reality here is you want to have

267
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,300
something better than that

268
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,910
security paradigms have to shift to a

269
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,979
positive state I just noticed this up

270
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,949
here and that is really cool

271
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,410
yes I'm easily distracted so before I

272
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,060
ever got into computer security at all I

273
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,060
was doing a degree in classical studies

274
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,040
in archeology long story on how I got

275
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,689
here but this is one of the really

276
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,180
interesting lessons that I've taken from

277
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:27,029
that training was the fall of Rome in

278
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,890
410 AD now the Visigoths showed up they

279
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:31,400
set up shop and locked down access to

280
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,990
the city nothing in or out

281
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,120
within a period of time the Romans ran

282
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,440
out of food they ran out of supplies and

283
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,960
they threw open the door to said we give

284
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,730
up the attackers were used they able to

285
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,000
use their own security paradigm against

286
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,430
them a perimeter base-model

287
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,520
the old way of having the firewall and

288
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:55,469
the perimeter was demonstrably proven as

289
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,970
a broken security defense in 410 AD and

290
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,240
yet we still see that in a lot of

291
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,800
networks today now being Canadian we

292
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,300
have a lot of bears so one of the

293
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,740
analogies we like to use is you always

294
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,510
want to be faster than the hiker that's

295
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,950
right behind you not that I have any

296
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,870
experience on that

297
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,780
black bears apparently can't run that

298
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,550
fast thankfully sorry Bob

299
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,140
but this is the same thing applies with

300
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,939
security you want to make sure you're

301
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,680
doing a better job and as you're going

302
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,680
through and doing a better job you have

303
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,060
to realize that what was once a case of

304
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,890
you just had to keep it away from the

305
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,859
one threat there are now many more

306
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,360
threats to deal with the really funny

307
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,340
thing about this particular slide is

308
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,350
when I was giving this talk in Bogota

309
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,450
Colombia there was the military attache

310
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,180
from the Russian embassy sitting up in

311
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:42,930
the front and he didn't quite like that

312
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:44,790
sorry so the whole idea when you're

313
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,010
looking at it from a trusted access

314
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,230
approach and reduce is reducing the risk

315
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,060
you want to make sure you are reducing

316
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,100
the risk you're never going to be to a

317
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,800
hundred percent so just weighed yourself

318
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,240
with that notion right now but you can

319
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,920
get to a much better place from a

320
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,200
security impact and the thing is if the

321
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,490
attackers are stymied by the controls

322
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,500
that you put in place they'll go on to

323
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,280
try and attack somebody else so you've

324
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,450
done your job to protect your enterprise

325
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,050
now we want to make sure that we don't

326
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:15,870
turn into this guy this guy is actually

327
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:19,050
analogous to someone I worked with many

328
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,180
many years ago and I refer to him as the

329
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,839
flaming sword of justice his entire

330
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,489
mantra was how do we get to know anytime

331
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,020
there was any sort of indiscretion on

332
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,890
the network he wanted to have the power

333
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:34,650
to fire that individual it was insane at

334
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,660
one point I had a early iteration of

335
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,490
Twitter open on my desktop and the web

336
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,730
browser was refreshing in the background

337
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,940
and well apparently that was the denial

338
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,820
of service attack in his

339
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,580
let that sink in for a second this is

340
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,980
the way old school security really was

341
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,080
done in many organizations this whole

342
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,330
flaming sword of justice getting to know

343
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,860
is not an effective way for us as

344
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,930
security practitioners to do our job

345
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,960
we're there to enable the business but

346
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,599
to do it in a safe and secure fashion

347
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,520
because this is going to keep happening

348
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,050
data' breech after data breach how many

349
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,270
people here by a show of hands are

350
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,839
familiar with Amazon s3 buckets or AWS

351
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:18,930
s3 buckets gyro that's the best response

352
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:23,190
I've had yet awesome so the problem here

353
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:26,130
with s3 buckets is by default I'll say

354
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,340
that again by default these are not set

355
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,689
to public access unfortunately a lot of

356
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:35,070
the data breaches we've seen in the last

357
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:37,110
year have actually had their buckets set

358
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,730
to public access there are multiple

359
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,050
scanners that you can find on github

360
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,180
that will allow you iterate through

361
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,560
these and looking for resources like

362
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,000
this that are freely available and for

363
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,260
those of you don't know an s3 bucket is

364
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,660
a data repository where you can put

365
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,970
image files data files whatever it

366
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,829
happens to be and if you make them

367
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,020
freely available bad things are going to

368
00:13:52,830 --> 00:14:01,530
happen now these are not s3 related but

369
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:04,530
Marriott kora Cedric these are examples

370
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:06,689
that this can happen to anyone and it is

371
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,370
not to throw any aspersions towards

372
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:11,120
these companies but it just shows that

373
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,360
anybody is susceptible to a data breach

374
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,300
now with the DB our report that came out

375
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,220
two weeks ago now one of the things that

376
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,359
went through it 81% of the credentials

377
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,080
that revolved native breaches we're

378
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,390
using weak credentials we love to blame

379
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,640
the user we need to stop doing that

380
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,470
because if the user is using a password

381
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,780
of one two three four or QWERTY or

382
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,580
whatever it happens to be that's because

383
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,430
we haven't either trained them properly

384
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,320
on how we expect them to do security or

385
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,979
we haven't given them the tools to do a

386
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,670
better job multi-factor authentication

387
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,620
biometrics whatever happens to be

388
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:50,339
something better than the static

389
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,670
password the perimeters that we have to

390
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,830
deal with

391
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,569
our poorest to say the very least we

392
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,460
have all sorts of traffic traversing our

393
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:02,830
enterprise however it is structured

394
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:05,200
hybrid cloud on-premise beat and we have

395
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,170
to evolve our thinking as to what that

396
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,500
perimeter is now this is a quote

397
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,510
directly from my boss yes hello

398
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,220
the perimeters anywhere is an access

399
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,780
decision was being made I used to think

400
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,670
that the data was the perimeter but

401
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,939
honestly I like this a whole lot better

402
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:24,760
because is really more apt and our

403
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,500
perimeter has changed we have all sorts

404
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,590
of different access coming into our

405
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,490
networks remote employees whatever it

406
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,620
happens to be now one of my favorite

407
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,880
ones with remote employees I worked for

408
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,520
one power company years ago where we had

409
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,970
developers in India that we're doing

410
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,439
code development for us and they were

411
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,060
doing a fine job and everything but one

412
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,000
day we decided to do an audit of access

413
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:50,800
to the network in the space of about

414
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,970
less than an illicit less than three

415
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,099
hours or something like that we had nine

416
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,200
different people log in from different

417
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,910
places around India and they were all

418
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,650
using the same key fob so they were

419
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,329
calling in to get the number somebody to

420
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,270
read it to them over the phone and then

421
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,380
they would enter it and off they went

422
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,960
obviously this was a problem and it was

423
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,360
not so much a problem with we they were

424
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,370
doing things his problem was we hadn't

425
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,080
told them what we expected there was no

426
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,480
security requirements baked into the

427
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,280
contract at no point did we say this is

428
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,490
good this is bad so they were just

429
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,780
operating in a way that was effective

430
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:27,400
you know what skunkworks happened

431
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:28,780
because something is missing with the

432
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,670
zero trust model you want to look at

433
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,579
dealing with access how are you managing

434
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,949
your users in your environment that is

435
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,240
one of the key pieces the devices that

436
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,410
you're using in your environment are you

437
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,060
having corporate assets are you allowing

438
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,160
external assets how are you handling

439
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:46,390
those and the applications that they're

440
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,040
using a couple of marketing looking

441
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,569
slides but they're not the whole idea

442
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,819
here is you want to be able to give

443
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:54,160
folks the same access that they're using

444
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,810
at a coffee shop as they would see in

445
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,579
the office as they would see at home

446
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,339
you want to make that uniform across the

447
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,200
board because if we don't do a better

448
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,240
job of managing how people are accessing

449
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,870
things stuff like this is going to keep

450
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,209
happening

451
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,549
now my own website I started tracking

452
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:12,039
data breaches back in 2012 because

453
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:14,079
apparently I need a hobby but here a

454
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,970
third row down LinkedIn six and a half

455
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,500
million records at the time that was

456
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,689
huge news

457
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,059
but these days we're dealing with record

458
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:23,400
breaches in the order of magnitude of a

459
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:27,849
billion records

460
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,520
this is absolutely maddening so why do

461
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,469
we keep getting worse and it's painful

462
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,900
too I know how painful it is because

463
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,179
I've lived through it this here is an

464
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,250
actual screen grab from a company I was

465
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:40,450
working at where the website was one of

466
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,270
the websites that we had was actually

467
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,710
compromised this was one of those

468
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,570
unnerving moments where I came into work

469
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,830
sat down had my coffee on my desk and

470
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,559
looking there was a stack of notes there

471
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,668
from CBC and all has other publications

472
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,700
they want to talk to us about a data

473
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:56,289
breach that we had and I was like what

474
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:00,520
look at my phone multiple missed calls

475
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:02,320
oops this was a case of we had

476
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,279
identified an asset that had to be

477
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,200
retired because it was using an

478
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,429
applicative version of WordPress and we

479
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,659
said look you need to take that offline

480
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,419
they said sure no problem

481
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,970
they didn't take it off lion I didn't

482
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:15,190
blame them I blame myself that was

483
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,750
something where I could have gone and

484
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,610
followed up to make sure they had taken

485
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,289
that down I could have gotten them to

486
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,510
commit to a timeline when they took it

487
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:25,000
down but I didn't but I learned from

488
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,710
that thankfully it was only reputational

489
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,940
risk in that particular instance but

490
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:32,260
still painful nonetheless so I always

491
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,909
loved pulling out these slides this is

492
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,950
from a site information in beautiful net

493
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:37,539
this is a couple years ago this is a

494
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,520
graphical representation of various data

495
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:44,049
breaches this is a little bit more

496
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,700
recently in two years that's how bad

497
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,500
it's gotten and then we jump to now

498
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,870
where they have actually taken in Rio

499
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:54,760
architect of how they present the data

500
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:56,860
because it wouldn't fit anymore we can

501
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,559
do better than this we are better than

502
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,260
this which leads me to the question

503
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,059
what's open in Sweden so I went looking

504
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,059
around on you know everybody's favorite

505
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,428
Google for hackers showdown this is how

506
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,590
many ports were currently available

507
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:13,419
listening in Sweden at the time that I

508
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,770
checked now that doesn't mean that

509
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,690
they're all bad by any stretch of the

510
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,870
imagination but a lot of averages some

511
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,299
of them will be

512
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,889
even right down to Gothenburg we have

513
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:24,230
this many ports that we're currently

514
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,529
listening it's really amazing what

515
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:30,520
people will allow unfettered access to

516
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:33,140
somebody's garage somebody's backyard

517
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,860
I'm not really sure what that is but

518
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,840
somebody had that online and I don't

519
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,820
know if that's a pigpen or what that is

520
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,039
but all of these are from Sweden

521
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,629
none of these required me to log into

522
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,190
the site I didn't have to hack anything

523
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,890
it was just hanging out there in the

524
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,600
breeze when people are providing access

525
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,490
to something as simple as that

526
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,020
and then you extrapolate out as to what

527
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,890
other problems could be lying out there

528
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,270
we can do better so you want to make

529
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,610
sure that you're making it harder for

530
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,440
the attacker you want to devalue stolen

531
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,729
credentials so if a psychic compromising

532
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,740
usernames and passwords are dumped out

533
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:09,470
you don't want it to be easy for the

534
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,789
attacker to do their job you want to

535
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,649
make sure the low-hanging fruit go away

536
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:15,080
you don't want to have things like those

537
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:17,059
various cameras up there we're like this

538
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,129
is a simple example but it's just one to

539
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:21,590
illustrate how easy it is for people to

540
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,860
get this sort of information back in

541
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,360
2003 2002 ish I had a conversation

542
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,469
within our own organization that I was

543
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,149
working at and I said you know what

544
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,860
would be a great idea if we lock down

545
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:33,279
all the laptops and desktops and servers

546
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,928
and make it a mall Bastion hosts and

547
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,190
then we don't have to worry about you

548
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:39,230
know when they ended up in the wrong

549
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,240
Network and things like that and I

550
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,159
escaped that meeting with my life which

551
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,210
was fantastic because the support team

552
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,710
that would have had to deal with it was

553
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:50,630
there they weren't very happy with me

554
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,620
oddly enough but here we are 2019 and

555
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,960
now we're having a really good

556
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,610
productive conversation about it because

557
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,960
the way we used to do things and a lot

558
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,428
of the organizations was that he would

559
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,179
lock down everything in the DMZ they

560
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:00,620
would make sure everything

561
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:03,169
internet-facing was secure

562
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,959
but systems on the inside were

563
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:08,690
imminently vulnerable in one company I

564
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,059
worked at they had installed entire

565
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:14,120
microsoft office suites on all of the

566
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:18,379
production windows servers why well we

567
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,789
have a license for it so they thought it

568
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,720
was a good idea to put this on

569
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:25,158
production servers but you know what

570
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,899
okay so as we're going through and we're

571
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,980
talking about how do we gonna get to the

572
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:29,719
zero trust how are we going to start

573
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,590
locking things down you want to make

574
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,670
sure that you're setting your

575
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,370
expectations within

576
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,960
our own organization don't say all I

577
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,959
want to get zero trust certified doesn't

578
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,110
exist it is an iterative process it is

579
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,910
something to aspire to and you want to

580
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,770
make sure that every time you're doing

581
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,380
something that you're trying to get to a

582
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,700
better place than you were before

583
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,980
because a lot of these that goes back to

584
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,360
dealing with core fundamentals even

585
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,970
something as simple as looking at your

586
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,250
log files not many companies do that

587
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,890
which is really jarring when you think

588
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,530
about it it is a game of increments

589
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,260
where every little bit is a win and you

590
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,430
have to celebrate those wins but before

591
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,690
you get and celebrating the wins you

592
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,730
want to determine what those priorities

593
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,920
are within your organization what is it

594
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,560
you're trying to achieve before you ever

595
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,240
talk to any vendor out there you want to

596
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,060
make sure you do your homework bless you

597
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,280
you want to make sure that you

598
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,810
understand what it is you need for your

599
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,030
environment because it's gonna be

600
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:28,280
misspoke it is not going to be a one

601
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,020
size fits all for every company like a

602
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,970
vulnerability scanner come a company

603
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,400
comes in says oh your ratings are high

604
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,870
medium and low that means nothing to you

605
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,720
and your particular organization you

606
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:41,050
need to tailor it accordingly you want

607
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,270
to be able to deal with attacks in a way

608
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:46,639
that you understand how to beat them so

609
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,020
if a credential dump happens and you

610
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,760
don't know about it for several weeks

611
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,129
and the attackers are using these

612
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,080
credentials to get into your company how

613
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,350
do you know it looks like legitimate

614
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,929
traffic so if you're using multi-factor

615
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,189
authentication as an example the

616
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,480
attacker won't be able to use those

617
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,640
credential dumps because they only have

618
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,780
part of the equation they only have the

619
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,730
username the password they don't have

620
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,710
the third factor they don't have the

621
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:12,920
device that is in your inventory that is

622
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,600
registered you want to make sure that

623
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,550
you verify your users in your

624
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,800
environment verify your devices and

625
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,810
protect every application that you're

626
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,330
using you don't want to have somebody

627
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,460
that is sitting in a coffee shop in

628
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,010
London accessing your resources on your

629
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,830
email accounts when they're not one of

630
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,360
your company staff you don't want some

631
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:36,230
pesky Canadian coming in and causing

632
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,909
trouble it's really simple you take the

633
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,430
user you go against your source of truth

634
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,170
say Active Directory is an example check

635
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,590
in the device inventory yep that's great

636
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:47,159
then ignore

637
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:48,418
these vendor e stuff verify all of that

638
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,520
and then you can get access to

639
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,919
everything here it's really simple it

640
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,370
all of these controls are all parts of

641
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,630
elements that have always existed you

642
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,729
want to make sure you're going through

643
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:01,049
and looking at the trusted users in your

644
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,480
environment who are they

645
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:05,400
if one company that I worked at we did

646
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,010
an audit of all of our users and we

647
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,230
found that there were about 10 to 20

648
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,419
users that had super user privileges or

649
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,919
better not better but super user

650
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:18,539
privileges

651
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,010
okay a plus plus but of them 10 of them

652
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:22,110
no longer worked at the company one of

653
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,970
them had passed away five years previous

654
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,620
and that at person's account had been

655
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,909
accessed three years previous or two

656
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:34,469
years previous so somehow a deceased

657
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:35,820
individual was accessing the network the

658
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,409
only reason we knew is because we had

659
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,490
gone back and done an audit there should

660
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,080
have been removed there should have been

661
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,840
mad at a better access controls better

662
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,010
staff had removed processes and

663
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,720
processes are really a great thing that

664
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:49,559
you guys can do in your own environment

665
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,690
that'll help you a great deal when the

666
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,309
attackers get that information they have

667
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,960
to have all of these individual

668
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:58,529
components in order to break into your

669
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,090
network if you have trusted devices you

670
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,770
already have that asset inventory you

671
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,678
know what you are expecting to try to

672
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,440
come knocking into your company if you

673
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,370
were you know one of the Jason Bourne's

674
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,289
colleagues trying to break into a system

675
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:13,199
system with something that was left

676
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:15,260
behind on a job at least you have that

677
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,539
in your asset inventory as marked as

678
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,789
destroyed but there it is something's

679
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:22,169
very wrong and when you're traveling

680
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:24,629
this is one of those things that really

681
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:26,789
can really bite you in my case in

682
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,799
particular so if you're doing a proper

683
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,960
type of type of implementation you're

684
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,730
looking at it you're making sure that

685
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,799
all the devices they're trying to access

686
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,669
your network are patched to current or n

687
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,470
minus one

688
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:39,929
you can now enforce that using these

689
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,610
sort of technologies this has bitten me

690
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:43,320
because I was on the road at one point

691
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,668
and I try to log in said ant your

692
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,870
browser is out of date you got updated

693
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:48,809
before you jump in and they're like oh

694
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,229
great fantastic hoisted on my own petard

695
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:53,220
but this is really a good way to help

696
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,409
interacting with the user helping and

697
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,120
forcing a good security idea with your

698
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:58,500
users to make sure that they

699
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,409
that as well because if they are

700
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:06,090
educated they will help as part of the

701
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:08,700
greater scheme you want to make sure

702
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,990
those devices are up-to-date every

703
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,760
application that you're using in your

704
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,470
environment whether it's Salesforce

705
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,330
whether it's a third party email

706
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,300
whatever it happens to be you want to be

707
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,530
able to marshal access to those things

708
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,649
and you want to have the ability to get

709
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:25,290
granular to allow access depending on

710
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,880
what it is you need to do so I actually

711
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,340
rolled out a multi-factor authentication

712
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,100
on my own website liquid matrix org for

713
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,178
our users there's about ten of us and

714
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,159
there's one user that I like to mess

715
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,840
with because you know you end up in

716
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,370
certain countries on travel and I will

717
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,860
disable this access just because I'm a

718
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,629
jerk but that's just it you can get

719
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,219
super granular as to what they can and

720
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,740
can't do or allow his browser to access

721
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,510
but he can't do certain things because

722
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,290
well apparently I have nothing better to

723
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:54,600
do beyond Corp is a great example here

724
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,280
the Google implementation the whole idea

725
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,919
here is you're leveraging stuff you

726
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,809
already have in your environment you

727
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,090
already have Network zones you already

728
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:04,920
have VPNs you already have asset

729
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,530
inventories or at least I really hope

730
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:12,690
you do I've been in organizations that

731
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:16,770
had none that was fun you want to look

732
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:18,600
at it as years of shopping list the

733
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,790
simplest way to get started dealing zero

734
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,449
trust is build your asset inventory in

735
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:27,178
whatever way works best for you you want

736
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,550
to look at your user management you want

737
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,660
to manage your devices now this year

738
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,520
like I mentioned with earlier with

739
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,770
processes a defined repeatable process

740
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,910
is something that can absolutely help

741
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,309
you and it's something you can do

742
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,380
yourselves I worked at a power company

743
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:42,360
years ago where the CIO decided this

744
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,010
year there's going to be no net new

745
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,590
projects everything is just gonna be

746
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,260
maintained that's it and we rolled out

747
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,639
ITIL in that year as painful as that

748
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,179
sounds it actually worked out really

749
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:58,650
well in our first year our rate of

750
00:27:54,179 --> 00:28:02,090
incidence drop 72% because we were using

751
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,090
defined repeatable processes

752
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,199
and once you have all of these pieces in

753
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,989
place you can start watching for user

754
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,400
behavior and analytics to see what is

755
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,440
actually going on and you can analyze

756
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,330
that data and pulling it into whatever

757
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,430
sim solution you happen to be using and

758
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,889
this here is my favorite of all time

759
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,240
network zone segmentation I worked at

760
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,130
one financial institution years ago

761
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,650
where I was able to sit at my desktop in

762
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,720
Toronto and query the mainframe and do

763
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,010
all sorts of things and then I felt

764
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,900
guilty I know what the telev about it I

765
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,910
said look I'm sorry I was trying to gain

766
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,410
access to the mainframe because I

767
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,510
thought it was a good idea I didn't ask

768
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,230
permission first they went oh we didn't

769
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,550
know they had no logging there was no

770
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,060
connection between the back office and

771
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:47,250
the mainframe that would have stopped me

772
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,440
or no control or other this is not the

773
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,150
way to do things so once you have

774
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,770
started locking down your users once you

775
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,600
have started controlling the assets and

776
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,889
the applications are accessing these

777
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,409
hackers are going to get frustrated and

778
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,760
they're going to start going after api's

779
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,350
you start to have to have focusing on

780
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,990
that to make sure that things are going

781
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,040
according to plan

782
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,350
Twitter back in the day when they had

783
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,639
first rolled out their API it was really

784
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,050
interesting the a friend of my Robert

785
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,970
Hanssen he started going through and

786
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,440
adding all sorts of people on Twitter

787
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,300
and all of a sudden we were all

788
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,610
following him and were like wait how did

789
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,230
this happen we didn't even know so he

790
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,820
found undocumented features in the API

791
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,040
where he was able to arbitrarily and add

792
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,500
anybody he wanted and it was really

793
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,600
amazing that still that sort of thing

794
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,370
can happen with your API today if you

795
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,500
have undocumented features somebody

796
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:34,350
smarter than me is going to find them

797
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,910
and when we're dealing with that then we

798
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,760
have to extrapolate out and look at the

799
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:41,400
supply chain issues this is just one

800
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,230
example here this is a submarine cable

801
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,230
map for internet connections around the

802
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:47,310
world then you extrapolate out from

803
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,560
there all the different software

804
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,820
packages that you're using to build your

805
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,220
applications to build your

806
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,110
infrastructure each piece along the way

807
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,170
somebody has access to

808
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:00,540
how are you vetting the security of all

809
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,840
of those individual components how are

810
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:06,840
you making sure who has access to what

811
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,639
and the attackers are always looking for

812
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,959
new ways to get in because back in the

813
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,870
day they would just go after and attack

814
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,210
the site and my last job I was asked how

815
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,010
would i hack the company and I said

816
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:20,460
this was during my interview process and

817
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:23,190
I said simple I would take the CEOs exam

818
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,480
in out for lunch they said what would

819
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,530
that accomplish and I said well they

820
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,600
either talked her into giving my

821
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:30,990
password or I'd use a brick to her

822
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,730
fingers dark but this is how the

823
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,750
attackers think they're not going to

824
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,980
come at you with a frontal assault

825
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,350
anymore they're going to look for

826
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:42,600
another way around and the easier way to

827
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:43,649
get their job done I had a pen test done

828
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,350
years ago

829
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,210
not too many years ago actually oh my

830
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:51,090
god 11 years ago Wow

831
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,500
and I again this was one of those

832
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,540
moments where I came in the morning sat

833
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,680
down with my coffee and the phone rang

834
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,600
and they said we're ready to start

835
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:02,490
there's 9 a.m. it's like sure go for it

836
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,219
9-14 the phone rang I just stared at the

837
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:07,830
phone because I knew in my heart what

838
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,160
that was I didn't want to answer it but

839
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:14,639
I did and sure enough the pen test team

840
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:20,400
had gained access to every switch every

841
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:24,980
router the entire active directory they

842
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:28,050
had everything in 14 minutes

843
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,150
why because one of our third-party

844
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,610
connections coming into our network one

845
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:35,400
of our vendors that we worked with had

846
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:38,610
used default credentials on their access

847
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,020
point this was one of those things where

848
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,909
I didn't say the pen test you can only

849
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,730
attack between five and six on this day

850
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:48,690
and only these two servers I said no no

851
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:50,670
anything's fair game and I paid for that

852
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,840
or other dearly but I'm glad they did it

853
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,160
and not somebody else the best part was

854
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,810
they went through and they checked all

855
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,160
the logs and access files for everything

856
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:58,320
they had done and they could actually

857
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,020
find no evidence anybody else coming in

858
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,929
so that was a nice little moment no

859
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,580
assuming that the logs were in intact so

860
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,110
as we go through and we look back at all

861
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,460
the ports that were open in Sweden as an

862
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,179
example one of the things that I went

863
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,010
through and I went looked at was SSH so

864
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,990
this is just one sample that I went

865
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,640
through and I looked I said okay well

866
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,990
what kind of things is this particular

867
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,920
that's the safe daemon vulnerable to

868
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,920
this is one I just picked at random

869
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,690
that's a lot of vulnerabilities for one

870
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,430
Damon so somebody can gain access to

871
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,360
this system then pivot to other systems

872
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:35,670
is a pain can just go from there that's

873
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,330
a lot of SSH SSH Damon's that are

874
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,140
running out there in Sweden you want to

875
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,270
make sure that you're encrypting

876
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,410
everything in your network when you're

877
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,020
looking at this you want to look at

878
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:47,670
network traffic in-flight you want to

879
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,770
look at data at rest you want to make

880
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,180
sure that you're securing this I've seen

881
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,610
too many implementations and

882
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,430
organizations over the years where they

883
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,629
weren't encrypting the data one company

884
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,760
in particular was doing financial

885
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,140
transaction data like not actual a bank

886
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:07,410
but it was a company that was supplying

887
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:10,470
all sorts of date very cool that was a

888
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:12,300
new one and they were providing

889
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,010
financial data to us and they said oh

890
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,090
it's ok everything's over port 4 4 3 and

891
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,850
I looked I said but there's no

892
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,810
certificate I said oh no but the

893
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:22,350
requirements are were supposed to use

894
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:24,000
for 4 3 anything none of the data that

895
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,679
they were going across was actually in

896
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,240
fact encrypted but they were using the

897
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:33,210
port there's a better way to do things

898
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,630
we can move away from doing the static

899
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:39,390
usernames and passwords and this is a

900
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:40,590
great way for us to get there how many

901
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:46,670
people here by your show of hands have

902
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:49,290
heard of web authentic spected thank you

903
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:53,910
this is an open standard that was

904
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:55,710
recently ratified by w3c please go and

905
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,620
read this if you take nothing else away

906
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:01,530
from my talk today read this this is an

907
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,899
open standard this is not some vendor

908
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:05,610
saying buy our stuff this is an open

909
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,730
standard that will help you get to

910
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:11,460
password list authentication this is the

911
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:14,010
new hotness and I would really really

912
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,540
enjoy it if we can do better than the

913
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:20,550
static usernames and passwords that we

914
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:23,100
have done for far too long so let's do a

915
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:24,690
little wrap-up you want to assume that

916
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,330
your network is hostile everything on

917
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:29,820
your network is of some negative been if

918
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,409
you start there as your basis then

919
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,790
you've got a good place to go you want

920
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:34,020
to establish a trust engine you want to

921
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,759
make sure that you have your source of

922
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,320
truth for your users your devices

923
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,909
and the applications you're using and

924
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:45,399
write down do you want to keep it simple

925
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:47,889
I'm a big fan of repetition build your

926
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,080
asset inventory have solid grasp on your

927
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:53,139
user management you want to know what is

928
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,449
on your network defined repeatable

929
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:58,620
processes will help you in ways you

930
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,549
can't imagine concentrate on those

931
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,170
that's not something you have to buy

932
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,600
from anybody this is something you can

933
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:07,300
do yourselves and network zone

934
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,970
segmentation please please please do

935
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,640
this I worked in one organization which

936
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:15,040
I may have mentioned before where I was

937
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:19,180
in Toronto and I was able to query

938
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,730
offices in Southeast Asia and there was

939
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,680
no way for anything to be a problem no

940
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,200
no interactions that would stop me from

941
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,529
that it was a flat network global flat

942
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:33,160
network this is not something that needs

943
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:36,370
to be there so how did we get stuck with

944
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:39,910
passwords nears we configure back in

945
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:43,390
1962 MIT came out with passwords for a

946
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:46,390
system called CTS s now this was a time

947
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:48,009
management system to handle people's

948
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,580
access for supercomputing time each

949
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,870
student was allowed 4 hours per week

950
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,660
computing time in order to do their

951
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:57,609
projects but people figured out how they

952
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,620
could steal time from other students and

953
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:02,830
so they went okay a reactionary measure

954
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:05,440
was to put in passwords think about that

955
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:08,080
for a second 1962 a reactionary measure

956
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,910
was to put passwords and here we are

957
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,110
today

958
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,850
suffering data breaches of orders of

959
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:16,060
magnitude of billions of records because

960
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:19,230
of a reactionary knee-jerk response we

961
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,230
can do better than this

962
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:25,450
the old way of doing security is fading

963
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,640
away we need to be there to enable the

964
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:30,129
business an able our organizations and

965
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:33,549
naval our governments to do security in

966
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:36,490
a better way the old way is fading and

967
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:40,210
this is a good thing because we need to

968
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:42,100
improve how we do security we don't need

969
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,230
to be lobbing the Holy Hand Grenade of

970
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,710
Antioch every time something goes wrong

971
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:49,400
we don't need to be the group that is

972
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:53,270
saying how do we get to know

973
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,070
we're better than this thank you very

974
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,450
much for your time today

975
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,700
thank you very much the security fest

976
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:01,910
for having you back again I really

977
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,740
really do appreciate it and that is it

978
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:11,420

979
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:13,009
your mercy thank you

980
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,130
thank you very much Dave that was

981

amazing as always thank you we gonna

982
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,030
have yes but run around and see if we

983
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,069
have any questions in the audience so

984
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,660
please put your hands up if you do okay

985
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:25,970
I gotta ask I have a question yeah

986
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,730
what's that guy doing he's taking

987
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:34,359
amazing videos oh cool

988
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:34,360
you'll see them on Twitter oh thank you

989
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:44,300
this is in the cloud environment with a

990
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:46,730
container technology like kubernetes hmm

991
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,500
Jesper here has had a really good talk

992
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,510
with the difficulties with all the

993
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,870
applications that are involved and then

994
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:55,070
inherited vulnerabilities well yeah so

995
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,330
inherited vulnerabilities that is a

996
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,550
different animal so there you're looking

997
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,930
at dealing with the access control so

998
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,090
you're dealing with the users and the

999
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,799
access to the applications and I don't

1000
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,910
want to get too much into specifics

1001
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,050
because then it sounds like I'm ven

1002
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,910
during at you and I don't want to be

1003
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,260
doing that but I'm more than willing to

1004
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,029
have that conversation with you once I'm

1005
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,450
off the stage because I don't want to

1006
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:17,150
seem like that guy cool

1007
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:20,509
anyone else of course there is - all the

1008
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:23,440
way in the back is that the Spaniard hey

1009
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,440
Aria

1010
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,230
first of all thank for a really nice

1011
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:39,299
talk thank you and I want to ask you if

1012
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:42,510
I mean you have been coming up with a

1013
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:45,060
lot of things that can be done for

1014
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:47,400
example setting up web of n as a way to

1015
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:50,430
use biometrics and so and they have

1016
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,520
different Network segmentation and the

1017
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:57,529
question I have is suppose you just

1018
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,920
start at a new world new company you

1019
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:04,859
suddenly get into the role of size and

1020
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,859
you have to first one only one single

1021
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:10,319
thing if you could only give one advice

1022
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:13,970
because you only had one minute hmm

1023
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,619
which thing would you start focusing on

1024
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:23,399
for the first day for a Caesar

1025
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:24,780
yes wear Kevlar realistically I would

1026
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,640
say work with a start with an asset

1027
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,800
inventory if you don't know what's on

1028
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,509
your network how can you protect it I've

1029
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,010
been in far too many organizations over

1030
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,810
the years where we didn't have a firm

1031
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,820
understanding as to what the asset

1032
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:37,410
inventory was in one company we were

1033
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,730
rolling out a new version of antivirus

1034
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,960
across the board and they said ok we

1035
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,790
here's the inventory of everything we

1036
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,800
currently have once we started doing

1037
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,020
scans of the networked and checking all

1038
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,460
the assets to see what in fact was

1039
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,500
installed versus what we were told it

1040
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,470
wasn't so on the two did not even

1041
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,630
remotely lined up so it's one of those

1042
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,549
things if you have a solid core asset

1043
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,650
inventory from there then you start

1044
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,000
building out incremental wins you don't

1045
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:06,119
want to try to do everything at once you

1046
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:08,190
can't boil the ocean ok anyone else it's

1047
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,990

1048
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,400
