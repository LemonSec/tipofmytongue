1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
so I'm Sheila I've been to the Israeli

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,200
military for 13 years I was a major you

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,190
can see that little leaf on my shoulder

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,629
that's a major estanque so 13 years

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,210
there a couple of years ago I decided to

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,070
stop and think about what I want to do

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,230
with my life when I grow up and I

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,560
decided to check out what's going on

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,460
outside of the military so I joined a

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,879
cloud security company called dome 9

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:35,910
where I started doing detection of

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,430
malicious or suspicious events in the

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,459
public cloud and we were acquired by

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,620
checkpoint a few months ago yeah so

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,899
we're very very excited and other than

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:52,110
that I also volunteer in a wasp in the

17
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,960
board of the Israeli chapter of OS and

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,640
actually this Sunday starts the global

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,730
apps tech conference that we're hosting

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,210
in Tel Aviv this year so after I'm done

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,940
here

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,010
I'll be quickly heading back to Israel

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,990
to make sure everything is ready for our

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,729
conference and I also heard that

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,600
Guttenberg has a new OS chapter so way

26
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,908
to go and I wish you lots of good luck

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,500
and that's it let's start talking about

28
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:25,020
state-sponsored attacks so this reminds

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,400
me a lot of the Cold War actually what's

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:33,020
going on these days in the cyber domain

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,670
the G the digital world made warfare

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,429
completely different than what it used

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,740
to be if in the past when two countries

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,649
wanted to spy on one another they would

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,960
send over spies and it will be super

36
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,540
super complicated and also if the spy

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,339
gets detected so there will be sent to

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,250
jail for the rest of their lives

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,890
probably so technology made spying

40
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,189
fairly easy today today when you want to

41
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,159
tell a secret of another country you

42
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,829
just send over a spyware and there you

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,879
go you have your access and you get all

44
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:12,060
the information that you want but if

45
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,310
let's say back in the 60s Cold War was

46
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,209
between the

47
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:20,780
West and the USSR today we see this kind

48
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:23,569
of cold war between every two countries

49
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,430
they may appear as really really good

50
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:29,119
friends you see them the Prime

51
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,130
Minister's hugging together in the UN or

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,500
in international conferences but

53
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,400
actually they're spying on one another

54
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,470
all the time

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,650
for different reasons I'm going to talk

56
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,760
about these different reasons soon but

57
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:46,370
this is happening all the time and it's

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,260
undetectable and something I will keep

59
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,010
on repeating until the rest of my talk

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:55,069
is that the best cyber operation is the

61
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,739
one that you don't know about when a

62
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:00,018
country is running a cyber operation the

63
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:03,950
best result would be that the target

64
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:07,310
will never ever ever know that this

65
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:10,940
operation ever existed let alone who

66
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:15,230
made it so if in the past we had a dirty

67
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:18,230
bomb today we have a dirty warm and I

68
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,608
would like to talk about some aspects of

69
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,608
this new kind of warfare

70
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:44,450
can I have a little hand here please so

71
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,820
I will just speak out of my memory she

72
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,500
looks like come up so the first

73
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,320
challenge that we have today is the

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,910
detection challenge so if in traditional

75
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:58,940
warfare we have radar that can tell that

76
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:03,350
an enemy's aircraft is coming your way

77
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:07,760
or we can actually see a sea vessel

78
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:08,959
coming your way in the cyber world yeah

79
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,200
thanks

80
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:17,470
it's working now the clicker is not

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,469
working okay so you can just stand here

82
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:28,479
no go back go back

83
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:32,000
spoilers works thanks but stay here so

84
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,580
so if so if in the cyber world in

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,310
detection we have a firewall or an

86
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,740
antivirus as I said before yeah these

87
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,479
products are fine but when a country

88
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,750
wants to attack another country

89
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:48,530
these tools are meaningless because we

90
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:51,380
have lots of other ways to bypass them

91
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:55,460
this is just nice to have when you're

92
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:59,719
not a security aware enough like your

93
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,539
security well aware like okay but we can

94
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,000
definitely bypass these detection

95
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:08,780
barriers and they don't pose a big

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,450
threat to countries damage an impact so

97
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,210
when we're talking about the old world

98
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,849
damage and impact could have been a big

99
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,580
explosion it was more of a kinetic

100
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,700
damage and in the cyber warfare our

101
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,130
damage might be something that will

102
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:28,640
never actually happen it can be just

103
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:31,669
tapping and getting very high sensitive

104
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,000
emails so this is not a damage you can

105
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:39,530
actually see a damage can be mind

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,870
manipulating and making people vote in a

107
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,169
certain way this is also not

108
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,230
genetic damage it's not an explosion

109
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:51,230
another type of damage can be corruption

110
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,970
of data again not an explosion and

111
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:57,740
something you can definitely deny that

112
00:05:52,970 --> 00:06:00,830
you ever did preparing and defense it's

113
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,680
really hard to defend yourself against a

114
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,690
country that wants to attack you in the

115
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,040
cyber domain you can try really really

116
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:14,690
hard but the best defense in this world

117
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:17,630
is the offense because as I said before

118
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,430
the fire world's firewalls and the anti

119
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,719
viruses are not going to be good enough

120
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,130
so if you want to know if someone is

121
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,860
going to attack you the best thing to do

122
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:28,870
would to hack them and to check out what

123
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:32,750
their plans are the psychological effect

124
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,550
again if in the past the the effect was

125
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,290
an explosion and everyone would freak

126
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,390
out but you know you have a military so

127
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,820
if one country attacks you you know you

128
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,880
can always attack back when there is a

129
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,620
cyber attack and you don't know who did

130
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,810
it and you are not even sure it's a

131
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,570
cyber attack people are going to get

132
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,000
scared they no longer trust their

133
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,700
government they don't know what's going

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:01,480
to happen tomorrow today their bank

135
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:04,010
account was deleted or they have zero

136
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,050
money there what's gonna happen tomorrow

137
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:09,349
will I have electricity will I have

138
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:11,930
internet will airplanes crash down I

139
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:15,380
don't know people get really freaked out

140
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,060
and this is exactly what hackers want

141
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,909
them to feel they want them to feel

142
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,240
afraid

143
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:27,380
attribution always a challenge because

144
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:30,860
you can always deny it you can always IP

145
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,000
spoof and say and make sure it's going

146
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,640
to look like it came from a whole

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,550
different place fortunately there are a

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,349
lot of tools that are running out there

149
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,570
on the internet so you can use another

150
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,750
companies too and other countries tools

151
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,760
and say that they did it or you have no

152
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:51,680
idea who did it or just deny or just

153
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:54,949
ignore so attribution is

154
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,669
something that is fairly hard to do when

155
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:01,729
talking about state-sponsored attacks

156
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:04,008
now I want you to try and change the

157
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:06,979
perspective of your thoughts right now

158
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:11,690
because many of you probably had a

159
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:14,270
chance to get the feel from criminal

160
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,520
hackers maybe some of you were hackers

161
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,990
in the past that's fine I don't judge

162
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:23,090
and maybe some of you are defending

163
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:26,600
against hackers but you have the state

164
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:29,630
of mind of a criminal hacker and the

165
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,060
state hacker has a completely different

166
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,849
state of mind and what I want to do

167
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:38,359
today is kinda give you a different

168
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:41,180
perspective I want you to maybe put on a

169
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,969
new black hoodie and imagine that you're

170
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:47,630
a state-sponsored hacker just for today

171
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,029
and think about how you would do things

172
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:54,170
differently the next time you want to

173
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:57,970
hack somewhere or something so this is

174
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:01,250
what we're going to do today concentrate

175
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:03,500
what would be the goals of a criminal

176
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:07,820
hacker so first of all we have the you

177
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:11,120
know the financial goals or money or its

178
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:14,800
equivalent like data private data is an

179
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,820
equivalent to money because you sell it

180
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,160
money can also be of course

181
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:24,650
cryptocurrency we saw a lot of hacks on

182
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,709
exchange markets and on banks because

183
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:30,110
hacker just wanted money so this is they

184
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:32,180
just went to the source of the money and

185
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,870
again they want to get to get data

186
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,939
because they can impersonate someone

187
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,300
else they can hack into their bank

188
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,760
account they can sell their private data

189
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:47,209
they can extort uber and make them look

190
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,430
like it's a bug bounty so data is great

191
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:50,779
and it's definitely money equivalent and

192
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,380
I'll think that criminal hacker

193
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:57,380
sometimes wants to do is get awareness

194
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,860
to some kind of idea so they also you

195
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,320
know do DDoS attacks or defacement not

196
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,360
really cool but these are all let's say

197
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,610
traditional criminal hacker

198
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,029
kind of things and what they want to

199
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,439
achieve now the state-sponsored hackers

200
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:17,209
usually want to achieve whole different

201
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:20,389
things first of all is destruction and

202
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:22,248
chaos so we just talked about it what

203
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:25,819
they want to achieve is not more money

204
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:28,429
they want the citizens or the government

205
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:30,920
of another company to feel very much

206
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:33,290
afraid about something and to make them

207
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,219
do whatever they want or not do

208
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:38,629
something else

209
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:41,869
but they want fear they also want to

210
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:44,360
know your secrets for different kinds of

211
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:45,860
reasons some sometimes you know to

212
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,529
countries that are at peace with one

213
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,649
another just want to understand how

214
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:54,949
other countries think and what are your

215
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,509
their interests so that if sometimes in

216
00:10:54,949 --> 00:11:00,258
the future we will have to negotiate

217
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:02,239
some financial agreement or reach some

218
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:04,699
kind of understanding we will know how

219
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:06,980
they think we will know what pain points

220
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:11,660
are and we will have a leverage in the

221
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:13,720
negotiation another thing state hackers

222
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,449
want to do is to deliver a message

223
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:21,529
stay away don't do that don't meddle

224
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:23,179
with us this industry we control it so

225
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:27,339
please stay away and do something else

226
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:27,339
so this is a way of delivering a message

227
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:34,040
financial advantage in financial

228
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:37,639
advantage I'm talking about breaking

229
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:41,329
into private companies or governmental

230
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,579
companies and getting their IP because

231
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:47,290
you want to manufacture the same product

232
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:50,929
but more cheaply or to take over that

233
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,929
technology and manufacture something for

234
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:56,660
yourself for example Israel has a recipe

235
00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:00,499
for Chery tomatoes you know the tiny

236
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:04,850
little sweet tomatoes we had an we have

237
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:07,339
an agriculture research kind of

238
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:11,079
University thingy and the Chinese just

239
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:15,169
hack there and got the the secret recipe

240
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:17,029
as to how to grow these little really

241
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,079
sweet tomatoes and now they're growing

242
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:22,879
them

243
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:25,239
so just an example and an easter egg you

244
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,910
can break into somewhere really really

245
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,189
secret but not to ruin anything not to

246
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,259
steal anything you just live an easter

247
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:35,599
egg because if that country is going to

248
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:39,500
piss you off someday you're going to use

249
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,560
that Easter egg break into those servers

250
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,540
and maybe cause the destruction at that

251
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,050
point so just live a little surprise

252
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,819
there

253
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:54,139
and use it whenever you find right so we

254
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:57,259
talked about detectable impact and an

255
00:12:54,139 --> 00:13:01,250
impact that might never get detected the

256
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:03,740
easter egg might never explode now let's

257
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:07,220
talk about tools and resources that

258
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,110
criminal hackers has versus the

259
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,939
state-sponsored hackers now I have to

260
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,329
say that sometimes there is a very very

261
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:17,269
thin line between the two sometimes the

262
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:21,649
line doesn't even exist and the best

263
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:24,110
example for that would be hacking in

264
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:27,769
Russia because the Russian authorities

265
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,959
tell hackers unofficially of course you

266
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:34,399
can do whatever you want as long as

267
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:37,638
you're not hurting Russian citizens so

268
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:41,500
hackers go ahead and find zero days and

269
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:45,100
write exploits and Trojans and have

270
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:48,079
botnets and they do whatever they want

271
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,199
but then someday sometime

272
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,689
a Russian governmental can knock on your

273
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,839
door and say hi we know what you're

274
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:59,329
doing it's okay we just want you to take

275
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,939
this little piece of code and put it in

276
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:03,199
your malware if you want your head to

277
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:06,800
remain attached to your body

278
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,589
and and that's it and then everyone is

279
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,319
happy the hacker keeps on you know doing

280
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:15,730
their ransomware thing getting money and

281
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:18,199
Russian government now has access to

282
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,970
infrastructure to malware they can use

283
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,889
and then of course deny that they ever

284
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,509
did it because it's just criminals and

285
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,550
not state-sponsored hackers

286
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,920
so there is a very very thin line and

287
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,599
very often countries use criminal

288
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,569
hackers for their own purposes but let

289
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,569
talk about the resources so the criminal

290
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:38,579
hackers have a lot of you know

291
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:41,130
open-source tools and tools that were

292
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,508
used in the past and surprisingly enough

293
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,490
it's still working

294
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:48,480
it's there working because people make

295
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:51,600
mistakes and they don't patch and we

296
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,269
rely on that we rely on people not being

297
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,310
security aware enough there are the

298
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,110
known exploits that are not patched and

299
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:01,500
you have the script kiddies and the

300
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:04,709
black gray hat people who will use those

301
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,740
tools to get whatever it is that the

302
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,540
criminal hacking group wanted to get on

303
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,790
the other hand we have the

304
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,819
state-sponsored hackers and they have

305
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,759
completely different resources first of

306
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:21,689
all they have all the engineers and the

307
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,970
academics they want who can run research

308
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,769
for them and get all the zero-days they

309
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:29,569
ever want so if you want to get access

310
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:31,949
to anywhere and that place is using

311
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:34,680
Windows and you say oh my god I have to

312
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:36,779
get away to get in there so just tell

313
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,750
your engineers you have to get in there

314
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:42,839
and they will have to dig in and find a

315
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:46,649
zero-day for you to use

316
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:50,839
you have limitless access to technology

317
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:53,339
if it's in the academia and sometimes

318
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,480
companies are helping their governments

319
00:15:53,339 --> 00:16:00,630
to get access in the past it was said

320
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,199
that there are backdoors in Cisco

321
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:06,899
equipment for the US government I don't

322
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:11,008
know if this is true but some people say

323
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:13,170
it's true financial resources

324
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:16,910
unlike the criminal hacker that have to

325
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:19,680
be cost effective the countries can give

326
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,740
endless resources financial resources oh

327
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,040
you need a new computer use 10 computers

328
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,899
oh you need access to I don't know you

329
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,250
need really really strong AWS resources

330
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:34,620
here do what everyone so the criminal

331
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,959
hackers can't get everything they want

332
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,839
and we're going to talk about hardware

333
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,939
hacking soon hardware hacking is way

334
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,290
more expensive than software hacking and

335
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:49,360
yeah you can do that also if you want

336
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:53,020
international support countries help one

337
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,730
another to hack how because maybe I have

338
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,470
a zero-day that you need to get

339
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,630
somewhere else that you want so they

340
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,600
definitely help one another they

341
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,030
sometimes give the intelligence the

342
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,150
other country needs to complete their

343
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,399
operation and there is usually you know

344
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:12,880
a give-and-take kind of thing you owe me

345
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,100
I owe you and we'll make it happen so

346
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,079
it's okay and countries help one another

347
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:24,159
all the time and it's kind of a power

348
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:26,379
multiplier methods of attacking so if

349
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,170
the criminal hackers are kind of

350
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:32,410
spraying their their malware or their

351
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:37,870
fishing campaigns around distributing

352
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:41,470
and you know trying to be as efficient

353
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:45,429
as possible the countries work

354
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:47,380
completely different differently first

355
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,460
of all they have to decide what the

356
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,010
target is

357
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,560
they're not just spraying their malware

358
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:56,080
around they have to be very very very

359
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:59,770
specific at what they want to get I want

360
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,990
access to this place because this is the

361
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,570
information that I am missing you can't

362
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,940
because you have a lot of resources it

363
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,310
can get a little confusing but you have

364
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,950
to plan ahead

365
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:14,320
another thing is go low and slow you

366
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,570
want to get undetected and you're not in

367
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,580
a hurry you're not in a hurry to get it

368
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,340
done tomorrow I can get it down in one

369
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,770
month or in one year as long as I don't

370
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:27,639
get detected and I get access to

371
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:32,190
wherever it is that I want the attacks

372
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:36,130
are very very very well crafted it's not

373
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:38,590
the general phishing attack that will

374
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,090
you know someone will just open a file

375
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,699
and that's it you're done no they're

376
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:46,300
super well crafted to the destination

377
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:49,450
where you want to be at we're not

378
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,600
limited to digital vectors if you need

379
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:55,750
to send over a person to talk to someone

380
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,810
else or to get your physical access or

381
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,260
to get you a thumb drive and connect it

382
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:05,200
somewhere yeah you can do that

383
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:09,129
definitely and always always always

384
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,160
always leave a backdoor for future use

385
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:15,790
if I don't know if your target updates

386
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,310
their operating system or even if right

387
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,440
now you have no need for that access but

388
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:26,100
maybe in the future you will you always

389
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:28,570
have to get reinfection capabilities and

390
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,060
I'm sure you you're probably well aware

391
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:34,179
of all of these the countries and many

392
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,159
other countries that are super active in

393
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,340
the cyber domain I've mentioned the

394
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,070
Russians before the Russians are

395
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,050
meddling pretty much everywhere we

396
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,689
talked about the thin line between the

397
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,960
criminal hackers and the state-sponsored

398
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:55,390
hackers and another interesting thing in

399
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:59,710
Russia is the healthy competition

400
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:03,100
between their intelligence agencies so

401
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:06,580
we mainly see the FSB and the GRU

402
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:09,969
kind of competing one another so when

403
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,220
putting decides he wants to get certain

404
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,920
information we see both of these

405
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,130
agencies running around and trying to

406
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,620
infect that destination and at the end

407
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,380
of the day you might see malware from

408
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,100
the FSB and the GRU living together on

409
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:30,640
the same computer which can interfere

410
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,740
one another the Chinese which I also

411
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:38,350
mentioned before are very very very

412
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:43,570
active in the in the financial espionage

413
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:45,669
and for that they built a lot of cheap

414
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,919
hacking tools because they are not

415
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,140
afraid of if one of these tools gets

416
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,240
detected they're just gonna throw it

417
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,610
away and use another one of the tools

418
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,610
that they're making so they don't care

419
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:00,399
if it gets detected it's very very cheap

420
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,770
for them and like other countries they

421
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:07,600
do whatever they want and they're not

422
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:09,550
really a shame of that so we talked

423
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,409
about the

424
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:14,139
perspective between the criminal hacker

425
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:18,190
and the state-sponsored hacker and how

426
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:21,220
each one of them works so now I want all

427
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:24,210
of you to close your eyes and think if

428
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:28,270
you had all the resources in the world

429
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,190
all the money all the engineers access

430
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,730
to everywhere you want and you had to

431
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:36,820
craft the best hack that will get you

432
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:40,300
access to all the information you could

433
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:43,419
ever dream of and go undetected how

434
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,600
would you do it just think about it for

435
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,600
a minute

436
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:53,260
and I have one possible answer for you

437
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:57,010
someone did such an amazing work for us

438
00:21:53,260 --> 00:22:01,090
it is the best supply chain attack

439
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:04,629
vector that I know of maybe there are

440
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:08,709
others that I don't know about but I'm

441
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:11,710
talking about the chips in the Chinese

442
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,690
hardware now I know what you're going to

443
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,760
tell me are you serious this was

444
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,760
published in Bloomberg this is not

445
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,750
exactly you know the best intelligence

446
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,640
source in the world and you're right

447
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,890
it's not it's just a newspaper and I

448
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,590
always ask myself what is the interest

449
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,630
behind publishing such a thing so

450
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,330
blomberg belongs to Michael Bloomberg

451
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,400
and maybe he hates Trump so maybe wanted

452
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:40,169
to embarrass him I don't know there can

453
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:45,429
be like so much different interests

454
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,740
behind publishing such an article but

455
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:49,809
having said that a lot of other weird

456
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:53,380
stuff had happened around the publishing

457
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:55,270
of this of this article back in 2018 and

458
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,910
another thing I have to share with you

459
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:01,420
is if we talked before about the problem

460
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:04,330
of attribution of attacks very often

461
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,059
countries don't even want to publicly

462
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:09,460
blame someone else for what happened for

463
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:11,770
different reasons first of all sometimes

464
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,500
they don't want to let the hackers know

465
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,750
that we know that they know that we know

466
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,750
that they know so they're not doing

467
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,890
anything about it

468
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,440
another thing is that again for

469
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,570
political reasons

470
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,419
sometimes countries don't want to blame

471
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:30,899
one another in public so what do they do

472
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:33,840
they use the media and they let they

473
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:36,719
give a journalist information go and

474
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,879
investigate this and then they published

475
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,639
an article that the source for the

476
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:44,340
article was actually a little piece of

477
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:46,678
real intelligence information from the

478
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,559
government so these things happen all

479
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,350
the time and this is why when I read the

480
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,220
paper I always ask myself what was the

481
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:57,389
interest behind this kind of article and

482
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,460
I'm not sure what was the interest

483
00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:04,428
behind this article specifically but

484
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:08,429
what I do know is that 28 very very big

485
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:11,399
American companies were using the

486
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:13,799
motherboards that the company involved

487
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:15,959
which I will elaborate about in a minute

488
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,809
was manufacturing including Apple

489
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,629
including Amazon AWS and a lot of other

490
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:24,059
companies and at the beginning all the

491
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:25,289
companies obviously denied because what

492
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,629
else are they going to do or they're

493
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:31,379
going to admit and then I'd know pay

494
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:33,719
huge GDP are fines or other fines to

495
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:36,509
their users of course they're not going

496
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,519
to admit that this happened but in

497
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:41,669
American culture it's very very popular

498
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,740
to sue one another all the time and in

499
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:47,190
this case these big companies did not

500
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:51,480
sue Bloomberg for this publication so I

501
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:54,779
asked myself why didn't they sue but

502
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,679
what exactly happened here back in 2015

503
00:24:54,779 --> 00:25:01,519
a Amazon wanted to buy a motherboard

504
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,710
company or a server company called

505
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:09,379
elemental technologies elemental was an

506
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:12,659
American company that had their servers

507
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:16,519
assembled by at the time the world

508
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:19,169
largest motherboard company Super Micro

509
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:20,669
Super Micro was manufacturing their

510
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:24,360
motherboards like many other companies

511
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:27,509
in China and as a part of the due

512
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,429
diligence AWS sent some of the servers

513
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:35,140
to be checked with the third day

514
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:37,750
Tyr have heard the company and that

515
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,120
company found little chips on the

516
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,520
motherboards they just didn't understand

517
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,270
why were they there and what were they

518
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,270
doing there

519
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:49,450
so this is one the investigation back

520
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:52,150
began back in 2015 so we don't know

521
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:57,040
exactly when did those little chips were

522
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:59,200
put on the motherboards but Amazon of

523
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,990
course reported this to the American

524
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,240
government and they started their own

525
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:07,780
investigation it was pretty scary

526
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,670
because these motherboards were also

527
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:14,350
used by the FBI and the DoD so a lot of

528
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:17,830
you know sensitive organizations were

529
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:21,459
using these servers from the check that

530
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:24,610
was conducted these microchips were able

531
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:29,170
to do two things one was communicating

532
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:32,620
with the C&C server and get code updates

533
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:35,050
and the other was when the code update

534
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,600
arrived was to push it into the

535
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:41,530
motherboard and I mentioned before these

536
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,459
hacks are make they make look software

537
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:46,810
hacks look really really really simple

538
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,540
because I don't know when was the last

539
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:52,690
time that you designed a new chip it

540
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:56,110
takes a lot of time it takes a lot of

541
00:26:52,690 --> 00:27:00,490
money you have to make it super tiny so

542
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:03,790
it will go undetected and it's not only

543
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,200
one chip several different chips were

544
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,480
found according to the different

545
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,920
motherboard so every mother bird had its

546
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,650
own spying

547
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,660
chip a unique chip on it so it's

548
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:17,800
actually developing different kinds of

549
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:23,320
chips so this attack was very very very

550
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:26,350
complicated R&D wise and how exactly did

551
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,439
it happen so the Chinese had to create

552
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:32,320
those chips and build them plant them in

553
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,260
the motherboards ship the motherboards

554
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,610
and make sure they are installed in the

555
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:41,160
interesting place where you want to be

556
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:43,840
at have connection with CNC servers and

557
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,690
get back all the information that you

558
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,330
want and I'm not even talking about the

559
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,850
crazy scenario where you manipulate with

560
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,779
the information I'm just talking about

561
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:56,110
getting the information that you want

562
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:58,390
from the chip I recently met the hard

563
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:00,850
work hard word hacker that was

564
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,620
interviewed in the Bloomberg article and

565
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,840
he said that yes it is it's also

566
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:10,178
possible to manipulate with the data and

567
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:11,949
not not only get it and another very

568
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,500
very interesting thing that happened

569
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:17,500
here is the intelligence work that was

570
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,240
done by the Chinese because we're

571
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,370
starting to talk about we started

572
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,720
talking about elemental which was you

573
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:27,279
know where it all began

574
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,710
elemental had their servers brought

575
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,020
together by super micro which

576
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:35,500
manufactures their motherboards in

577
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:39,970
Taiwan and China and in China they have

578
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:42,190
four subcontractors so you need to get

579
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,510
to the subcontractors and according to

580
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:48,370
some reports the the factories managers

581
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,980
had people approach to them sometimes

582
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:53,080
they said that they're from Super Micro

583
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,970
and sometimes they just said that

584
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,850
they're you know government officials

585
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:02,190
and they offer to offer the bribe to

586
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:04,990
change the design of the chip and if the

587
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,669
factory manager refused they just

588
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,279
threatened they would close the factory

589
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:12,399
and this is how they managed to get in

590
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,950
they had to do some a lot some some

591
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,289
serious intelligence work to find the

592
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,330
relevant factories where the relevant

593
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:22,299
motherboards are being manufactured

594
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:24,279
where these specific motherboards will

595
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:27,520
get to the interesting companies that

596
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:30,190
the Chinese wanted to get access to so

597
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:35,020
this was a lot of intelligence work on

598
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:37,950
top of the R&D work so bottom line very

599
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:40,750
very very beautiful hardware hack

600
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,480
hardware is very often off the radar

601
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,990
most of the security measurements that

602
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,960
we use our software and they will never

603
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:54,340
detect a good Hardware hack so this was

604
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,409
very nice it's also nice to use the fact

605
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,429
that if everyone manufacturers in China

606
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:59,860
then China

607
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:03,210
China is the right place to plant the

608
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:07,270
chip in and not to get to the Amazon

609
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:10,120
server storage and go there and implant

610
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:13,150
it over there it's a great foot at the

611
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:16,780
door you can get anywhere you want you

612
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:19,870
can get data from I don't know a third

613
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:24,070
kind a company that uses a double us

614
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:26,020
because that server has the chip so I'm

615
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,189
guessing that the Chinese got access to

616
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,710
data

617
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,809
they didn't even dream to get so that

618
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:35,920
was a very very very interesting

619
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:37,809
operation now the great thing is that

620
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,960
this is this specific slide

621
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:45,250
I prepared a couple of months ago and

622
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,830
the reality kind of you know writes my

623
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,550
slide for me okay because I used to talk

624
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:53,710
about the fact that back in 2015 when

625
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:56,620
when this article was published sorry

626
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:00,220
when the article was published in 2018

627
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:03,010
but it was said that the chips were

628
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:06,059
found in 2015 in 2015 Barack Obama

629
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:11,020
President Obama signed an agreement with

630
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:13,840
the Chinese President to not do

631
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:16,690
financial espionage on one another in

632
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,330
the cyber domain and the Chinese agreed

633
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,250
to sign this why would they agree to do

634
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,399
this they are always doing this

635
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,470
financial espionage in the u.s. maybe

636
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,860
one of the reasons they agreed was

637
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:32,740
before was because they knew they have

638
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,830
an alternative method the Americans are

639
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,900
not going to get so they agreed to sign

640
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,600
the agreement and then you know I can

641
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,940
talk about how the Americans are not

642
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,939
recommending to use Huawei but

643
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:49,210
fortunately enough we have some news

644
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,230
about this from you know recent from

645
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,460
recent weeks

646
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:56,530
Trump is banning to use Huawei and then

647
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,140
other companies are not allowed to sell

648
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,970
them chips and then you know other

649
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:05,160
companies are saying that they know that

650
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:08,950
there are backdoors in their products so

651
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,460
again is this a trade war between China

652
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,820
and the US or

653
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,530
this real cold war between the two

654
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:19,040
countries

655
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:20,930
I'm guessing both are right but both

656
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:25,840
countries are fighting one another and

657
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:29,750
this is one way of fighting manipulating

658
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,970
Hardware manipulating cellphones and

659
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,850
routers that are very very popular in

660
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,260
the US and now the reality is going to

661
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,679
change I'm not sure how exactly it's

662
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,670
going to change but it will change and I

663
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,710
don't know what is going to happen

664
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,750
exactly to power maybe they're going to

665
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,090
build their own chips and then sell

666
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:51,920
their products to other companies to

667
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:54,980
other countries so to sum up what we saw

668
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:58,340
here we saw an easter egg to be used

669
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:01,640
some time we saw a country that wants to

670
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:05,030
know all of your secrets with financial

671
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:08,270
trade or trade advantages with limitless

672
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:10,100
access to technology we saw a lot of

673
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:14,510
engineering and a lot of financial

674
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:17,379
resources and we saw an attack that was

675
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:22,160
very well-crafted went low and slow and

676
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:25,450
left a backdoor and I am Not sure they

677
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:29,660
did not use humans behind it

678
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:34,450
why are you here okay am i running out

679
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,450
of time okay thanks

680
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:44,450
moving on to another incident who turned

681
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:50,000
out the lights this is the first the

682
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:52,160
first power outage caused by cyberattack

683
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,510
again that we know of

684
00:33:52,160 --> 00:34:02,600
it happened in Ukraine allegedly by

685
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:06,320
Russia I don't know a lot about Russian

686
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:10,130
and Ukrainian politics I just know that

687
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:13,520
it looks like Ukraine is the playground

688
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:16,190
of Russia for cyber tools I don't know

689
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:21,170
exactly why I understand they have their

690
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:23,960
issues then I don't judge but yeah

691
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:27,110
electricity in Ukraine

692
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:30,590
one day December 2015

693
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:32,840
December 23rd 5 p.m. people are going

694
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:35,840
back home and about a quarter million

695
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:39,950
people had no electricity for three to

696
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:43,899
six hours how did that exactly happen

697
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:47,120
well that area has three different

698
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:49,969
electricity companies that have three

699
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,668
different distribution stations and they

700
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:54,399
each have their own substations so we're

701
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:57,440
talking about a few dozens of

702
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:03,529
substations that are all of a sudden not

703
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:07,970
working this is not just script kiddies

704
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:10,730
work because to make an electricity grid

705
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,259
to stop working you need some serious

706
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,450
work around it

707
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,970
you need a hacker that actually knows

708
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:19,339
their way around and my guess would be

709
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:23,720
that the Russians actually actually

710
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:27,080
brought in some SCADA experts to operate

711
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:30,410
this I don't think that their regular

712
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,319
hackers did such a thing and another

713
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:36,370
thing is that I don't believe in luck I

714
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:40,250
don't think that this well orchestrated

715
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:42,410
attack could have happened randomly so

716
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,930
you needed a bunch of people to

717
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:47,390
orchestrate it very very very well to

718
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:50,210
make sure that the power outage happens

719
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:54,259
together at the same time for all

720
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:56,930
stations so again this is not a criminal

721
00:35:54,260 --> 00:36:01,070
hackers work work this is a country's

722
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:05,060
very very very serious work around ICS

723
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:07,610
and around SCADA and how such a thing

724
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,529
could have happened I'm going to talk

725
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,840
about what happened on the way to the

726
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:18,440
target and what happened at the target

727
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:20,810
so the way to the target you've probably

728
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,810
heard about this attack vectors before

729
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,610
it starts with a spear fishing and then

730
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,680
you find your way around and you get

731
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,080
your credentials and you're very very

732
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:36,779
happy but engaged in this case work

733
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:44,009
again we saw spear fishing with you know

734
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:45,390
office documents with macro files this

735
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,880
is again something that we know of

736
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:51,200
people use it all the time but in this

737
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:55,500
case the research actually showed that

738
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:58,649
the the infected payload was sent by

739
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,960
legitimate users who actually intended

740
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:04,140
to send those files these were not

741
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,370
malicious people who sent the files so

742
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,520
the Russians actually got to the

743
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:11,279
computers of the sender's and infected

744
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,800
their files and then the files were sent

745
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,530
and the sender's did had no idea

746
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,260
they're sending payload to their friends

747
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:21,810
in the electricity company people in the

748
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:26,280
electricity company opened the files get

749
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:29,400
infected with a black energy and other

750
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,670
Russian tools the Russians are wandering

751
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,340
around harvesting credentials great work

752
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:38,280
this is what I would do as well if I had

753
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:40,140
to harvesting the credentials but then

754
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,920
you have to hop from the management

755
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,930
network to the SCADA Network and it's

756
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,650
very very important to do network

757
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:52,560
segmentations like the Ukrainians did

758
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:57,540
but the Ukrainians enabled connection

759
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,340
with RDP and did not require MFA so if

760
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,090
you have the credentials you can just

761
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:06,390
hop to the next network it's not that

762
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:09,720
hard so here we are and now the Russians

763
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:11,940
have access to discard the network and

764
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,430
what did they do when they got to the

765
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,520
target so first of all they wanted to

766
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,669
get the power down so they did their

767
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,700
research and they understood how this

768
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:25,680
power grid operates and they understood

769
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,080
that in order to cause the power outage

770
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,839
they have to open the breakers of the

771
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,870
electricity grid and this is exactly

772
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:36,540
what they did and they wanted to make a

773
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:39,779
little more chaos and a little more of a

774
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:42,960
hard time to the IT engineers to restore

775
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:46,200
the electricity so the next thing they

776
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,450
did was to delete the firmware and to

777
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,129
install their own firmware on the

778
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,680
computer

779
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:54,380
so that again the engineers will not be

780
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,960
able to connect remotely and modify the

781
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:00,109
computers back they also installed the

782
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,170
kill disk that actually deletes reboot

783
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:08,089
files and then again the engineers

784
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:11,720
couldn't restore their grip on the end

785
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:13,490
point computers so a lot of chaos and

786
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,500
now to restore electricity you have to

787
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:19,279
send engineers to each and every station

788
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:23,480
and if that wasn't enough we saw a

789
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:25,869
little bonus hack the Russians did not

790
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,900
settle for what they did and they also

791
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:34,160
did a DDoS attack on the phone operators

792
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:37,130
of the of the electricity companies and

793
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,920
when the angry customers called and

794
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:42,710
asked hey why is the power down no one

795
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,630
answered them because there are a lot of

796
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:50,950
fake calls calling in to those operators

797
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:56,000
so this was what the Russians did to the

798
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:58,970
Ukraine and such a hack to me could mean

799
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,480
two things one is to deliver a message

800
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:05,629
to the Ukrainians telling them listen

801
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,579
where the bus here okay because we know

802
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:11,779
that they've had their problems before

803
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:13,759
with crime area and you know other other

804
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:15,859
things that they have issues about so

805
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:18,829
this is their way of telling weird weird

806
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:20,630
the sheriff in town or delivering a

807
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:23,630
message to other countries telling them

808
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,210
did you see what happened in Ukraine if

809
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,759
you don't want this to happen to you

810
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:33,410
you'd better behave another kind of

811
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:35,119
message I have a short video here that I

812
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:37,069
don't want to show you because this is

813
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,450
not my computer and I'm afraid that if I

814
00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:41,180
will show it I will not be able to get

815
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:43,220
back to the presentation but this is a

816
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:47,299
video from YouTube and you can watch it

817
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:50,359
yourselves this is a video that one of

818
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:52,160
the Ukrainians Ukrainian engineers in

819
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:54,230
the electricity grid it's just he opened

820
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,629
their phone and just showing how he's

821
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:59,779
not touching the computer but you can

822
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:02,450
see the mouse cursor moving around and

823
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:02,720
actually doing the process it takes you

824
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:06,200
know

825
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,328
to stop the breakers and to stop the

826
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,490
electricity from running properly and

827
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:13,010
he's just saying hey are you seeing this

828
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:16,520
is I'm not moving the mouse it's moving

829
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:19,849
all by itself so it's really funny to

830
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:24,170
see and you can watch it yourselves

831
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:25,700
later so another great applause for the

832
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:26,960
Russians for a beautiful beautiful

833
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,480
attack

834
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,510
it was super well synchronized and I

835
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,880
think that this is except for the

836
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:37,700
technology challenge this is a serious

837
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,670
management challenge I don't know how

838
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:44,618
many people do you manage in your work

839
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:49,250
but managing such an operation is the

840
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:51,470
work of art you need to understand the

841
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,930
target the Russians did a very good job

842
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:58,730
understanding how to send a good fishing

843
00:41:53,930 --> 00:42:00,410
and also how to operate the ICS and as I

844
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:03,829
said before I'm sure they brought their

845
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:06,348
experts to do that and last thing is the

846
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:09,109
after-effects and a great example for

847
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:12,170
the after-effects is again from a couple

848
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:14,210
of months ago if you remember there were

849
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,640
in Venezuela there under crisis right

850
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:19,190
now and at some point they had problem

851
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,400
with the electricity and they blamed

852
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:25,010
America for that now did the Americans

853
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,359
actually manipulated with the

854
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:30,200
electricity in Venezuela

855
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:33,500
I don't know but even the fact that such

856
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,169
a question is asked means that the

857
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:39,589
Russian got a psychological effect on us

858
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:42,410
now when we don't have electricity when

859
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:45,349
our phones are down when there is a

860
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:48,828
problem with traffic lights I always ask

861
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:51,109
myself is this really just a little

862
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:54,380
technical problem or is someone

863
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:56,359
delivering us a message I always ask

864
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,060
myself such questions and this was from

865
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:01,578
my way to one of the talks I stopped in

866
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,430
a lounge and what do I see is Russia

867
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:07,970
meddling in upcoming Ukrainian elections

868
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,680
on CNN I don't know but we keep on

869
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,509
asking these questions because we are

870
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,819
afraid that someone is meddling with

871
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,950
elections someone is meddling with our

872
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:18,910
minds

873
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:21,040
and we are afraid that what we think is

874
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:23,529
our free choice is not really our free

875
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,130
choice and some someone actually walked

876
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:31,540
us into doing something we maybe didn't

877
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:33,190
intend to now before I finish when I

878
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,049
deliver this talk people always tell me

879
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:38,799
you're from Israel why aren't you

880
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:39,430
talking about Israel and before you ask

881
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:43,119
me that

882
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:45,848
here is a my comment to you on that

883
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:50,910
first of all Israel is one of the

884
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:53,980
leaders in cyber warfare yes it is true

885
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:56,980
but I also think it's not super

886
00:43:53,980 --> 00:44:00,089
interesting because Israel involved is

887
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:02,740
involved in cyber in the Middle East and

888
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:04,569
most people don't really care about the

889
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,149
Middle East it doesn't have such a big

890
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:09,730
effect like the election in the u.s. it

891
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:13,720
has a lot more effect to our day-to-day

892
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:16,540
life where we have to fight terror I do

893
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,759
think that we are being as responsible

894
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,308
as possible and try to help other

895
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,640
countries to prevent terror attacks as

896
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:26,079
we did in the past

897
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:30,009
if you're more interested to hear about

898
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:32,559
life at 8,200 which is the Israeli cyber

899
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:35,980
security unit you're welcome

900
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:40,450
to hear the podcast of darknet diaries

901
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:45,339
where I talked quite a lot about my life

902
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:48,640
at the unit and how young men and women

903
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:51,849
get accepted there what kind of work do

904
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:55,390
we do and the great feeling at the age

905
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:58,660
of 18 that you're actually saving life

906
00:44:55,390 --> 00:45:02,410
from behind a computer this is an

907
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:04,480
exciting feeling that even now after

908
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,520
leaving the military after only a few

909
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,869
years I would know I I know I will never

910
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:13,960
get such a fulfillment no matter where I

911
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:19,809
go to work so if you want you're welcome

912
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:22,180
to hear that podcast I want to sum up

913
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:26,170
with the attack patterns that we usually

914
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:28,328
see with state-sponsored attacks so it

915
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,600
obviously obviously starts with a very

916
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:32,800
good

917
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:35,410
reconnaissance the takeover and the

918
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,600
establishing of the foothold so that no

919
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:40,870
matter what you will always be able to

920
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,160
get back the privilege escalation cycle

921
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:44,920
where you always do a little more

922
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,190
reconnaissance get more credentials and

923
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,230
maintain your persistence and then

924
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,610
complete your mission get wherever it is

925
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,920
that you wanted to get get the

926
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:57,670
information you want to get and go back

927
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:01,030
home and never to forget the more basic

928
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:03,970
step before that and that is the choose

929
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:07,390
your target wisely you're a country you

930
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,890
don't have time to spray your you're

931
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:12,370
attacking tools around you have to be

932
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:14,859
very very specific and craft the attack

933
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:17,109
accordingly

934
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:19,300
people ask me okay so what can we do can

935
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:23,740
we defend ourselves from such attacks

936
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:25,690
and I mean I can stand here and talk to

937
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:29,470
you for hours about network

938
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:32,590
segmentations and passwords and not to

939
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:35,859
expose on us unnecessary assets to the

940
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:38,050
internet and do proper logging and do

941
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,850
anomaly detection and use machine

942
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:43,390
learning we can talk about all of that

943
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:46,450
but I think you know all about it

944
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:49,060
much better than me I think that there

945
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:51,879
are more philosophical questions we need

946
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:54,600
to ask ourselves because if this is an

947
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,490
arm race and if this is the Cold War

948
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,529
what can we do about it I don't think

949
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:01,870
that buying more security products is

950
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,820
the solution for that we need to talk

951
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:07,600
about why are we building those weapons

952
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:11,970
and what can we do differently so that

953
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:15,430
we will not need these weapons anymore

954
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:18,520
before I finish I would like to take the

955
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:22,359
opportunity to say something yesterday

956
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:24,400
we had the most wonderful dinner for the

957
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,680
speakers that the organizer of the

958
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,570
conference organized for us and first of

959
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,879
all thank you so much it was wonderful

960
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:33,430
and this whole conference is really

961
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,980
really nice but as I said around the

962
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:38,470
table I look to my right and I look to

963
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:41,660
my left and I realized I was the only

964
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:44,299
female speaker at the conference

965
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,670
and that didn't feel weird because I'm

966
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:49,849
used to sit around tables when I'm the

967
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:51,680
only woman and I'm really really used to

968
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:54,740
that it really wasn't a big deal for me

969
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,828
but today we're talking a lot about

970
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:00,709
diversity especially insecurity and what

971
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:02,690
can we do to have more women in the

972
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,990
industry and I understood that the

973
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:07,849
problem was it not enough women

974
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:10,189
submitted their talks to the conference

975
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:14,390
and this is why you see less women on

976
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:15,710
the stage but why did fewer women submit

977
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:19,430
in the first place

978
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:21,859
well doesn't matter why I invite all of

979
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,359
you to encourage your male and female

980
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:26,089
colleagues when you go back to your

981
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,980
office to submit something to write a

982
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:32,450
blog about something about a nice

983
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:34,700
project that they did and have more

984
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:37,368
women on stage because that will

985
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:40,129
encourage more women to submit and more

986
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:45,319
women to get into cybersecurity because

987
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:48,859
it's not a topic or subject only for men

988
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:51,380
it's for everyone and just being a

989
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:55,130
little afraid because I didn't see other

990
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:57,920
women on stage before it's a reason but

991
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:00,140
it's not a good reason not not to submit

992
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,369
so I encourage you all the male

993
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:06,890
participants to encourage your female

994
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:09,500
co-workers to do that more it's super

995
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:12,020
important to see more women on the stage

996
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:15,230
and around them trying to look around

997
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:17,538
not too many female faces around here I

998
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:21,700
hope I will be here next year and see

999
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:21,700
more women thank you so much

1000
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:34,870
and I'll be happy to take questions now

1001
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:35,830
later whenever thank you so much here

1002
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:37,990
that was amazing

1003
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:39,819
really good talk and yes we do have time

1004
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:41,350
for questions so I'm gonna send you

1005
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,510
sprouts into the audience with a

1006
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:46,029
microphone if we have any questions

1007
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:58,630
should waste your hands if you do don't

1008
00:49:46,030 --> 00:50:01,330
be shy so there's a culture in let's say

1009
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:03,940
the Western world of naming state actors

1010
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:06,009
for cool names like fancy bear or cool

1011
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:09,190
panda or something like that but there's

1012
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:11,560
not really any alternative like IDF they

1013
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:14,470
still call IDF the NSA is to a call and

1014
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:18,700
say why is that is there a culture thing

1015
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:23,109
or why our Eastern culture is not doing

1016
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:25,960
that so regarding Israel I think that we

1017
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:28,500
just don't have that many malware's that

1018
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,180
deserve family who've names

1019
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:34,560
unfortunately and I think that some

1020
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:39,549
American mothers actually do have names

1021
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:41,830
kinda I think that the thing is not the

1022
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:43,870
names or the culture I think that some

1023
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:47,560
countries like Israel in the US and the

1024
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:50,620
UK and France they're not that brutal in

1025
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,720
the cyber arena and their tools are not

1026
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:56,319
that easily found maybe they're not even

1027
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,720
left around to be found whereas other

1028
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,840
countries like North Korea like China

1029
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,049
like Russia they play around more loudly

1030
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,550
so this is why they have a lot of tools

1031
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,960
out there they have to use a lot of

1032
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:10,510
tools because otherwise it will get

1033
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,430
detected the antivirus will sign on them

1034
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:18,160
and that's it so they need a lot of

1035
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:20,370
variants and they get named have another

1036
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,370
one

1037
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:32,020
hi my question is we talked about China

1038
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,849
we talked about us and everything but

1039
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,369
according to my knowledge

1040
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:38,230
if you product if you deliver any cheap

1041
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:40,420
or anything it will go to the

1042
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:42,460
third-party labs which will take your

1043
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:45,160
securities and it also have to follow

1044
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:47,500
some of a protocol you can say that some

1045
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,540
standards so although we have so many

1046
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,839
protocols so many standards then how the

1047
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:56,740
company is bypassing that and what is

1048
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:59,078
the solution for that so what is the

1049
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:02,078
solution I think that we need to vote

1050
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:03,640
with our hands so I don't think we

1051
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,329
should be using products that are not

1052
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:11,379
keeping our data safe how do how do

1053
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:15,309
countries bypass the the security

1054
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:17,049
measurements that the company has well

1055
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:19,990
they have their own ways because they

1056
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:22,569
can find zero days in the kernel kernel

1057
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:25,868
level they can find zero days on the

1058
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:29,770
processor I don't know if specter and

1059
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:31,720
meltdown where ever you know really used

1060
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:34,690
but if they were used I would guess they

1061
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:37,169
were used by a country and we don't know

1062
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:39,880
about it so there are always ways to

1063
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:43,780
exploit these devices even though they

1064
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,790
were designed to be very very safe what

1065
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:56,230
is why it's a country one final question

1066
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:58,720
anyone there we have wood I'm I have a

1067
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:04,750
question regarding cyber warfare what do

1068
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:07,180
you think the IDF attack on the Hamas

1069
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:10,710
headquarters or what it was means for

1070
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:14,020
cyber warfare and what's changed by that

1071
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:16,750
so I'm no longer in the military for a

1072
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:20,020
couple of years now so this is strictly

1073
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:22,480
my own opinion I didn't really

1074
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:24,309
understand why would they attack the

1075
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,470
Hamas headquarters because if I were

1076
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:28,329
Hamas I would definitely have backup for

1077
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:31,009
everything this is the digital world the

1078
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:33,710
physics doesn't matter anymore

1079
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:35,990
so I'm only thinking that maybe they did

1080
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:40,670
not have backups and maybe now they're

1081
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:45,459
having a hard time to hack or to

1082
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:45,460
manipulate with a with Israeli internet

1083
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:56,950
good thank you so much thank you for

1084
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:56,950
having me thanks that's great
