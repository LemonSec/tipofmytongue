1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,899
we're gonna start our story off today in

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:09,990
ancient Rome where this guy this is

3
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:12,840
Marcus Tullius Cicero and he was the

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,990
most famous orator of all of ancient

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:21,198
Rome and he was widely loved for his

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,198
character and integrity it's a bit high

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:34,649
so he was so loved that he was asked to

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:37,890
prosecute his boss by the people people

9
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,410
loved him so very much that they thought

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,540
his manager or boss the governor of

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,599
Sicily who was plundering the public

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,870
coffers and obviously they were outraged

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,489
by this and so the governor of Sicily

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,160
did what anyone would do

15
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,360
they hired at the time the most famous

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:01,589
orator and lawyer of ancient Rome and

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:04,349
Cicero went up and he won and he won for

18
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,100
a couple of reasons the first one was

19
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:10,798
obviously his oratory skill the second

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,890
was all the evidence he gathered he

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,750
spent time gathering testimonies talking

22
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,540
to people getting them to come forward

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,549
as witnesses and taking bookkeeping

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,759
notes and records and Cicero likes to

25
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,640
tell a lot of stories about evidence and

26
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,979
one of them is about this guy this is in

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,220
the middle Diagoras of rhodes he's an

28
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,520
ancient Greek and Diagoras was a lot

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,100
like a modern-day Muhammad Ali he won

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,710
the boxing at the Olympics and not just

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,939
once he won it twice and these two

32
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,539
people on either side of him these are

33
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,158
two of his sons and one of his son won

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,399
the boxing at the Olympics as well and

35
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,790
the other son and the middle son and his

36
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:01,439
grandson and his other grandson there

37
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,719
was obviously something in the water but

38
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,199
Diagoras at some point was presented

39
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,769
with some painted plates as

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,810
congratulations on his victory and these

41
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,560
painted plates depicted some Poseidon

42
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,260
worshippers

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,870
and they were at sea their boat being

44
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,269
lashed with waves and they thought they

45
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,760
were going to die and so they did the

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,610
only thing that they knew how to do they

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,899
pray to Poseidon to spare them and spare

48
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,760
them he did and when Diagoras received

49
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,000
these plates the first question that

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,609
sprung into his lips was where are the

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,610
plates to those that prayed but drowned

52
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:48,299
survivor bias or negative evidence and

53
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,810
negative evidence is all around us all

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,910
the time it's doing its thing and we're

55
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:57,570
we're worse off for it there's another

56
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:01,170
very very obvious situation with

57
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,500
negative evidence it's this guy a humble

58
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,540
Turkey for years the turkey just sort of

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,480
wanders around its enclosure pecking

60
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:14,280
away in the dirt thinking everything is

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:17,369
going to be fine and one month before

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,940
Thanksgiving perhaps the turkey receives

63
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:27,660
a very Swift URI education almost

64
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:29,790
instant negative evidence is a huge

65
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,630
problem in IT security it might not

66
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,780
sound like it we're not turkeys but it's

67
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,269
everywhere around us and all of this

68
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,700
boils down to absence of evidence is not

69
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:46,890
evidence of absence in fact is even an

70
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:50,730
OAuth top 10 entry on exactly this

71
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:54,720
subject it's insufficient logging and

72
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,298
monitoring now insufficient logging and

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,150
monitoring there's an OAuth cheat sheet

74
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:03,650
that tells us that if you have a

75
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,840
penetration test you should be able to

76
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,000
figure out the amount of damage that the

77
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,769
penetration tester did just from

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,769
reviewing your logs and your monitoring

79
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,470
I'm not sure I could stand up here and

80
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,209
say that I can absolutely do that I'm

81
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,659
feel pretty confident but I'm not a

82
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,360
hundred percent sure because if I don't

83
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:31,340
know about it then I can't make it

84
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,970
good decisions based on it and

85
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,000
insufficient logging and monitoring

86
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:40,199
negative evidence has another name which

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,629
is a huge problem for IT security its

88
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:49,580
shadow IT shadow IT is just what happens

89
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:53,539
when people want to do their jobs and

90
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:57,120
you're not providing what they want and

91
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:59,520
what they can source themselves maybe it

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,460
takes a long time for somebody in your

93
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,090
organization to get some VMs and they

94
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,419
don't want to have to go through

95
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,609
ordering the hardware ship it to a data

96
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:11,128
somewhere data center somewhere get it

97
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,409
racked and then get some infrastructure

98
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,870
technicians to put the VMS on it and

99
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:17,789
then hand it over or maybe the AWS

100
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,590
accounts you have to jump through a

101
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:23,360
bunch of Hoops in order to get AWS

102
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:26,638
accounts maybe it takes too long and

103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,750
people just want to do their jobs I just

104
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,090
want to do my job too

105
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,050
I think perhaps in a previous life I've

106
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:37,289
created some shadow IT myself and shadow

107
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:41,009
IT for me was solidified immeasurably

108
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:44,818
when I saw on this very stage a few

109
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:48,810
years ago a guy called Dave Dave Lewis

110
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:51,389
and he said I love shadow IT tells me

111
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,180
what I'm not delivering and it's

112
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,250
absolutely true and we'll hear about

113
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,759
Dave's flaming sword of justice tomorrow

114
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,560
I personally can't wait but I got a Venn

115
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,240
diagram here as well for what you're not

116
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,190
delivering what you're prepared to sell

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,610
source people feel they need that bit in

118
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,310
the middle there does this work it's

119
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:15,599
like a fairy that dub it there is the

120
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:18,139
shadow IT and that's a huge problem for

121
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,159
all of us in this room we will work in

122
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:24,990
consultancies enterprises maybe with

123
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:27,629
students but charities everywhere and I

124
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,639
don't have a silver bullet for you or

125
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:33,460
even several silver bullets or even like

126
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:37,750
a bronze bullet but I do have some candy

127
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:40,568
and candy where I work is one of the

128
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,300
most diverse and useful and more

129
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:46,960
importantly cheap tools that we have

130
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,699
available we use it for everything every

131
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,330
interaction with a security team

132
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,949
involves candy in fact I have some candy

133
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,008
for the first person to ask a question

134
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:59,590
and the second person to ask a question

135
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:14,490
and the third person and then the

136
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:14,489
runner-up prizes for number four so a

137
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,539
round of applause for throwing a

138
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:22,680
lollipop that's good it's good that

139
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:25,630
we've set the expectations really low

140
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,270
but we use every interaction with the

141
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,340
security team where I work we want it to

142
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,909
be as metaphorically and physically

143
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:36,159
sweet as possible so we buy candy I know

144
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:38,259
how much we buy because I buy all the

145
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,610
candy we always get individually wrapped

146
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,340
stuff because nobody wants to dip their

147
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,409
hand into stuff that other people have

148
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,940
been dipping their hands in the two

149
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:48,340
things you should never ever take a

150
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,659
bacterial swab off your toothbrush and

151
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:55,270
your keyboard but if somebody comes to

152
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:57,009
us and they ask a question before they

153
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,419
sit down and ask the question I make

154
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,310
sure I give them candy I make sure that

155
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,500
they understand that this is going to

156
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,800
happen you're going to get candy any

157
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,479
kind of question at all maybe you're

158
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,400
gonna ask me what kind of Rooter you

159
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,780
should have at home or what kind of

160
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,969
password manager you should use in your

161
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,198
home life I'm gonna make sure you get

162
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:15,880
candy at the very beginning of the

163
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:21,539
interaction and probably at the end too

164
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:25,030
I give it away literally like candy and

165
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:27,130
we work in an office of maybe 200 people

166
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,210
in Stockholm and it's

167
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,330
development-oriented

168
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:38,078
so there's I would say maybe 70% of the

169
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:41,770
people commit code at some point and not

170
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:44,339
everybody commits code and we use it for

171
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,339
our bug bounty

172
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,060
everybody the finds another zero day or

173
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,730
uh code execution in one of our web apps

174
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,949
then they they get a lot of candy but

175
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,290
you can't keep it just two people that

176
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,820
commit code I want everyone all 200

177
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,069
people in that office to be thinking

178
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,589
about how they can interact with the

179
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:06,010
people in our team and get candy for it

180
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:07,990
so if you find a physical vulnerability

181
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,540
like a window that's open and it

182
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,230
shouldn't be or a door everybody every

183
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:16,390
single person in this room has this

184
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,610
physical sorry this err threat modeling

185
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,560
built in for physical security you

186
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,680
wouldn't leave your door to your house

187
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,599
open or a window open so if you just

188
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,099
apply that at work you can get some

189
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,490
candy sweet and we make sure that

190
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,650
everybody can see the bug bounty list as

191
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,300
well we have a leader board and make

192
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,010
sure it's on our internal wiki it's

193
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,660
posted up around the office you know in

194
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,939
the bathroom so you can find out what's

195
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,370
happening whilst you're spending some

196
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,410
time alone

197
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,279
but it does lots and lots of things

198
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:54,520
candy it builds outreach it's absolutely

199
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,560
fantastic I make sure everybody the

200
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,390
books are meeting with me knows that I

201
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,579
will take a lot of candy to that meeting

202
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,550
like this is small stuff like I take

203
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,070
this much candy and then that meeting is

204
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,979
gonna be slightly better you keep the

205
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:13,959
blood sugar up keep the diabetes rolling

206
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:16,750
and at the beginning when we started

207
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,790
doing this people booked a lot more

208
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:23,290
meetings with us it's true and that

209
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:25,000
happens a lot but suddenly I started

210
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,219
having visibility into projects that

211
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,790
were months or years away rather than

212
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,500
just days or weeks I got to learn about

213
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,349
the problems people are going to have in

214
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:40,570
the future and then design security into

215
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:43,060
their product at the base layer and most

216
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,240
importantly it's cheap it's really

217
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,670
really cheap I think we spend a few

218
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,500
hundred euros on it a year and that's

219
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,290
around the same prices maybe sort of

220
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,940
three spotify premium subscriptions this

221
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,500
is nothing this is the cheapest all you

222
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:03,130
can have apart from free open-source

223
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:06,760
we're now apart from all these things I

224
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,760
have some question marks

225
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:15,500
it's that golden hour after lunch where

226
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,590
the food comas it's in so we're going to

227
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,420
do some physical exercise now so I'd

228
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,420
like to ask you all to please stand up

229
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,740
if you're willing and able if you don't

230
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,570
want to it's fine maybe you're doing the

231
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:36,890
CTF I understand and now I'd like to put

232
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,390
get your hands put them like this we're

233
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,449
not gonna imagine a ball of energy or

234
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,770
anything like that it's fine and whilst

235
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,460
we're all standing here feeling quite

236
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,560
awkward a guarantee none as awkward as I

237
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,170
I would like to ask the security fest

238
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,670
team to come up to the stage

239
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,170
whilst we repeatedly smash our hands

240
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,160
together in a big round of applause for

241
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,160
everyone here

242
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:16,970
we just need to get behind him

243
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:16,970
[Applause]

244
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,140
so I brought your present it's not a

245
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,870
rabid badger it's not moving

246
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,520
would you like to unwrap it you know you

247
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,520
know that we'd love you though I'm not

248
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:36,490
opening that one you don't get that open

249
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:40,010
it okay yeah yeah hard just trust me

250
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:42,250
okay let's do it three two one that was

251
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,250
fast

252
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:48,670
all for me we could all sit down now

253
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,910
it's fine yeah I want to take one can i

254
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:54,380
what no it's not for you okay so I

255
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,730
thought it'd be a bit disingenuous of me

256
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,500
to come here and talk about candy

257
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,280
without bringing candy for everyone

258
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,730
so there's 800 pairs refills 400 chopper

259
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,530
chops

260
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,910
it's a bring your own device conference

261
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,930
so I imagine everybody has their own PEZ

262
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:12,920
dispenser I'm gonna leave the logistics

263
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,569
of handing it out up to you guys I think

264
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,650
we should I think that's a fantastic

265
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:20,020
idea let's do it

266
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,020
now you're welcome

267
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,710
it's a lot of candy though okay are

268
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,630
these hard they are hard I would not

269
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:35,550
recommend throwing them out use this you

270
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:37,830
saw my my so let's carry on worse at

271
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,530
last this is all happening we should get

272
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,750
to you get now what can you use candy

273
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:45,290
for apart from completely disrupting a

274
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,840
conference talk halfway through

275
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:52,349
well just straight-up bribes

276
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:55,110
I use it to bribe people all the time

277
00:13:52,350 --> 00:14:00,980
you would be surprised what a full pack

278
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:04,740
of bila can get you it's quite a lot and

279
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,090
sometimes there are people who say

280
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,500
diabetic to the people in the audience

281
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,300
who are diabetic I'm sorry I don't have

282
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,340
any candy for you perhaps the salt like

283
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:16,020
Ritz is actually sugar-free because it

284
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:17,940
tastes disgusting but but the people who

285
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:21,480
are diabetic or on a diet of whatever it

286
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,760
is I remind them that you can use this

287
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,350
to bribe somebody else you just got a I

288
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,430
mean it's a straight-up tokenization

289
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:33,240
system it's kudos it's cool points it's

290
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:39,109
just a little gift from me to that

291
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:42,950
person and now we get to the real meat

292
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:46,830
it's trust now people in my organization

293
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:50,340
they trust me to give them candy because

294
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:52,850
I do it all the time I am predictable in

295
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,970
my nature of giving people candy and

296
00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:00,900
Trust is incredibly important Warren

297
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:03,390
Buffett says that you can spend 20 years

298
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,590
building a reputation and it can be

299
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,590
burnt down in five minutes

300
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,060
anyone who's ever been cheated on in a

301
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:18,180
relationship knows exactly how quickly

302
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:21,300
trust can disintegrate and they trust me

303
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,739
all my users they trust me that I have

304
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,579
their best interests at heart because I

305
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,040
constantly reaffirm I trust you I said

306
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,750
all the time in fact I say it so much

307
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,339
that now I got a few friends in the

308
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,689
audience and some people watching back

309
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,980
in the office hello

310
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:38,019
they're gonna notice that I have this

311
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,600
verbal tic I say I trust you a lot and

312
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,309
it's part of a reciprocal gift-giving

313
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,319
nature of human interaction whose

314
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:50,079
inevitable result is trust I trust my

315
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:51,878
users and in turn they trust me if I

316
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,069
have to replace restrictive rules on

317
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:55,839
them like we have to block this malware

318
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:58,089
site or we have to reimage your computer

319
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,379
because there's a virus on it and they

320
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:05,079
trust I have their best interests at

321
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:07,360
heart which I do but how do you build

322
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:11,019
trust with people just magically I mean

323
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:15,610
candy is a good start but if we look at

324
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:20,309
low cost a low low cost low trust rather

325
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:24,549
low trust is the greatest cost in life

326
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:26,860
low trust creates friction hidden

327
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:29,619
agendas office politics interpersonal

328
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:34,149
conflict interdepartmental rivalries

329
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:42,069
it's insanely expensive it can destroy

330
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:46,419
families businesses everything and low

331
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:50,618
trust is so important that in the USA

332
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:52,119
they ran a poll I think recently where

333
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:55,779
they asked people how much do you trust

334
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:58,239
political parties does anyone who has

335
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:05,648
other guests how what percentage of

336
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:07,120
people it's under 10 it's 8% and there's

337
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:12,879
a lot going on in american politics so i

338
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:15,658
can see why the trust might be so low in

339
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:20,230
the UK 29% of people trust each other

340
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:25,260
the good news though Scandinavia 68% go

341
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:27,929
Sweden very very trustworthy Society and

342
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,299
Ralph Waldo Emerson put it perfectly

343
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:34,929
when he said our distrust is very

344
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:38,049
expensive low trust creates friction it

345
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:41,010
reduces speed and it increases costs

346
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:41,010
immeasurably

347
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:50,420
now this trust is extremely expensive so

348
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,020
if you want to get rid of the distrust

349
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:56,210
and build trust we have to start with

350
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,490
integrity and I know it's really

351
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,790
annoying like the true friendship

352
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,560
treasure was inside you the whole time

353
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:09,760
but let me tell you about this guy this

354
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:13,340
is Andy Roddick and in 2005 at the

355
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,770
Italia Masters competition it was the

356
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,590
3rd round and he was playing against a

357
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:23,000
guy called Fernando Verdasco

358
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:27,379
and it was match point in favor of

359
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,890
Roddick and it was Verdasco's second

360
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:36,230
service if he misses this it's over and

361
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:37,540
he's out and when he served the umpire

362
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,610
called out

363
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:44,320
Verdasco walked up to the net shake

364
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:47,510
erotics hand and to the surprise of

365
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,510
Verdasco and the crowd Roddick went up

366
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:52,400
and started arguing with the umpire he

367
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,350
called the umpires attention to a small

368
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,150
indentation that showed that the ball

369
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:01,870
actually landed on the line rather than

370
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:07,280
out Verdasco went on to win that match

371
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:08,739
and Roddick left Italy but if you think

372
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,490
about that for a minute

373
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,780
his integrity now is unquestioned he

374
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:19,940
could have just taken the point and

375
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:21,350
walked away victorious but every time he

376
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,530
has an interaction with an umpire that

377
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:28,209
umpires going to know that he is acting

378
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:32,480
with integrity he's living his values

379
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:35,330
and if we can have our reputation

380
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,020
precede us in security just like Roddick

381
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,600
does then every time we go to see a user

382
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,540
to talk to them about whatever kind of

383
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,330
suspicious sites they've been browsing

384
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,620
then they're going to know that we have

385
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,629
their best interests at heart

386
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,639
and that we're doing it because we care

387
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,640
and we want them to succeed and

388
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:06,250
increasing integrity is hard I'm not

389
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:07,870
gonna lie to you it's difficult there's

390
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,060
a few things you have to do to increase

391
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,489
your integrity then the number one walk

392
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,290
the walk if you make commitments you

393
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,960
keep those commitments even if it's a

394
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:19,570
family dinner or if it's not a project

395
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,710
that you're going to work on

396
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:25,899
I myself have occasional difficulty with

397
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,710
this when it comes to around January and

398
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:31,770
you go and buy the gym card and then you

399
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,680
commit to going to the gym every day

400
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:39,100
then around February March

401
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,690
you don't go so much but if people see

402
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,159
that you keep going if people see that

403
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,830
you keep making those commitments and

404
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,500
keeping them they're going to be really

405
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:52,300
really happy and they're going to

406
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:55,060
believe in your integrity second you got

407
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,970
to be clear about your values you have

408
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:01,210
to be able to stand up on a stage in

409
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:05,050
front of 320 people and talk about what

410
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:09,120
you feel is right and Trust is something

411
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,120
that I feel is extremely important

412
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,140
there's a way you can figure out what

413
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,260
your values are it's called their eulogy

414
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:22,990
exercise and it's a bit morbid but

415
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:25,990
essentially you just write down the

416
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,150
eulogy that you would like to have read

417
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,340
out at your funeral

418
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,930
this person was a person of this type of

419
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,149
character this person did this with

420
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:37,210
their life this person did that these

421
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:42,070
were their values and then you go and

422
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:46,290
live those values because to believe in

423
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:49,629
something and not live it is dishonest

424
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,760
success at any point at any cost is not

425
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,350
the point at all

426
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,879
you've got to win the right way whether

427
00:21:53,350 --> 00:22:01,679
it's accountability teamwork quality

428
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,680
integrity matters

429
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:09,440
and you also have to be very open-minded

430
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:12,200
you have to be willing to reevaluate how

431
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,890
you feel about something let me tell you

432
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:19,520
about this guy this is Anwar Sadat he

433
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:24,650
was the president of Egypt 1970 until

434
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,270
his assassination in 1981 and Sadat

435
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,610
spent some time in jail before he was

436
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:33,530
president and he came to realize he

437
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:36,080
needed to open up about stuff and he was

438
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:39,440
raised in a very anti Israeli culture

439
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:44,510
and the leadership was very anti Israeli

440
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:47,030
but nevertheless many Chim begin beggin

441
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:51,170
the Israeli prime minister reached out

442
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:53,210
to him and said come to Israel speak

443
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,790
before the Knesset which is the Israeli

444
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:59,390
Parliament and this is a picture of him

445
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:03,680
doing exactly that he put aside old

446
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:06,110
rivalries distrust and went and talked

447
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,810
to them later on

448
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:12,379
beggin and Sadat both travelled to

449
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:16,070
America to meet with Jimmy Carter where

450
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,860
they signed the Camp David Accords this

451
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:23,720
man being open-minded probably saved

452
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:31,040
thousands of lives and they both got the

453
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:33,860
Nobel Peace Prize as well now intent is

454
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,770
also very very very important we tend to

455
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,330
judge ourselves on our intent I was

456
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,920
going to do that thing but I didn't get

457
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:45,530
round to it and others on their behavior

458
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,140
if you can Telegraph what your intent is

459
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:50,870
to people it will reduce that gap

460
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,840
between intent and behavior if people

461
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:57,310
make sure they know why you're doing

462
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:03,169
something they'll be more inclined to

463
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:05,330
think alike and Immanuel Kant says in

464
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,850
law a man is guilty when he violates the

465
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:12,010
rights of another in ethics he's guilty

466
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,010
if he only thinks of doing so

467
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,490
so if we make sure we try to judge

468
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,640
others by their intent and their

469
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:24,390
behavior and ourselves by our intent and

470
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:28,260
behavior we can become more synonymous

471
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:29,940
with each other now this slide I don't

472
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,670
think anybody in this room is going to

473
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,250
have a problem with this is the constant

474
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,810
learning slide and everybody in this

475
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,700
room is at this conference

476
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,800
you're here to learn so you're already

477
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,320
doing excellently I can judge by your

478
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,899
behavior that you're here you've just

479
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,090
got to keep learning keep hacking away

480
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:51,180
keep writing code keep hacking their

481
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:56,310
hardware keep writing presentations and

482
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:58,770
coming to conferences information

483
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,570
security I think does not really have a

484
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:04,440
big problem with this so this is fine

485
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:08,639
and the only constant in the universe

486
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:12,320
for me is change and this is my favorite

487
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,780
quote oh it's not this is the wrong one

488
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,570
but left unintended untended

489
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,270
knowledge and skill like all assets

490
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:24,149
depreciate in value surprisingly quickly

491
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:25,650
now this is my favorite quote if you

492
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:29,850
don't like change you're gonna like

493
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:31,770
irrelevance even less information

494
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,750
security is constantly evolving it's

495
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,430
constantly pushing boundaries and we

496
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,200
need to keep up with it and the blue

497
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:39,030
team as well as the red team blue team

498
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,370
doesn't have anywhere near as much fun

499
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:47,910
as a red team I feel the last part in

500
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,560
the second to last part is results

501
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,240
you've got to come up with the results

502
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,429
once you make that commitment you keep

503
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,970
that commitment and you come up with

504
00:25:53,430 --> 00:26:00,720
results do the thing hack the thing talk

505
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:07,800
to people because results are what we

506
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:10,800
judge others on a II used to teach a

507
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,950
class and stock hammer to some students

508
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,740
and sometimes they would have

509
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:19,050
assignments and sometimes they would

510
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,450
need an extension and the students that

511
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,580
always brought me the assignments on

512
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,110
time they asked for an extension

513
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,270
I would always give it to them

514
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,669
because I knew that normally their

515
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:35,370
results mattered and their results came

516
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:37,700
through now there are some behaviors of

517
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,540
trust as well we should talk about and

518
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,760
we're going to go through these rather

519
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,800
rapidly but you should talk straight

520
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,280
don't mince your words don't tell the

521
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:49,139
technical truth

522
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,060
you should demonstrate respect my

523
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,480
grandmother used to say that manners are

524
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,250
free and it's true it takes a very

525
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,180
little energy to I know hold the door

526
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:03,380
open for someone create transparency in

527
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:06,690
everything you do the bug bounty

528
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,730
leaderboard we have that's transparent

529
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,210
everybody can see where that is it's in

530
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,850
the toilet

531
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,380
I mean it's it's difficult to avoid to

532
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,689
be perfectly honest and that's

533
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,390
intentional

534
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:21,650
you should write wrongs as well I like

535
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:25,670
to admit I'm wrong as soon as I know

536
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,670
because I used to be pretty bad at it

537
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:32,910
you should show loyalty and extend trust

538
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,980
if you extend trust to people they will

539
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:39,990
extend the trust right back it's repres

540
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:42,870
Otte now we can go back to the candy for

541
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:46,110
a bit now impromptu education czar one

542
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:50,100
of my favorite parts about using candy

543
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:52,620
in this way if you have to go to someone

544
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,020
who's maybe their email has popped up on

545
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,739
have I been poned because obviously you

546
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,840
maintain a subscription to that and you

547
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:05,190
need to tell them some bad news you need

548
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:07,800
to give them a bad news day but if you

549
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,520
take candy to them there's already off

550
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,440
to a good start

551
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,940
and you're probably going to have to

552
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,290
explain a credential stuffing attack

553
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,480
you're going to have to tell them to

554
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,940
roll their passwords might have to

555
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,690
suggest a kind of password manager for

556
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,480
them take toffee it keeps their mouth

557
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:30,410
busy

558
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:32,270
and at the end of it make sure they have

559
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:37,400
a good experience as well now I need

560
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:40,570
some equipment for this next slide this

561
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,940
looks professional doesn't it

562
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:46,210
colonoscopies that's what I really

563
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:52,670
wanted to talk to you about today

564
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:56,840
there's there's two psychologists called

565
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:59,900
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky and

566
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,030
they were excellent psychologists and

567
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,980
they wrote a book which I think probably

568
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,740
a lot of you have called Thinking Fast

569
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,600
and Slow and if you haven't read that

570
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,270
book immediately go and buy and read

571
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,889
that book it's fantastic and they have a

572
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:16,160
lot of psychological case studies in

573
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:18,260
this book and one of them is on people

574
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,840
who are undergoing this rather invasive

575
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:24,110
medical procedures where they put the

576
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,090
camera up and it's very very painful

577
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,439
takes about 20 minutes or at least it

578
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:31,330
used to when they conducted this study

579
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,550
and so they split people up into

580
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,110
experimental and control groups and the

581
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,389
people in the control group had the

582
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,939
20-minute procedure then later on they

583
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:43,910
interviewed them and the people in the

584
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:47,660
experimental group had the procedure for

585
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:50,510
20 minutes of pain and then five minutes

586
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,270
of mild discomfort now I don't know what

587
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:56,450
they meant by that but it sounds very

588
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:58,910
unpleasant but then when they asked the

589
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,950
people afterwards in the interview how

590
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:06,140
did you experience how do you recall

591
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:09,200
this invasive medical procedure that

592
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:12,170
occurred to you the people who

593
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,110
objectively suffered more pain in the

594
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:18,470
experimental group recalled the

595
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,850
experience more fondly if you dial the

596
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,770
pain down at the end of something

597
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,530
terrible

598
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:27,350
then people remember it better in a more

599
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,490
fond light I mean 20 minutes of extreme

600
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:32,629
pain I think everybody's going to

601
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:34,660
remember but that's why at the end of

602
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,910
your impromptu education with this user

603
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,460
give them a lot of candy like

604
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:44,120
indulge them there's another word for

605
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,180
this type of feedback I think in Sweden

606
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,860
it's called the by smacker

607
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,980
that proof sandwich that's where you get

608
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,719
a piece of nice feedback he's a bad

609
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,970
feedback and another piece of nice

610
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:02,090
feedback so you sandwich the bad

611
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:08,480
feedback with good feedback and this

612
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:10,419
works it works very very well another

613
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,400
thing I wanted to talk about was

614
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:15,700
influence if you can influence an

615
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,230
organization or family or business

616
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:22,970
you're off to a very very good start

617
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:26,240
and there's exercises you can do to

618
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,650
figure out who you are and how you

619
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,290
should approach people and who other

620
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:32,660
people are as well now I did this first

621
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,360
I think this class happened to me 10

622
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:38,990
years ago this is not the I've stolen

623
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,209
this from work thank you candy but these

624
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:43,510
are the types of people are are so

625
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,890
amiable people they're sort of

626
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:48,890
supportive resilient empathetic loyal

627
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:51,830
team oriented expressive people creative

628
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,990
flexible visionary this is my design

629
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,480
department as far as I'm concerned these

630
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,530
people are extremely expressive

631
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,020
especially in their feedback to me about

632
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:02,899
what type of candy I buy and then

633
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:06,500
analytical's objective precise organized

634
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:08,990
rational think testers I used to be a

635
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,550
tester and I kind of see a lot of myself

636
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,100
in this I'm certainly not organized

637
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:16,370
though and in drivers a fast-paced

638
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:20,800
strong decisive responsible demanding

639
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,550
and these are the types of people

640
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,889
everybody in this room will identify

641
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,930
with at least one of these things some

642
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:30,110
people two maybe even three it's

643
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:31,730
unlikely to be all four but if you can

644
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:35,510
figure out what type of person someone

645
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:39,290
is you can then figure out what to do

646
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:41,210
when you approach them and for amiable

647
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,899
people invest time in chatting offer

648
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,550
reassurance that ask them open questions

649
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,380
expressive I love this one at the end

650
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,408
get a decision when they are excited

651
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,149
that sounds quite manipulative but

652
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:55,490
have a two-way conversation use stories

653
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:57,080
and pictures analytical people want you

654
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,990
to be on point they want you stay on

655
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,509
task show different options allow time

656
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,649
for questions and drivers one high paced

657
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:07,399
straight to the point

658
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:10,309
use direct language now ten years ago

659
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:12,860
when I first took this class I was

660
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:16,309
trying to get stuff approved at work my

661
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,529
boss was an excellent person but I could

662
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:20,779
never quite get approval quickly it

663
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:26,149
would take me months to get budgets or

664
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:27,649
other things approved and after I did

665
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:31,699
this I figured out what kind of person

666
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:33,559
my boss was they're very much in the red

667
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:37,159
zone this is when I used to work in the

668
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:40,519
video games industry and I changed my

669
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:44,659
approach I came to them with a clear

670
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:47,389
risk analysis cost-benefit all the kind

671
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:51,049
of stuff they wanted and I made sure

672
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:52,459
that all they needed to do really was

673
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:56,929
just rubber-stamp it and then it would

674
00:33:52,460 --> 00:34:00,470
get done and it did it worked the same

675
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:02,570
day in fact the same meeting and then

676
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,240
afterwards I kept going back in the same

677
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:08,710
manner and it kept working and working

678
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:12,699
and working and all of these things

679
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:19,099
influence and Trust and especially candy

680
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:22,250
this is not a panacea for shadow IT but

681
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:25,510
it's something that's going to help us a

682
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:28,429
lot and you can sum all of this up as

683
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:31,819
just social engineering for the blue

684
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:35,869
team the red team gets all the fun we've

685
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:38,509
got to start doing this as well social

686
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:40,819
engineering for the red team is breaking

687
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,010
in for us it should be building up the

688
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:47,659
walls of defense around our organization

689
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:49,159
and I couldn't come here and tell you

690
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:52,069
all these things I believe without

691
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:55,760
having some complete anecdotal evidence

692
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:58,430
that supports my point and there's no

693
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,090
science in this whatsoever so I'd like

694
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:06,960
to tell you about my Lenna

695
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:08,400
millena is a fantastic person she's one

696
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,230
of the most competitive people I think

697
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,850
I've ever met in my life I think she

698
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:17,160
grew up with maybe eight brothers or

699
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:20,910
something and where we work we do in the

700
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,730
IT operations area we do a planking

701
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:26,460
exercise at 2:00 p.m. just to keep the

702
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,290
blood running through us to make sure we

703
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:33,210
stay awake in the food coma after work

704
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:37,290
after lunch and Malena was walking past

705
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,720
and somebody said to her the only thing

706
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:42,480
that you could say to milena that would

707
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,939
trigger her I don't believe you could do

708
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,510
it I saw her

709
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,150
plank straight three minutes my top time

710
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,500
is 40 seconds

711
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,250
she just got down and did it she's never

712
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,770
done it before

713
00:35:53,250 --> 00:36:01,140
she just got straight on it and milena

714
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:05,160
she saw the bug bounty lists that we

715
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,740
have in the office and she decided she

716
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,029
was gonna get on the leader board

717
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:13,669
now milena works in business development

718
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:16,770
so she doesn't commit code so she was

719
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:20,730
looking more towards physical security

720
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:24,720
problems and I saw her pacing around the

721
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:28,950
office for three months checking windows

722
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:32,270
and doors everything possible until

723
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,270
three months later she got on the list

724
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:38,190
now that transparency the trust that she

725
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,740
has this you will get the candy that

726
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:45,620
helped her competitiveness also very

727
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:47,910
much helped another example is sunders

728
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:51,299
synthesis god damn Queen look at that

729
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:53,520
woman she's amazing if you like rock and

730
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,970
she has this band the blue ruin this is

731
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,470
her

732
00:36:53,970 --> 00:37:03,569
destroying a guitar on stage and Sun

733
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:06,419
dust trusts me to deliver candy she

734
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:10,290
trusts me so much that about a month

735
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:14,809
before when I posted a picture on my

736
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:19,429
Instagram of this tub of candy that

737
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:23,239
the first comment oh I'm gonna find so

738
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:24,799
many fishing mouse I walk the walk of

739
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,999
giving people candy with if you get a

740
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:29,809
fishing mail and you send it to us we

741
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:31,279
give you a lot of candy for it and soon

742
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:32,959
does trust me to do that and I trust

743
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:36,619
send us implicitly to send them all to

744
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:40,698
me another person I work with is called

745
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:46,459
Kristina and she is our finance

746
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:48,799
controller and you see here

747
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:50,629
she doesn't even bother we do this dance

748
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,819
so much she doesn't even use correct

749
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,409
grammar anymore like she doesn't

750
00:37:52,819 --> 00:38:01,308
capitalize the tea or anything and this

751
00:37:54,409 --> 00:38:04,039
this is phishing mail this same phishing

752
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:06,140
mail was responsible in 2016 for an

753
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:08,599
Australian aircraft parts manufacturer

754
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,719
to lose a hundred and ten million

755
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:14,299
Australian dollars now I trust Christina

756
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:17,539
to send these to me but this is amazing

757
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:18,949
she's bulletproof I ideally we're not

758
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:22,249
going to lose any money to fishing

759
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:26,449
thanks to Christina and it's because of

760
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:32,058
the candy and constant outreach now we

761
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:34,909
also have a ISO certificate to seven

762
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:39,679
zero zero one information security ISO

763
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:41,630
set and as part of that we have to make

764
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:44,419
sure we have appropriate external system

765
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,159
documentation so maybe use hand soft as

766
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:50,618
your ticketing system order or something

767
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:54,709
like that any kind of system that has

768
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:58,880
data from our employer especially under

769
00:38:54,709 --> 00:39:00,649
the guise of gdpr that has to be logged

770
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,119
we have to do a risk assessment we need

771
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,789
to know what the likelihood of that

772
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:12,249
being breached and how costly it would

773
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:15,769
be if it was and one week ago today

774
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:18,288
somebody came to me and said oh I heard

775
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:20,419
you're the guy that takes all the

776
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:23,449
paperwork away from the teams when we

777
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:25,939
need a new system and I will gladly take

778
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:27,559
the false positive hit of paperwork to

779
00:39:25,939 --> 00:39:30,170
make sure that the teams can keep

780
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:32,479
pushing out business value I can do the

781
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:37,279
paperwork and we can maintain our ISO

782
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:40,788
set so I thank this person a lot and the

783
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:46,579
first thing they said was so those are

784
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:49,400
like a candy reward this or but that's

785
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:51,650
one week ago that's shadow IT that was

786
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,529
happening it was already deployed in our

787
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:57,140
environment tens of teams were using it

788
00:39:54,529 --> 00:40:04,420
already I didn't know my boss is

789
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:04,420
watching this he's just found out and

790
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:13,069
this kind of turnout people do suddenly

791
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:15,499
start turning up at your desk you will

792
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:21,729
be busy if you start giving out candy

793
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:21,729
like it's candy but it's worth it just

794
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:26,839
the external system documentation just

795
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:29,209
finding out that we have a system that's

796
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:33,799
widely deployed holds our company data

797
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:36,078
and is being used right now I blame the

798
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:40,609
candy and the trust when they're

799
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:44,569
influenced and if you can use these

800
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:46,640
things as well then sugar and trust will

801
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:48,799
let your negative evidence bubble to the

802
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,308
surface like Diagoras drowned poseidon

803
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:51,309
worshipers

804
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:05,410
thank you you go this is maybe the

805
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:09,940
important part here is my Pokemon go

806
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:13,480
trainer code gifts daily so we have some

807
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:15,839
time for some questions anyone will get

808
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:19,060
candy for sure

809
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,130
anyone know everything can explain

810
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,849
perfectly apparent weight work take us

811
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:26,470
with you yep

812
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:27,790
oh do you know yeah yeah like I said

813
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:34,020
you'd be surprised what you get for a

814
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:43,660
full packet below yeah candy first

815
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:46,960
always kind of first testing thank you

816
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:49,660
for the talk first off and more from not

817
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,810
a security perspective but just relating

818
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,779
to communications what's the hardest

819
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:59,070
aspect of integrating say trust and

820
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:01,750
sugar when you have a very maybe

821
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:04,109
international team so there's say

822
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:08,050
multicultural barriers to overcome yeah

823
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:10,720
so as part of my job I do all of the

824
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:12,760
education for our organizations so oh it

825
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,339
don't need the stethoscope anymore Thank

826
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,470
You dawn for lending me that

827
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:19,210
so I actually visit all of the officers

828
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:21,430
that we have so we have developers I do

829
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:23,890
most particular coding training with

830
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:27,190
them or if we also do general security

831
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,470
training and the general security

832
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,849
training is for everyone in the office

833
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:33,279
so maybe I tell people about how to

834
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:34,630
avoid phishing mails or you know how to

835
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,320
avoid social engineering engineering

836
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:41,050
attacks and I make sure I take candy for

837
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,700
every single question and then everybody

838
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:44,500
you know it runs through my veins like

839
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,819
as when they say oh I have a question I

840
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:50,380
immediately used to throw a pack of

841
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:52,390
Oreos in their face and people people

842
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,040
bring it up all the time they know I

843
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,629
we have inter commute into office

844
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,490
communication whether Oh Hugo came to

845
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:03,160
the office with his famous Oreo rewards

846
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:06,890
so just making sure you walk the walk

847
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:10,759
you constantly constantly practice

848
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:12,740
what do you call it Kaizen Toyota Kaizen

849
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:17,180
is a cutter of constant improvement and

850
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:20,540
constant practitioner so I also maintain

851
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,890
a list of people who if somebody sends

852
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,410
me a fishing mail and I'm not in

853
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,970
Bucharest then I make sure I have a list

854
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:28,370
of people who are going to get candy

855
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,580
when I get to Bucharest and sometimes

856
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:32,359
they meet me at the door

857
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,390
they don't even know when my flight

858
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,750
landed that but they're there does that

859
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,750
answer your question

860
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,710
who's getting

861
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,460
the third questions gonna get the sub

862
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:51,500
lakritz

863
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:53,770
yes sometimes even happened to me that

864
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,360
the discussion goes to the argument

865
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:58,460
sometimes the developer is not ready to

866
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:01,340
understand that what the impact of that

867
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,640
validities due to the lack of sufficient

868
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,980
of security expect so how house how

869
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,390
should I handle that situation how

870
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,570
should you handle somebody who doesn't

871
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:14,150
understand the risks patiently and with

872
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:16,670
empathy explain the risks to them and

873
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:18,730
make sure they understand that you have

874
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:21,710
their best interests at heart

875
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:24,560
because that's our job is to protect

876
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:31,220
people it's Auto break into their

877
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:33,350
offices serve mixed crowd but everybody

878
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,990
knows that if I'm going to place

879
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:37,400
restrictive rules on people they trust

880
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:40,279
that I'm doing it in their best interest

881
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,930
and if they don't trust that I'm doing

882
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,820
it in their best interests then there's

883
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,859
a trust gap but I have to do my best to

884
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,150
close that trust gap this is a good

885
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,400
thing you can do called their personal

886
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:51,470
histories exercise where you basically

887
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,000
it's a team-building exercise I think as

888
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,470
mentioned in the 7 Habits of Highly

889
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,250
Effective People or no the five

890
00:44:54,470 --> 00:45:01,040
dysfunctions of a team and all you do is

891
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:03,020
just you relay like a very short summary

892
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,480
of what your life was like and it allows

893
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,840
people to understand each other more to

894
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,400
exact in this rural area never touched a

895
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,750
computer till I was 18 and that person

896
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,310
will start to understand you and trust

897
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:17,960
you more and then listen first to them

898
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:19,330
listen first to their their problems

899
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:28,020
their worries

900
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:30,880
and compromise hi there

901
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:34,840
you know this whole deal will the candy

902
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,250
is all nice and dandy but how do you how

903
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,320
do you avoid falling into the trap that

904
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:41,050
you know people they work hard for

905
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:45,010
things they have passion about but what

906
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:46,360
if they don't have passion for candy how

907
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:50,110
do we get people have passion for

908
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:52,690
security well the candy is just a

909
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:55,480
tokenization system it's like I said

910
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:57,150
it's just kudos it if they don't have a

911
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,880
passion for candy I point out that

912
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:06,430
people around them do and you can bribe

913
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,990
them and I would be lying if I got up

914
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,279
here and said that everybody in my

915
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:13,209
organization is passionate about

916
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,450
security they're not at all most people

917
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:19,780
are quite passionate about candy though

918
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:21,609
but you just have to listen first you

919
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:24,280
have to talk to them figure out what it

920
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:28,270
is that they like maybe you buy them a

921
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:30,450
steak it depends what they like candy is

922
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:34,390
just a way to get to talking to people

923
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:37,410
it's an intro the real meat and potatoes

924
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:40,890
is what happens in those interactions

925
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,890
does that answer your question

926
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:50,470
nice there is one more you have more

927
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,700
candy though yeah well I'm a bit just a

928
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:55,509
touch I'm gonna hook it out last

929
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,470
question raise your hand don't be shy

930
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:58,840
there you are

931
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:01,120
oh god this is heavy though oh man I've

932
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:04,450
got half like an injury for where the

933
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,799
IKEA bag ripped into my clavicle it did

934
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,600
yeah brought it all the way from stock

935
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,640
it's like 20 kilos not crazy you can

936
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,549
have to hold this for a bit worth it you

937
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,460
can have one so how do you prevent an

938
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:17,170
inflation and your accounting system

939
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,560
inflation in the candy system that's

940
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:25,170
actually that's a very good question and

941
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:25,170
I think when we first started doing this

942
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:32,050
the rewards were quite low and they were

943
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:34,380
stipulated as well as it was like our

944
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:37,630
physical security five grams of candy

945
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,950
remote code execution 30 grams of candy

946
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:42,190
and that's that is quite that's quite

947
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:44,049
low but after a while we just started we

948
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,490
didn't get as much stuff like you get

949
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:49,510
there it's like when you do a bug bounty

950
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:52,209
of any kind but an external one and all

951
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:55,030
the low-hanging fruits sucked up pretty

952
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:57,220
quickly maybe all your XSS goes away

953
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:59,440
suddenly and you start paying out a lot

954
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,939
less then you just do exactly what

955
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,790
everybody else does just raise the

956
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:06,940
prices so we started we doubled it I

957
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:09,640
think a year ago and then after about

958
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:12,970
three months I mean you have to weigh

959
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,819
out individual chopper charts so so we

960
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:18,220
just started like giving people handfuls

961
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:20,230
because all bugs to us are good bugs

962
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,120
every interaction is a good interaction

963
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:25,570
and we should do our best to try and

964
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:28,060
make it a good interaction so you just

965
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:31,990
throw it at them and really it's like

966
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:32,529
300 euros a year that's lesson but Pro

967
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:36,810
Licence

968
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:39,670
it's many times less than an SSI since

969
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:40,900
this that's really cheap so I'm not

970
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,070
worried about it for the next 10 years

971
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:49,120
at least

972
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:51,160
compound interest forgiving cool thing

973
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:55,049
well thank you Hugo

974
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,049
just give a warm apart for you
