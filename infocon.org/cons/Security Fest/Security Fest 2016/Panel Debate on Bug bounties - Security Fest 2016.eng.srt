you had a good day so far yeah awesome

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,990
this panel is going to be about bug

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,108
bounties over the last couple of years

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,400
we've seen an explosion in crowd surged

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:28,170
security bug bounty being at the

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:30,750
foremost thank you finally that's good

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,850
stuff you've all been<font color="#CCCCCC"> on different ends</font>

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,860
of the bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> boundary spectrum I mean mark</font>

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,239
you hosted by Buddy Program friends

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,920
you're obviously a bug bounty hunter and

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,718
added does bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> found hanging its well</font>

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,700
only do mostly in open source projects

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,289
is that fair to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,480
found Taylor on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> no right so that's</font>

16
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,399
this explosion in Christ or security

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,140
continues to move forward where do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">think bug bounties are going to end up</font>

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">how what we what will we see in like</font>

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:05,840
five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> from now just go ahead anyone</font>

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:10,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I'll start because yeah so</font>

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,439
basically what bug bounties are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,189
it's it's a pretty big difference

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">between bug bounties and I wanted to</font>

25
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:21,059
talk with and I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,689
actually define that if we're going to

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a meaningful debate because when</font>

28
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,829
when the Microsoft who was like at the

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,908
forefront of this actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced</font>

30
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,899
their bug bounty it was because

31
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,600
researchers were complaining that

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,520
Microsoft seem to expect people to

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,908
report bugs for free and this was not a

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,210
web box this was like buffer overflows

35
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,750
in internet explorer and that time so

36
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,759
bugs that typically takes a little bit

37
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer to both fine and develop a</font>

38
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,100
working is about exploit for what we're

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,860
talking about now I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the background</font>

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,209
is seen today is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety ninety-five</font>

41
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,510
percent web services or web pages web

42
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">service is like so are we talking about</font>

43
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,679
everything

44
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,520
talking about the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what are</font>

45
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,400
we talking about sure all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm that</font>

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,990
it's now all of the above we'll see what

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,690
we get into of course there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

48
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,440
rules this okay I basically think that

49
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:34,820
bug bounties are to some degree is going

50
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,430
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> replace traditional pen testing</font>

51
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:42,390
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing</font>

52
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">but without you know actually having pen</font>

53
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:50,070
testers on<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff but it's mostly black</font>

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,430
box I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that back road for example</font>

55
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:57,239
does invites where they provide more

56
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,860
information about the target but we

57
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,750
can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a debate about that</font>

58
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,230
because that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a pen test</font>

59
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,650
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> with three Lancers and a</font>

60
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,399
different economic model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

61
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:15,090
basically no difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> acceptance there</font>

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:21,750
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people but the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

63
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:24,360
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about because my main goal is</font>

64
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,230
to like think about how do we actually

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,120
improve security overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like how</font>

66
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">can we get people to have fun and earn a</font>

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,670
lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time that's</font>

68
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,260
also good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not against that but we</font>

69
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,679
shouldn't do it at the expense of

70
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,019
actually improving security and I am

71
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,050
kind of like for a couple of years I've

72
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:50,040
been skeptical about how useful

73
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,840
traditional pen testing actually is

74
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,570
because it's like putting bandaid on

75
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,470
someone who suffers from Hema failure

76
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:01,560
which is bleeding disorder that you know

77
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,350
it doesn't work I mean one guy is

78
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,750
patching bugs that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being reported</font>

79
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,280
and another one is producing the same

80
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,280
type of bugs would you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a green</font>

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:16,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparently it doesn't sort of meaningful</font>

82
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:18,870
flow otherwise yeah it won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

83
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so penetration testing doesn't</font>

84
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,669
work in that context what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

85
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,560
agree I mean the biggest difference

86
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">between bug bounties and penetration</font>

87
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,830
tests is that XP

88
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,420
tations like being a part of a bug

89
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,210
bounty program you don't have any

90
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,520
expectations at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company can</font>

91
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,239
really expect you to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the only</font>

92
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope they have is that their target is</font>

93
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,090
as interesting as it gets for you to

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,940
actually spend time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on like Google</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

95
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,640
doing this researchers grant with like

96
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,410
they realized already that there's no

97
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,020
way for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually be the most</font>

98
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,240
attractive company to to spend time on

99
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,450
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for vulnerability so let's take</font>

100
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the good like the best people pay them a</font>

101
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:06,270
monthly like monthly fee yeah best

102
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,730
people yeah best people also thanks no

103
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,549
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like pay the money just for</font>

104
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,050
looking and I think that's a that's the

105
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest problem every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time you talk</font>

106
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,480
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk with these marketplaces cynic</font>

107
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,120
hacker one<font color="#CCCCCC"> bug crowd the problem is that</font>

108
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really like talked with the</font>

109
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,470
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say like okay so how much</font>

110
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,630
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> was spent on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your target like did</font>

111
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,950
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually look exactly that is</font>

112
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,620
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that I've thought about</font>

113
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:39,539
because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to you know</font>

114
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:42,930
do like a company pitch or something but

115
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:47,940
when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get assigned to looking</font>

116
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:50,730
at something the fact that I I tell my

117
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,560
client that I've looked at this and I've

118
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,480
read all the code and I've checked all

119
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,670
those things and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really find</font>

120
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,410
anything that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're also</font>

121
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:03,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">all value because that means we did this</font>

122
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,850
correctly can we apply this on other

123
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">areas and you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get you don't really</font>

124
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,750
get on that no absolutely no and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

125
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,299
them trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve it like soon</font>

126
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,520
Acastus VPN solution where you're

127
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,770
tunneling all the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

128
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing through them so they can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

129
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,140
start calculating like coverage and

130
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:25,260
stuff like that but but so so they're

131
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,969
like trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out and which</font>

132
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,890
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just because they</font>

133
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,020
want to be able to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customers</font>

134
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,669
that somebody was actually looking for

135
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,349
stuff this is kind of interesting

136
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,960
cuz<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could never work like that i would</font>

137
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,790
be i learned i would be like they're

138
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to laugh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at me I'm doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see ya</font>

139
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,650
ridiculous the hell are you doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

140
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,270
all right I got a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for mark</font>

141
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,219
because you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been on the other side of</font>

142
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,049
this you might say running a bug bounty

143
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,000
program how do you think that bug

144
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:56,190
bounties<font color="#CCCCCC"> complement internal security</font>

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,170
reviews so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is working you might</font>

146
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,780
have to turn it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got the green line</font>

147
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:07,440
really yeah someone do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

148
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:12,599
might have told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me closer closer yeah</font>

149
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:15,360
yeah really close so we kind of did

150
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,250
something slightly different we don't

151
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,630
really view book Bonnie as like the

152
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,820
silver bullet or the panacea yeah hold

153
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:32,520
it like that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> right here yeah there</font>

154
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:38,909
we go it got weird guys yeah it is feel

155
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:42,780
strange moving on really swiftly so we

156
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:45,150
never really wanted a Nessus or an nmap

157
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,580
report right when we do a penetration

158
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,260
test so we don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> call them</font>

159
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,050
penetration tests we call them attack

160
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,000
simulations and if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC</font>

161
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,320
stuff or if you vaguely remember it from

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,800
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about it this morning</font>

163
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,140
we've actually written in pseudocode

164
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,820
what an attack simulation should look

165
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:08,810
like when we launched various elements

166
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,300
of our infrastructure our products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

167
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:15,780
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually starts but we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

168
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,510
that with one vendor possibly two and

169
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,729
we've built like those relationships so

170
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:25,380
that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vendor it's actually a</font>

171
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:27,480
partner and they're not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> riders in</font>

172
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,850
terms of like you know they follow our

173
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,170
culture totally but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it they get</font>

174
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,330
what's important to us and you get

175
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,430
higher we release<font color="#E5E5E5"> products and they also</font>

176
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,130
get what their focus and player

177
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:40,919
experiences so we actually used our own

178
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,630
feedback culture on our RFC process to

179
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,329
come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so it's</font>

180
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,529
kind of different so we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

181
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,170
actually down to

182
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:52,350
pseudocode or other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people might call it</font>

183
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,839
a process and again we realize it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

184
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,889
going to be one hundred percent coverage

185
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,939
similarly with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bug bounty it's not</font>

186
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a hundred percent coverage</font>

187
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:01,110
but what you get with the attack

188
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:03,990
simulation is you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone who's very</font>

189
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:07,139
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your infrastructure what</font>

190
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:10,370
they may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the best XSS are the</font>

191
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,540
best SQL I or the best you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

192
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,199
similarly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do like a secure code</font>

193
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,449
review which we also have fairly sort of

194
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:20,370
not automated but follows a particular

195
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:22,620
structure you know they may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

196
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,230
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> C++ person the spotter buffer</font>

197
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,899
overflow but you actually get that to a

198
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,629
degree with the bug bounty that you get

199
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,970
the best XSS person looking at some

200
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:35,699
absolutely crazy did you never knew

201
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,790
existed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really like insecurities</font>

202
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:40,800
we talk about defense in depth a lot and

203
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,629
it's kind of similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that no</font>

204
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,309
one tool is actually going to solve

205
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:45,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything and that's the way I think</font>

206
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">book bonnie is going to go it's just</font>

207
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become another tool in the</font>

208
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,170
arsenal defender and you got to

209
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that with bhabani you set your</font>

210
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,878
scope right but and there's going to be

211
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:58,439
a lot of wasters that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

212
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,730
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're not interested in and</font>

213
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,649
then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have the best</font>

214
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,420
researchers who we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

215
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,339
in terms of providing feedback you

216
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,620
listen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that feedback but also you got</font>

217
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,480
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared that some of those best</font>

218
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,699
researchers are the best researchers

219
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,819
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they kind of skirt the borders</font>

220
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:16,258
of what your scope actually is right so

221
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:19,589
you got to be lenient on that as well

222
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:21,029
and you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be prepared for them</font>

223
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,670
finding stuff that you're never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

224
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">find but it's really just another kind</font>

225
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,509
of tool in your arsenal and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

226
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,670
deliver so much and you're never going

227
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:31,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get a hundred percent coverage but in</font>

228
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,569
my view it's better being in a bug

229
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,019
bounty program then not getting that

230
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:38,939
right because essentially what it is is

231
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,949
now you get the report they were

232
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:43,290
scanning you noe yeah they were reverse

233
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:45,479
in your code<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just didn't know like</font>

234
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,910
now you know right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one of the things</font>

235
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,110
we did is we actually increased the

236
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,999
minimum payment<font color="#E5E5E5"> from 50 to 250 right so</font>

237
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,069
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the point the guys were</font>

238
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:58,190
making is like you don't know how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

239
00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:00,229
person has spent right

240
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,760
but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reward them because you</font>

241
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,980
want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be interested you</font>

242
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,480
want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come back so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the</font>

243
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,780
things as well if you recently did is

244
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,120
where change in our client our client is

245
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,620
based on adobe air which is a phenomenal

246
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,970
piece of technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's a joke</font>

247
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,510
you should you should totally do it in

248
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,460
like no Jas stead yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from</font>

249
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,560
totally submit something I was thinking

250
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java like Java on the client that works</font>

251
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,619
really well with flash old Java yeah

252
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:33,740
flash and java 6 java 6 on Safari 6 as

253
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,310
well I'll totally pop calc what was I

254
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,110
saying so what we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

255
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,030
league client<font color="#E5E5E5"> update which is our new</font>

256
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,160
client which we've actually blogged

257
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:47,180
about it extensively on engineering WI

258
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">gamescom but we've also released it to</font>

259
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,280
people like this guy so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually</font>

260
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if he's looked at it given your</font>

261
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,510
also in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our research program you should</font>

262
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,150
have access to it right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

263
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:02,810
incentivizing people to actually look at

264
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:05,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">it as opposed to you know hiding away</font>

265
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,130
from it it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense does that</font>

266
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question yeah I think so I'm</font>

267
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,689
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the original</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question was</font>

268
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:14,689
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't hang can I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ice</font>

269
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:18,040
because i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

270
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:22,520
thing with actually racing the rewards

271
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,980
is probably a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to go to reduce</font>

272
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,870
the noise I mean and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually get</font>

273
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,960
people to look at things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

274
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,600
is interesting that I mean if you are

275
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,930
concerned about a certain function you

276
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,700
could theoretically<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least raise the</font>

277
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,979
rewards for that function and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

278
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,040
more people looking at it so that's

279
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:47,660
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really good good way to do it</font>

280
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would the potential no I wouldn't</font>

281
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,160
it would probably maybe actually

282
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,069
increased the noise because people would

283
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,000
want money did you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a 180 what</font>

284
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:03,110
yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around yeah change it is</font>

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,300
360 it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only 180 360 that would be</font>

286
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,160
pleased<font color="#CCCCCC"> circle I think he argued against</font>

287
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,719
i would i would like to oh yeah i would

288
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,250
like to i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for the audience to</font>

289
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,520
take no

290
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:17,200
at one point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my life I could do an</font>

291
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:19,470
ollie 360 by starting to some don't

292
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,520
think I can do that anymore yeah

293
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:26,350
starting some like you could do debate

294
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:29,980
all by yourself yeah how have you seen

295
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,770
his Twitter yeah it's usually just him

296
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the group yeah just fighting I mean</font>

297
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:39,640
we're no jabbing no we're basically

298
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,600
patting each other's backs I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

299
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit</font>

300
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,040
about the motivation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> bounty hunters</font>

301
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,570
like you've been scanning we're

302
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> for bugs in open source</font>

303
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:52,930
projects you've been looking at it

304
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,579
mainly on paying bug penalty project so

305
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,900
when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bug bounties what is</font>

306
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,670
the motivation there is a purely

307
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:02,920
monetary is there some altruistic

308
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:07,060
aspects only money no but like i see

309
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,520
like appreciation is is awesome also

310
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,859
being a developer from the beginning and

311
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,900
then go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into security and figuring out</font>

312
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,960
that some developers are have done wrong

313
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,300
is of course like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always feels</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

314
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,270
being smarter than anyone else like of

315
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:26,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">course it's ego ego boasting boosting</font>

316
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:28,180
but also like you did this like as you

317
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:31,120
mentioned like you did this stuff anyway

318
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,890
on companies that didn't allow it like

319
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,410
now you're able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do it and</font>

320
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,810
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to VPN the out of</font>

321
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,209
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to do it now you can</font>

322
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use your regular IP</font>

323
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:46,660
without feeling nervous like so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

324
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,000
people have hacked like you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

325
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,850
to be a black hat and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna</font>

326
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,980
earn money and like people has up

327
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,350
applications before without getting

328
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,850
money like now you can do the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

329
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,370
and you can actually get appreciation

330
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,589
like like I showed you like the first

331
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,690
interaction I had was just getting a

332
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:07,570
bunch of t-shirts and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome I</font>

333
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:11,140
needed t-shirts so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was good</font>

334
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:14,500
but I mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a maturity of the</font>

335
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,449
like as the question we had before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

336
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,110
forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like add into that is that</font>

337
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:22,200
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you think about a company</font>

338
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,780
creates a product

339
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,120
and like internally you have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

340
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,680
skills to build this product and you

341
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,660
need to like increase the skills

342
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,760
internally to build a better product so

343
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,500
you teach the team on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a</font>

344
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,210
better product this is like in general

345
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,640
of the functionality but also in

346
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,830
security and then you use professionals

347
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,930
to see that you built a proper product

348
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,360
in terms of security you you use pen

349
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:48,510
testers and then you put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product out</font>

350
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,940
there like the logical next step would

351
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:54,420
be to allow people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually tell you</font>

352
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,800
if if you got them so far to put up a

353
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,319
public application and being vulnerable

354
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,939
at that time anybody should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

355
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,160
actually report it back to you like it

356
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,460
makes so much sense having that last

357
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,980
step so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's a natural like the</font>

358
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,870
lateral last proof of concept that your

359
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,760
application is secure I would actually

360
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:18,420
like like to point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as while I'm</font>

361
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:22,050
skeptical about the the long-term

362
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:25,949
benefits<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I bug bounties I think</font>

363
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:28,079
it's awesome that it has actually made a

364
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,970
lot of companies take the step to

365
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,690
actually create a vulnerability

366
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:36,840
disclosure process yes but you you don't

367
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:39,450
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get sued all exact time with</font>

368
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,600
that said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

369
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouldn't really just go on the internet</font>

370
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,090
and think that it's your right to go

371
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,780
look for bugs in any website no it's

372
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:55,470
still like well but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand if</font>

373
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I buy a car from general ya know ders of</font>

374
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,370
course I'm allowed to hack it's my car

375
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">no if you want to sue me you yeah</font>

376
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">initially anyway it's still good that</font>

377
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,369
they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have said that we accept</font>

378
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:11,550
vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> awards but it's kind of</font>

379
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:13,589
redundant because outside of the US they

380
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't sue anyway it doesn't matter no</font>

381
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,300
you're right so it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same logic work</font>

382
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,760
for buying an application using your

383
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:26,970
computer would you say yeah I mean

384
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oracle and also Microsoft at some point</font>

385
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,010
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know really</font>

386
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,050
aggressive about when people have

387
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,460
reported bugs in their stuff but this is

388
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,990
a really long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

389
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,630
and people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let it go because</font>

390
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,029
it's I mean Oracle wasn't addressed a

391
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,399
long time ago but there they they have

392
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:46,649
no teeth no no no they're all talk and

393
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:51,870
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're breaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

394
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:55,080
terms basically yeah like I mean so that

395
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,668
part I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I agree that it's still</font>

396
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,610
good that because sometimes you actually

397
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:01,620
stumble across a bug in a web page yeah

398
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,418
and you're like well I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even try</font>

399
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,719
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be able to</font>

400
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:12,029
report it yeah i mean that's that's

401
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:15,120
common sense so I actually totally agree

402
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:19,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug bounties and Katie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mussoorie</font>

403
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:23,668
and specifically has actually done like

404
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:26,158
huge iso standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am in actually</font>

405
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:29,669
getting that implemented again a lot of

406
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases because like he she helped the</font>

407
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Netherlands to actually get all the</font>

408
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,090
banks in Netherlands must have a

409
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,340
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> ocean policy she was one</font>

410
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,250
actually very involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that program</font>

411
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,899
so basically that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that if you find</font>

412
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,000
a vulnerability in a bank in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netherlands</font>

413
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:47,520
all of them have a responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> OSHA</font>

414
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,039
policy and most of them are also paying

415
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,658
like so all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banks basically have a</font>

416
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,360
bug bounty program in netherlands which

417
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:56,669
is crazy yeah and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is very</font>

418
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,879
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're all doing on that but</font>

419
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:02,549
it's sort of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

420
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,130
idea that finding bugs is the way to

421
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">improve security because finding boxes</font>

422
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,610
like of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course one way but something</font>

423
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'm sort of concerned about is that</font>

424
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:17,969
bug bounties bring more people into

425
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:21,449
security but they bring it into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

426
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:24,120
niche area and currently I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

427
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">see a good way of getting people from</font>

428
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,039
that niche area into the areas where

429
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:32,820
where more people are actually needed

430
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,279
because bug finding is not you know the

431
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,189
biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem in love security</font>

432
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,860
security engineering is where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

433
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,779
needed and right now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see a good</font>

434
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,770
model for actually getting those people

435
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:50,910
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I'm a little bit afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

436
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:52,650
if you come from a country like<font color="#E5E5E5"> India or</font>

437
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,810
something where you don't make a lot of

438
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:58,860
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and you make a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

439
00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:01,889
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you want having a reason to</font>

440
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:05,669
move on no to something else which I'm

441
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:08,190
I'm a little bit worried about but I

442
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this can be solved but everyone</font>

443
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:15,840
has to actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve security</font>

444
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:18,000
as long as we're stuck in in like I find

445
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,189
bugs I make more money than you do and I

446
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,110
work less and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more fun like what</font>

447
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,910
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about you by using google</font>

448
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,939
google had this thing where you get

449
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:29,160
patch rewards like when you actually do

450
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,010
patches you get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for for the</font>

451
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,800
bug ya like what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think and</font>

452
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,960
Microsoft has also has one where is Sam

453
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:41,129
looks yeah yeah if if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

454
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,350
improve a homosexual miss ya securely

455
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:47,400
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you also get money yeah</font>

456
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:52,830
this is the way forward this is much

457
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:56,400
harder yeah what would you yeah but I

458
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:59,399
mean someone like like like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

459
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,100
all I say being<font color="#CCCCCC"> regular easy from gr</font>

460
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,350
security he should get tons of money

461
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:09,419
yeah he's done so much work which is

462
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">really underappreciated yeah and he he</font>

463
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,800
is like I will not develop an expert in

464
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,889
my life because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's lame it doesn't</font>

465
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">really help anyone know so i really</font>

466
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,700
think that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really premiering</font>

467
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,899
the people that we should that be

468
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:27,330
sharing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we could all do a</font>

469
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,340
little bit better yeah but they always

470
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,929
say like being in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red team is easy</font>

471
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,070
the blue team is the heart thing yeah

472
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:38,580
like preventing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think if you're from</font>

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:43,379
North and Berg<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hero is going to do a</font>

474
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:47,629
talk next<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday was about how to make</font>

475
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:53,180
defense as far as orphans you should all

476
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:57,470
go there this was not planned to feel

477
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:59,250
good pitch but it is still so yeah

478
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,350
that's

479
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,910
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

480
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,929
something no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he could just come</font>

481
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:10,200
work a riot<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yeah right wow that would</font>

482
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:12,600
make defense more exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

483
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,360
if anyone didn't hear that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

484
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to come work it right but he actually</font>

485
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,409
has a valid point I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

486
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:24,450
actually have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> work it right but</font>

487
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,420
you could try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement what riot and</font>

488
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Etsy and yet a few others are doing and</font>

489
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,680
it will be really fun those guys are the

490
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,380
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean but do you haven't that's a</font>

491
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:38,010
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument also because a lot of my</font>

492
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,650
like bug hunting friends a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

493
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:43,170
has gained jobs being on the blue side

494
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,080
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> like bit pork for example he he</font>

495
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at Tesla and his job is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

496
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,040
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find bugs with Tesla he's</font>

497
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,250
actually doing stuff to prevent bugs so

498
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,320
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's also a way in two like I'm</font>

499
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,770
I tell this was for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who already</font>

500
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,100
knew this stuff yeah but I I know a

501
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,900
bunch of like people that like joined in

502
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,689
through the bug bounty and then got

503
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,640
recruited two like Facebook team like

504
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,230
what like the biggest guys in the

505
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,480
facebook security team or guys that

506
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">hacked facebook like found bugs in it</font>

507
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,280
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so so there's a bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

508
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,229
that gets to the other side just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

509
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,560
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bug bounty and they get</font>

510
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,000
recruited<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz of that so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

511
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,490
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because the quality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

512
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,650
their report right yeah it's not just

513
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,930
about hairs of vulnerability here's no

514
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,970
no there are a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

515
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:35,130
actually go hey here's how I would fix

516
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,350
it that we genuinely have seen a lot of

517
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,880
those discussions like so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> talent is</font>

518
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,250
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the interest is out there</font>

519
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
yeah it's just that they're not

520
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily the people that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

521
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">tweet or like you know do a CFP for</font>

522
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:51,989
defcon or like oh hey you I dropped

523
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,190
another Oh day we go but like the talent

524
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:56,190
is actually out there and there are

525
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,990
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that file amazing reports and</font>

526
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,970
then actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into a genuine</font>

527
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,430
discussion that goes on for ages with

528
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,980
the engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> like watching both sides</font>

529
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,510
learn I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is actually</font>

530
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,600
really important that's something that I

531
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,690
want

532
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,510
to include it in my talk but really get

533
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,960
in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is mainly do about my</font>

534
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:18,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">open-source auditing stuff that it's not</font>

535
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,630
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding the box it's about</font>

536
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,000
reporting them in a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font>

537
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:27,549
someone fix more than just a bug<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

538
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,530
in a lot of cases you're what you're

539
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:35,110
actually finding is a pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah of of</font>

540
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:38,980
not actually developing or engineering

541
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:43,270
your your application in in in a safe

542
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:45,340
way so if you so as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter most</font>

543
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:48,010
and this is I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

544
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,480
down to what I reported to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them but</font>

545
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,350
they've actually made you know several

546
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,419
changes in regards to design which is

547
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,000
the best way to fix things because

548
00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:00,159
you're actually mitigating things that

549
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,799
haven't even been<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced yeah which</font>

550
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like the way to go and this is</font>

551
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,760
something if you want to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

552
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:08,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bug bounty and you're gonna report</font>

553
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,929
stuff don't just find a bug and then

554
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,750
report it as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can with a</font>

555
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,700
minimal amount of information which you

556
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">will probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do anyway because it's</font>

557
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the IOT thing its first to</font>

558
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,360
market if you don't report it first you

559
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,889
won't get the money yeah but it depends

560
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,408
though yeah they're different different

561
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:29,169
but I do if you can actually report it

562
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:34,659
and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know analyze the root</font>

563
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:38,080
cause and actually suggest a like what

564
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:41,590
they should be doing instead not just

565
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,629
one line use a random string just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

566
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:47,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">know actually you know check what what</font>

567
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:49,360
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know random number</font>

568
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,220
generators does this language have

569
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,168
because a lot of languages have pretty

570
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,610
crappy random number generators which

571
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:59,620
will only introduce another bug so the

572
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,139
main goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of actually reporting bugs</font>

573
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:05,709
should be to not fix the bargain to fix

574
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,870
the root cause of the bug and this is

575
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I fear also it's like</font>

576
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:13,239
often<font color="#CCCCCC"> missing in bio boundaries because</font>

577
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:16,870
of the I'm have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> report it first yeah</font>

578
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,900
so but that's less like an economic

579
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,459
issue more than yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else</font>

580
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,590
there's some differences like some

581
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,170
companies they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

582
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,270
report twice and they will pick the one

583
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:29,820
that wrote the best report which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font>

584
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,010
of like they like you wrote it best you

585
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the first one but you wrote the</font>

586
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,580
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> review actually understood</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

587
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:40,140
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually understood the buggy</font>

588
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:43,020
and what so how do you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you said</font>

589
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you get really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good reports what</font>

590
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:53,660
are your rates you like bad reports good

591
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:56,970
report I I need an exact figure yeah

592
00:26:53,660 --> 00:27:00,000
like this is going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my blog actual</font>

593
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:02,430
percentage like how much noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Brazil</font>

594
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,590
park figure yeah I think it I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

595
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:08,190
the start a vast<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of it was</font>

596
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:12,780
noise definitely a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of clickjacking a</font>

597
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:15,390
lot of Allah you know automated reply is

598
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,910
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> clip herbs cancer yes not so much</font>

599
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:21,240
burps<font color="#CCCCCC"> gun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like dirt Buster little</font>

600
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:24,300
bear buster you know like free Nessus

601
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,810
really not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> n mop but like got stuff</font>

602
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,700
that's easier than NM up so if someone

603
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,280
thinks that I'm maps heart that probably

604
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,090
gives you an indication of their skill

605
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:39,510
level yeah so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as things have</font>

606
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:42,149
calmed down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's mostly the better</font>

607
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,790
researchers that are in our program but

608
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:47,190
we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a little bit of exclusivity</font>

609
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:50,040
because we have a private program ours

610
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:52,560
isn't public so you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be invited</font>

611
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,530
into the program in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case I would</font>

612
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:59,159
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a traditional</font>

613
00:27:54,530 --> 00:28:02,220
pen test<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's crowd-sourced but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't</font>

614
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,200
agree well I'd say no because you can

615
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,210
still find something but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still went</font>

616
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,220
public with the blog post so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're our</font>

617
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,320
public but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you still need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

618
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,360
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should email you guys to get an</font>

619
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">invite yeah but like if someone emails</font>

620
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,110
us and they're not in hacker one program

621
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,590
we're not going to go off look<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

622
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,750
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup submitted through that</font>

623
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,060
way and then we'll make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

624
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">person is a quality researcher and if</font>

625
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:30,330
the person is much more noise<font color="#CCCCCC"> than Santa</font>

626
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,100
than actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact we'll work with them</font>

627
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,449
we'll give them feedback

628
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,428
then if you don't improve we'll kick

629
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,770
them out this is also something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

630
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:40,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not you know an issue</font>

631
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:43,830
for me personally but I think it's kind

632
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it's kind of sad because this is in</font>

633
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,909
the industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I work in and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

634
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,220
care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot but I saw this</font>

635
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,799
presentation by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google guy who handles</font>

636
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,990
their vulnerability rewards program what

637
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,940
is called and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like over ninety</font>

638
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,179
one-percent it's like yeah I'm sorry

639
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:03,620
this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a terribly</font>

640
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:06,210
high figure it's very common<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge a</font>

641
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,070
someone from hacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> once said that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

642
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,710
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on some you know machine</font>

643
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">learning algorithms to reduce that and I</font>

644
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,510
think oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean economically</font>

645
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,908
speaking that's one way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but if</font>

646
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have it an industry</font>

647
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:22,799
that actually knows what they're doing

648
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,840
we should we that out yeah yeah on

649
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,730
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> level but I mean Google were</font>

650
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,820
able to wait it out because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are a</font>

651
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:32,250
private program yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it agree Google</font>

652
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,210
team did a cool thing they they got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

653
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:39,120
guy that started reporting like unlike

654
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:41,520
very very like non interesting reports

655
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,280
so they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> daily like this they emailed</font>

656
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,679
him and said can we do a skype like one

657
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,350
hour skype together and they call them

658
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,150
up and spend one hour with them

659
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,428
explaining exactly what they were

660
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,350
interested in like this is this and that

661
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:57,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">like look for this like if you can find</font>

662
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,780
this that will be awesome this hour

663
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,370
resulted in him being one of the top

664
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,809
ranked hackers of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

665
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,840
vulnerability problems that I think he's

666
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:08,520
actually number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two yeah yeah good yeah</font>

667
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,860
so they like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we spend one</font>

668
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,960
hour with him and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just ah that's the</font>

669
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,600
things you gonna you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

670
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,720
and he was like super having read their

671
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,899
scope I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of find it hard to I mean</font>

672
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,720
how can you misinterpret that I mean you

673
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,760
just wanted I don't know he's not rocket

674
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,220
surgery no but he he needed to do

675
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,890
surgery yes yeah he needed some nice

676
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,360
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> harder than rockets I</font>

677
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,760
am

678
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,010
science brain surgery brain surgery

679
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,890
science rain science rocket surgery

680
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,960
rocket surgery turns out of beer batter

681
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,940
your science actually exists a rocket

682
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,500
surgery is much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun yeah rocket</font>

683
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,030
surgery I think we'll get surgery<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

684
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah I'm gonna</font>

685
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:52,020
fill up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the but I mean there's the</font>

686
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,309
Freelon must decision or something yeah

687
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,010
that sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like something he was like</font>

688
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:58,110
no time for that pass it off but now

689
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:00,570
you're now you're just talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

690
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,610
different ways to learn stuff like some

691
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,129
people understand stuff by reading he

692
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:07,320
learned more about talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

693
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,090
guys for an hour I agree to a certain

694
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,460
degree but 90 more than ninety

695
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,980
one-percent is more laziness and hoping

696
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:17,610
to get paid than absolutely than that I

697
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,549
think and we should I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would I</font>

698
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:23,040
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually impacted</font>

699
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:25,918
by this but if I was running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bug</font>

700
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,668
bounty program and I had that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

701
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,679
noise ratio I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually suggest to</font>

702
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:34,620
my bug bounty platform that they would

703
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:41,070
like implement some sort of if you if

704
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:43,379
your ratio is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9221 yeah something</font>

705
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">then then then then you're banned for a</font>

706
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,760
month yeah yeah absolutely because once

707
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,280
one program had a class<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font>

708
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,400
best solution to this one program had

709
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,649
this really long description and far

710
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,540
down in the description it said if you

711
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't include the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> word orange in your</font>

712
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">report it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get automatically</font>

713
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,250
cancelled so they had to read the whole

714
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,500
policy and they had an automation like

715
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,330
if the word orange is not there cancel

716
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,910
the reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a teacher did</font>

717
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,100
something similar where like you have to

718
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,960
read everything before you start and it

719
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,149
said well at least go and then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

720
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,799
end yeah it said don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do anything of</font>

721
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> above and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone started doing</font>

722
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:24,360
yeah and we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing so</font>

723
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,220
we're hated that teacher we're all

724
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,209
idiots yeah it's gonna be but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

725
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:32,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that probably works somehow in some</font>

726
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,799
sense I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see their noise</font>

727
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:38,100
ratio on reports that has the word

728
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,600
orange and is noise I would love that so

729
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,850
mark which color you are is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

730
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,800
going to pick for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their reporting it's</font>

731
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,899
gonna be orange or red or what are you

732
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,450
gonna go with

733
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:50,449
probably green green irish green yeah oh

734
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,580
my god that's cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right cool it's</font>

735
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:56,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">about time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to wrap this up actually that</font>

736
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:58,369
was 35 40 minutes that flew by we have

737
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:00,918
time for one or two questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

738
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:02,178
crowd if there's any out there is one

739
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:07,909
here all right I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run down</font>

740
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:10,879
with a mic at that you just spoke about

741
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:12,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cancelling your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to report</font>

742
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:16,039
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like half a month if the noise is</font>

743
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:18,678
too high noise the signal ratio you pawn

744
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:21,408
just did that and it was very ill

745
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,239
received in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community to the point</font>

746
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:24,919
where they've just the last week ago

747
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:27,919
they've gone back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> retroactively Lee</font>

748
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:29,570
paid researchers money for other stuff

749
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they found would you like to do</font>

750
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:36,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">another 180 I mean I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really know</font>

751
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:38,718
what the background storage this was but

752
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:43,820
i think i<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember seeing something</font>

753
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:45,950
about them changing their scope yeah

754
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so in that case it doesn't really</font>

755
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,989
apply because they are actually behaving

756
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,999
they're not actually living up to their

757
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:54,830
word they said that this and this and

758
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:56,239
this and this is in our scope people

759
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">reported that and they removed it from</font>

760
00:33:56,239 --> 00:34:01,999
the scope and<font color="#CCCCCC"> set noise that is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

761
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:05,509
that is not the researchers fault<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

762
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:09,020
actually I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna I mean that</font>

763
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:12,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's beside the point but so in that</font>

764
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:15,469
case in know if they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a platform</font>

765
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:19,038
that might happen automatically but that

766
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:20,868
could be revoked manually and but I

767
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,849
think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of it is communication I</font>

768
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:26,179
think what a lot of companies don't do

769
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:27,980
is actually communicate correctly so

770
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:29,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully no one will disagree but I</font>

771
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,329
think we actually make a really concrete

772
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:34,730
effort on communicating there are people

773
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:37,909
in this room huge bug bounties I have

774
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:40,069
rejected and we had a very fruitful and

775
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,809
honest discussion and I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

776
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:43,849
it is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were upfront and honest</font>

777
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:46,039
and we took the feedback on and they

778
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:48,700
took their feedback and ultimately the

779
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:51,260
bug bounty program got better for it

780
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:52,848
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's really down to</font>

781
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,520
communication I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

782
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:56,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize too that riot introduced their</font>

783
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,259
bug bounty program

784
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,420
you had an application security program

785
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,819
you had something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel or</font>

786
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,319
you had something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feed it into which</font>

787
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:06,119
a lot of people don't a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

788
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:08,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">just start bug bounty programs because</font>

789
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,619
hey this sounds like an easy way to have

790
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:13,558
a pen test and then you know it's

791
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:18,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually like my my example with the</font>

792
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:20,670
band-aids and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hemophilia that 11 on on</font>

793
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,319
the one side you're putting on band-aids

794
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:26,069
and on the other side you're still

795
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:28,920
bleeding today so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it one guy</font>

796
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:30,630
at ebay actually like<font color="#CCCCCC"> eBay was really</font>

797
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,539
very connected to paypal this is selling

798
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,549
Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> dayson ebay and not not not actually</font>

799
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit no but he was working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the blue</font>

800
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:39,839
team at<font color="#CCCCCC"> eBay ok and I talked with him</font>

801
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,690
and because ebay back then was very

802
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,369
connected to paypal and paypal ran a bug

803
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,819
bounty program but there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

804
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:50,039
assets on paypal that could be accessed

805
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:52,319
by ebay and ebay did not run a bug

806
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,510
bounty program so it was a really like

807
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,640
interest conflict of interest in that

808
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,430
sense where we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to utilize</font>

809
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,759
stuff on eBay which nobody reported and

810
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:04,890
and then my chain yeah absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

811
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:06,599
but the interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> was I talked</font>

812
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">with him and like why the hell do you</font>

813
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,710
don't use like why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a bug</font>

814
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,809
bounty and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was he</font>

815
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,420
was like you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> will happen like</font>

816
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:17,940
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get like a report with an XSS</font>

817
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,269
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you</font>

818
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,160
insert this in this input box and

819
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:25,200
there's an XSS and what would happen is

820
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,660
that the security team here we'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

821
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,029
the developer and say this input box has

822
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,129
an exercise and what will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

823
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:34,890
developer will fix that input box that's

824
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,720
a really good reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

825
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,150
I won't be there for you have something

826
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,788
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed it exactly so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened then</font>

827
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:44,039
is then you have 34 other input boxes

828
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:45,779
that nobody cared about and then it will

829
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:49,710
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an infinite wheel of like</font>

830
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:51,660
throwing out money and like not caring

831
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,849
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their not getting no facing the</font>

832
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,920
design issue that's the best we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

833
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:58,470
courses it's important so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that's</font>

834
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,980
that's that's also something that I feel

835
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:04,169
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the entrepreneurism if</font>

836
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,119
that's a word in bug bounties is

837
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,700
actually if I'm if I'm allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

838
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,280
cynical<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have had three beers so I'm</font>

839
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,359
allowed

840
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,240
cynical is actually taking advantage of

841
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,770
people's poor security practices instead

842
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,779
of actually helping them improve their

843
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,730
security practices which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like</font>

844
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,340
either but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem that I</font>

845
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,670
existed long I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a penetrating</font>

846
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,840
I very much think it's the

847
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,750
responsibility of the company not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

848
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,950
researchers though it is but we are

849
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,450
supposed to be the subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>
