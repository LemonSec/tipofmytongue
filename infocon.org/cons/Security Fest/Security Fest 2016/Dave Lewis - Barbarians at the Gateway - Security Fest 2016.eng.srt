00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,549
so today i am here to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:07,770
distributed denial of service and web

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,870
attacks in general and i'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the perspective of the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,919
collect on our platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> i already know</font>

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,088
the answer this question going to ask it

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,920
anyway is there anybody in this room

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has not been online in the last 30</font>

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,640

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,619
log files as a result of our platform a

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,000
takamine now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely not a</font>

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,948
vendor pitch<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to make that very</font>

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,060
clear but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be talking about the</font>

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,840
data that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have collected from our</font>

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,839
platform so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you saying I have been</font>

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,059
doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things before I</font>

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,570
actually made it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this stage I spent</font>

18
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">two decades as a defender during that</font>

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,020
time I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything from doing pen</font>

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,210
test fire allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> men to enacting see so</font>

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have the scar tissue to prove it</font>

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,460
it's amazing how many people are gunning

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,320
for you when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a CSO role as</font>

24
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,800
well along the lines one of the things

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I learned back and back when the</font>

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,559
world was flat I used to work for a

27
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,199
record company and when I was at that

28
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,399
record company my mentor at the time he

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,750
said one of the things you want to do is

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">always carry a notebook with you and</font>

31
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,049
write down everything you learn or have

32
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,369
to remember so after several decades

33
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:17,850
several decades a few decades a couple

34
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,130
decades anyway I'm old of all these

35
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,839
stories it really has given me a

36
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,908
treasure trove of information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,950
pull on to write for various

38
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,240
publications like CSO online and Forbes

39
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,240
not that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> written for them in about</font>

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,770
six months but you know and as a result

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,149
it gives me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opportunity to actually</font>

42
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,380
share these sort of stories with folks

43
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,670
like yourselves so I really do

44
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,560
appreciate the opportunity to be able to

45
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,900
stand here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and prattle on to talking to</font>

46
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,970
you so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying I do work for</font>

47
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,070
akamai technologies now I've been here

48
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">for three years and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my first</font>

49
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,740
real foray into the vendor space and

50
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,210
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing in that in my role</font>

51
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,798
in addition to doing this sort of thing

52
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,329
I get to go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,770
customers about their problems I don't

54
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,270
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about their HR I don't</font>

55
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,829
have to worry about their budgets all

56
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,479
these sort of things that used to be

57
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,469
absolute nightmares for me for a couple

58
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">of decades and that brings me here and</font>

59
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:09,060
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really a beautiful cydia so I do</font>

60
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,370
appreciate the opportunity now as a

61
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,520
result of what I do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> travel an insane</font>

62
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,770
amount of time

63
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,320
and about a week<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I was in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> New</font>

64
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,120
Orleans<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the United States as I was</font>

65
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,859
coming in to<font color="#CCCCCC"> land this thing really</font>

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
jumped out at me I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh yeah nice</font>

67
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,650
picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a boat and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> God just</font>

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,090
take a picture as the planes coming in

69
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:30,160
to land then I realized we found<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

70
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and for those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who can't see it</font>

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,140
there's Nemo<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this really struck me</font>

72
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,000
as this is really apt to what I want to

73
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,200
talk about because one of the things

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,100
that drives me crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you're</font>

75
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,480
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media that and wearing</font>

76
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,280
that hat myself I've made this mistake

77
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,859
before where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get swept up in the</font>

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,160
fear uncertainty and doubt and it tends

79
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come across that oh you have to be</font>

80
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,910
afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this you have to be afraid of</font>

81
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and unfortunately that's the wrong</font>

82
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,150
message that we want to be imparting we

83
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,710
want people to do a better job of

84
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,900
security a better job of<font color="#CCCCCC"> protecting</font>

85
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,200
their enterprises as well as their own

86
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,510
personal data but being swept up in the

87
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">fear uncertainty and doubt unfortunately</font>

88
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,840
sort of clouds a message and having

89
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,560
people afraid as opposed to educated

90
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,120
really doesn't further the cause so as a

91
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,740
result of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories i find myself</font>

92
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,640
shouting at clouds a lot and I thought

93
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,890
this was rather apt that we've been

94
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,130
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the same things for a</font>

95
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:31,000
couple of decades so now with the advent

96
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,680
of Internet of Things everybody wants to

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,750
put an internet connection on every

98
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,700
single device they roll out there I've

99
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,220
seen coffee makers I've seen toasters

100
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,869
that were online if you search that

101
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,880
wonderful thing called showdown you will

102
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,709
actually find a toaster in Brazil<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

103
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,230
is apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> online I don't know that</font>

104
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,250
it's real because I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a</font>

105
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,670
internet-connected toaster from hamilton

106
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,800
beach but if it's a troll well done so

107
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,750
this sort of information is you know

108
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,880
leads to all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories and these</font>

109
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,250
stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get me upset because it</font>

110
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,410
tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have us focusing on the wrong</font>

111
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,970
things so we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

112
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,590
direction to worry about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

113
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,680
issue meanwhile the security issue is

114
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:12,610
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> right behind us and see if this</font>

115
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,220
works yes so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

116
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely terrified my two-year-old</font>

117
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,940
about a month ago we're at a

118
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,649
recreational park and this plastic thing

119
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,600
was standing there doing its roaring<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

120
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:25,060
all that sort of thing my son was

121
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,350
terrified he loves toy dinosaurs all of

122
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,920
a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> now he loves the diploid are</font>

123
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:32,890
it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than t-rex no thanks to</font>

124
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,140
this thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort of thing he</font>

125
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,669
was afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the wrong thing and this</font>

126
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,770
is what I worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about when we're having</font>

127
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this sort of discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

128
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,280
focusing on the wrong things in the fear

129
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,990
uncertainty and doubt and the evil

130
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,880
hackers and all that sort of nonsense I

131
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,650
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could use the term attackers</font>

132
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,320
because it shows the criminal intent

133
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,239
hackers got a whole room full of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them in</font>

any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or form you cut it and i</font>

137
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,510
those lines you<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we're</font>

139
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that makes me crazy is</font>

140

that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a perfect example my friend</font>

141
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,460
Eddie mais did this graphic for me this

142
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,159
is his interpretation of a cyber

143
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,979
pathogen now the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the United</font>

they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> break into could</font>

146
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:25,060
contain a dormant cyber pathogen what

147
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,470
that mmm so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing that</font>

148
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,380
really gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> me crazy and it really</font>

149
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,270
leaves me wanting from how we're

150
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,150
collectively doing a job of getting the

151
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,229
message out so what I'm going to do

152
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,340
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go through and I'm</font>

153
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about briefly about some</font>

154
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,140
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker actors for other</font>

155
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,130
attackers tools trends and you know what

156
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:47,010
are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that we can do</font>

157
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:49,780
and yes in a non vendor sort of way so

158
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,099
one of the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that got me at</font>

159
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,559
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 90s when I first</font>

160
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">started seeing these sort of things were</font>

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,510
threat actors for<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire online and I was</font>

162
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,840
this is cool digital mercenaries all

163
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,039
right and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting for</font>

164
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,190
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you can read that</font>

165
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">very well let me see if this works so we</font>

166
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,340
got the hack into a corporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail box</font>

167
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,500
five hundred dollars and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

168
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,380
forth right down to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos botnet you</font>

169
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,940
could buy for seven hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars it</font>

170
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,290
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> unclear if this was a rental price</font>

171
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,850
or a purchase price but these prices

172
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,340
were taken from an actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> russian</font>

173
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,230
underground site it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit dated</font>

174
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,479
it's a couple of years old but it's

175
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,370
there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a point that this is a</font>

176
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,020
whole cottage industry where people are

177
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,240
actually taking the time to put this out

178
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,330
there and say look you know we're

179
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,130
offering you<font color="#E5E5E5"> these services for a fee</font>

180
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,750
obviously they would prefer Bitcoin but

181
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,930
not all is not lost

182
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,430
there are folks out there like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

183
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,100
one in duration that came out a roughly

184
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,080
about a year ago and when this went up I

185
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,520
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey this is kind of cool it's a</font>

186
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,140
marketplace for people with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

187
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,780
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills they can jump in there</font>

188
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,909
and for do piece work and that sort of

189
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,039
thing the unfortunate thing about this

190
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,230
is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular site was</font>

191
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,400
compromised roughly 48 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> after it</font>

192
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,990
went live and all of the user

193
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:10,580
information was dumped online it was a

194
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,169
nice a nice attempt but who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

195
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,479
threat actors that we have to be worried

196
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:17,690
about this is the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that</font>

197
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">drives me crazy the board kids how many</font>

198
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,610
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here have teenagers or our</font>

199
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,960
teenagers of some description here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

200
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,740
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so when I was a teenager I</font>

201
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,000
thankfully we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were still doing cave</font>

202
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,950
painting so it wasn't really a big

203
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,540
problem for me but if I had access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

204
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,159
the internet access to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of</font>

205
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,500
information where I could go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

206
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,010
learn all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things with a quick</font>

207
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,900
Google search I could become an attacker

208
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,580
in the tools are so simple and i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

209
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,960
about it a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> later the</font>

210
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,760
tools are so simple where you can just

211
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,219
click like next and you're off to the

212
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,260
races you have just committed your first

213
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,180
criminal act and this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

214
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,340
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really worries me is that we</font>

215
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,990
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I say we in the Grand we</font>

216
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,539
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sense we have to do a better job</font>

217
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,610
of communicating this to youth and

218
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,800
anyone along these lines that might be

219
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,290
so affected teenagers they love to be

220
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,270
angry to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> angry I know I was one</font>

221
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,070
thankfully I played in a metal band that

222
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:15,080
so it was a whole different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ballgame and</font>

223
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:17,419
I had much longer here but when you're

224
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,190
dealing with the sort of thing they're

225
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,440
looking for something to belong to

226
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,810
something to be a part of and as a

227
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,660
result they become a disposable

228
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,100
workforce unbeknownst<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them so they're</font>

229
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,810
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a cause celeb to rally</font>

230
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,430
behind and there are folks out there

231
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,580
that will actually take advantage of

232
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that now whatever the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> motivations are</font>

233
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,810
for these sort of characters these

234
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,549
chaotic actors some are<font color="#CCCCCC"> well intentioned</font>

235
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,919
but the problem is is with a moniker

236
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,290
like anonymous as an example anybody can

237
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,939
set up shop say they're anonymous and

238
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that bothers</font>

239
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,430
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it there's no accountability</font>

240
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,580
whatsoever so you have campaigns that

241
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,859
are

242
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,930
a very noble purpose any of campaigns

243
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,490
that are somewhat suspect but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

244
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,660
problem is there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to discern and</font>

245
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,940
as a teenager<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're oh I jumped ahead</font>

246
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,069
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself apologies so as you're Tina do</font>

247
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">you make poor choices and when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

248
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,910
these poor choices you don't really

249
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">fully understand the gravity of these</font>

250
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,920
choices at the time so there that's what

251
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,420
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking about here isn't what I</font>

252
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,040
meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks that</font>

253
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">will take advantage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these disposable</font>

254
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">workforces because most of these folks</font>

255
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,010
are of an age of majority in their

256
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,240
country that they happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> redesign</font>

257
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">against so or below the age of majority</font>

258
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,720
rather and as a result if they happen to

259
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,310
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrested for whatever their</font>

260
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,220
activities are the likelihood<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them at</font>

261
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,109
doing any sort of serious prison time is

262
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,840
drastically reduced simply by virtue of

263
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:47,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact of their legal premise of their</font>

264
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:49,340
own legal structure now the one that

265
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">really gets me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is the one that</font>

266
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,200
the media loves to get in a lather about

267
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,540
are the nation state actors we get so

268
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,400
wrapped up in this and then it's a

269
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,469
cascade effect because the next thing

270
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're see so or your CIO or</font>

271
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,600
somebody's going I read this in such and

272
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,860
such publication should we be worried

273
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,410
are they part of your threat model is

274
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,990
this an actual real rec risked your

275
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,699
organization are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> making processors</font>

276
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,680
for high-end computers are you making

277
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,720
teddy bears you really have to go

278
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,630
through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at is this an actual</font>

279
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,790
risk to my organization because we have

280

companies i still call BS on that and

283
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,160
then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> your arch villains which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

al-qassam cyber fighters and this was

from a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago this was an</font>

292
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,819
organization that ostensibly was based

293
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:55,270
in Iran and when there was a changing of

294
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,970
the guard and Ahmadinejad left power

295
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:01,670
these guys stopped attacking there was a

296
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,470
visible shift in the activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

297
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,180
saying they're gone they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> repurpose</font>

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">or whatever happened to be but when</font>

299
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,140
there was that changing

300
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:12,770
the guard politically these attacks

301
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,900
dropped off exponentially and these

302
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,520
folks would attack financial

303
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,100
institutions primarily in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United</font>

at geography so they would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

Canadian financial institutions as well

307
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:28,280
because they thought we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> all part of</font>

308
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:30,800
the same bucket as a Canadian no but it

309
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,060
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting and I yes it was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting in that regard and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about a little bit more later where they</font>

315
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,010
could pivot their attacks within five

316
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,680
minutes if they're a attack that they

were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> was stopped by some method it</font>

318
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,219
was really an effective platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

319
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,630
there's all kinds of types of attacks

320
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,980
out there and you know the obvious ones

321
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,689
being volumetric application layer

322
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,600
protocol based attacks that I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

323
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">about and first off we'll talk about</font>

324
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,960
attacks over HTTP now this is data that

325
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,480
we pulled from our own reports

326
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,000
unfortunately this is from q4 of 2015

327
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,730
because our q1 data is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> out until the</font>

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">7th of june so i apologize i wasn't able</font>

329
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,410
to get permission<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that out there</font>

330
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,690
and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't going live i would</font>

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:21,290
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have put it there but that you</font>

333
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,569
that we were seeing local file inclusion

334
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,010
sequel injection a cross-site scripting

335
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:31,010
these are what the attackers are looking

336
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,600
for why because they work local file

337
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,120
inclusion sequel engine sequel injection

338
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,590
has been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the OWASP top 10 for how</font>

339
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,570
long can somebody give me an idea how

340
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:42,410
long sequel injection has been part of

341
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:44,300
their loss<font color="#CCCCCC"> subtab that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much</font>

342
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,770
right on target is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 13 years</font>

343
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,870
somewhere like that but this is a

344
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,610
solvable problem if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually</font>

345
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,400
making sure with sanitizing data inputs

346
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,110
and outputs this goes away so it's

347
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,240
incumbent upon us to actually talk to

348
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">our developers not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amongst</font>

349
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,520
ourselves but take this message take

350
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,170
this message back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the developers and</font>

351
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,550
say look this is what we're really

352
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,560
worried about this is what keeps up with

353
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,290
us up at night and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you why</font>

354
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,349
this is such a big deal later on in the

355
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:15,050
slides but these are solvable problems

356
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,020
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell-shocked and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Q for this</font>

357
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,910
came in<font color="#E5E5E5"> at four percent no big deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

358
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">shell-shocked and her plea they're not</font>

359
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,500
going away and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was talking</font>

360
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a friend of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my Robert Graham at</font>

361
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,330
errata security he wrote a tool called

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet at regular intervals and when I</font>

365
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,840
because he can and I asked him I said

366
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,430
are you seeing any sort of decrease in

367
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,230
shell shocked and hurt bleed and things

368
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,930
to that effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he said actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

369
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing an increase because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have IOT</font>

370

devices being shipped to market with old

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,880
libraries we're repeating the same

problems over and over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good part of this is we are all</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have jobs for quite a long time</font>

375
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,030

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away anytime soon so those are</font>

377
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:07,040
attacks over HTTPS now we switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to</font>

378

go HTTP and whoever was doing graphics

two this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely frustrating that</font>

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,170
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening because they</font>

work and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a better job of</font>

protecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own enterprises and when</font>

386
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,770
we switch it over to looking at the

denial of service types attacks these

388
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:33,020
are the kinds of things that we see

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:36,020
thrown at us all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time these are</font>

were rolled out with inherently broken

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,880
iterations of this and as a result they

441
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:37,350
became reflectors now when you're

perfectly safe let me go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back yes</font>

457
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:17,190
perfectly safe data is a pain in the

458
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,010
butt but yeah so these types of

459
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,930
implementations<font color="#E5E5E5"> were going out there and</font>

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,180
these types of attacks are in that

461
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,130
quarter dipped but it was supplanted

462
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,550
with other types of attacks but these

463
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,770
types of attacks are not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> away now</font>

464
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,360
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just realized that I may have slipped</font>

468
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,690
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> training of attacks</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've seen from q2 2015 until now</font>

471
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,700
it's rather frustrating in that regard

472
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,830
but it

473
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,039
is becoming easier and easier for

474
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:56,279
attackers to come at<font color="#CCCCCC"> you now the one</font>

475
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,929
thing that always gets me is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that while</font>

476
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">holy metric attacks are simple and if</font>

477
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,389
you have a site that's unprotected yet

478
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,418
you're going down it's going to happen

479
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:05,549
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bigger effect</font>

480
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,230
are the application based attacks and

481
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:08,610
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually varies from</font>

482
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,500
quarter-to-quarter between seven to ten

483
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,469
percent of the overall amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

484
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,529
and this requires a greater level of

485
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,929
skill whereas denial of service it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

486
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,279
simple to get tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> there even platforms</font>

487
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:22,799
or you can sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a little bit of</font>

488
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:26,220
Bitcoin and I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that a little</font>

489
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,960
bit later but when you're looking at

490
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,409
application based attacks these are the

491
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,820
primary vectors that we were seeing and

492
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,320
if for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of you who can't read we've</font>

493
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,590
gotta read from back there we've got

494
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,600
HTTP GET post so HTTP GET attacks that

495
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,010
amounted in that quarter amounted to

496
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,740
three percent of the overall attack

497
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:48,350
traffic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic but</font>

498
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">can ultimately have the biggest effect</font>

499
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,379
and when we're talking about effect we

500
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:54,350
look at where are these attacks coming

501
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,510
from now when we've crunched the data

502
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,699
the vast<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of attacks web based</font>

503
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:03,510
attacks was coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the United</font>

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:08,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next iteration of our report that</font>

506
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,860
actually drops a bit but this is the

507
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,269
primary part of the track traffic and by

508
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way Sweden didn't show up in there</font>

509
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:17,490
so good job now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at the</font>

510
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,669
attack we look then we switch it over to

511
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,990
looking at the targets the targets

512
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:24,720
number one target for web attacks the

513
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,340

514
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,169
that happen to be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room I can't</font>

help<font color="#E5E5E5"> but think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Nelson the character</font>

519
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:37,710
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be very us centric</font>

520
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,139
in this particular case and when we go

521
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the data where one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

data we have is insane like petabytes

524
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,730
and we were only just scratching the

525
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,380
surface fundamentally with what we can

526
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,019
do with these reports which we give it

527
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,179
for free so it's not a vendor pitch but

528
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:55,799
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when we parse fruit we</font>

529
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,019

that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being attacked the really</font>

531
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:01,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting thing is like we let's look</font>

532
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,720
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here financial services that</font>

533
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,970
used to be the big one why credit card

information financial details there is

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,750
money to be made financial institutions

536
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,330
are getting much better at protecting

537
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,740
their enterprises so where<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

538
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,549
attackers go next retail and

539
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,929
unfortunately this graph doesn't really

540
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,250
do a good job of showing it but over on

541
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:22,380
financial services are looking at twelve

542
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,659
percent for<font color="#E5E5E5"> retail is over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forty three</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">percent of the overall attacks rather</font>

544
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:29,100
interesting because why retail<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

historically not been as well protected

as financial services and depending on

547
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,860
the vertical that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with</font>

depends on what vertical you're working

on now when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at these sort</font>

of things where people are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

say look we've just hit you check your

569
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,200
logs respond and pay this amount of

570
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,090
money otherwise we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to knock you</font>

571
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,309
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet now the really</font>

572
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,860
interesting thing about this is that the

573
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:39,980
demands they were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for were in</font>

574
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:42,770
the neighborhood of about 80 euros<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

575
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,390
that seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> very odd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me at the time</font>

576
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,280
then after certain things happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

577
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,799
tracked it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and we realized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

578
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,570
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a group called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DD for bc that</font>

579
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:55,020
was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> out their beautiful new</font>

580
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:58,110
machine so the hundred-dollar 80 euro

581
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:01,408
type price tag six months later was now

582
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:05,010
looking at you know 20,000 euros to not

583
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:06,390
attack and these sort of things were

584
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,460
really interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this seemed</font>

585
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:11,549
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit of an evolutionary shift not</font>

586
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,169
that it was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new so much as</font>

587
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:13,500
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was being weaponized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

588
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,870
guess

589
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,640
a better way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it here's an</font>

590
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,560
email that one of our customers receives

591
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,840
from one of these from these characters

592
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,100
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves from DD for BC and I</font>

593
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,149
realize it's a bit of an eye chart for

594
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,669
those in the back so I'll just go

595
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,840
through it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> first offices hello let us</font>

596
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,280
introduce ourselves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

597
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,470
show you a couple of news articles so

598
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,920
you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on us then we go down or</font>

599
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,660
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> google DD for BC for more info ok</font>

600
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,810
so they're very confident in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

601
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,280
abilities at this point and then so it's

602
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,500
your turn all your servers are going to

603
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,660
under become under a dedo<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

604
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,540
under ddos attack unless you pay 30

605
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">bitcoin i can only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the US dollars in</font>

606
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,649
my head at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

607
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">527 dollars per bitcoin at this point so</font>

608
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,610
math is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not my strong suit but this is</font>

609
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:59,219
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting how they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten</font>

610
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,959
the audacity level that this is how they

611
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:05,130
approach it's a pay up or you're going

612
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">down now more recently they were</font>

613
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,720
claiming<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tax of 400 to 500 gigabytes a</font>

614
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,030
second the reality based on the data

615
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,220
that we saw was that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really came in</font>

616
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,840
around 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 20 which still is a good</font>

617
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,820
chunk a date a good chunk of attack

618
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,540
traffic but nowhere near what they were

619
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:23,850
saying so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> jokes that I could throw</font>

620
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,290
out there but I won't now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

621
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,669
interesting with DD for BC is one of

622
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,830
their key members was arrested by

623
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,930
Europol back in january december

624
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">timeframe so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have dropped</font>

625
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:36,600
off but what they have done is they've

626
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,660
established a precedent they showed that

627
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,709
this works because people were paying up

628
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,210
there were a lot of customers are very

629
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,310
publicly attacked by these folks who did

630
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,990
not pay up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kudos to them the problem</font>

631
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:49,649
was is that we see folks that are paying

632
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,450
the ransom all that does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is further push</font>

633
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,810
it down like do you pay the mob for

634
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,950
protection<font color="#CCCCCC"> money then there's no</font>

635
00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:00,330
guarantee that there are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

636
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:02,790
ones protecting you<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brought out</font>

637
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,790
folks like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Armada collective which</font>

638
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,780
turned out to be nothing more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

639
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,159
sticking a gun under their coat and

640
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,180
saying give us money and it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned</font>

641
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,920
out that the gun was there finger

642
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,410
because they collected roughly about a

643
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,050
hundred thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars us without ever</font>

644
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,970
firing a shot because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were so</font>

645
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:21,149
scared of being attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this was</font>

646
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,920
effective this in couple when you look

647
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,270
at DD<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bc you look at our motto</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

648
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,770
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a core one that wasn't</font>

649
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,820
but they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same effect</font>

650
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font>

651
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:32,399
you know pulling in financial reward as

652
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:37,408
a result enter the copycats and this is

653
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:38,549
not going away anytime soon and when

654
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,559
you're looking at these tort of attacks

655
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:42,120
these sort of attacks are leveraging a

656
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,210
lot of platforms where they can amplify

657
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,889
the signal so if they have 100 computers

658
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,450
firing a shot at one computer sure

659
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,918
that's a bit of traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if those</font>

660
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,659
hundred computers could hit other ones

661
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can amplify their traffic at an</font>

662
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,649
order of magnitude obviously it becomes

663
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,149
a lot more effective now some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

664
00:24:55,649 --> 00:25:00,508
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

665
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:03,268
MTP SNMP<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS based attacks where you can</font>

666
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:06,409
amplify the amount of attack by a order

667
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:08,759
of magnitude that is enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font>

668
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:11,460
ments their platform and they're

669
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:14,970
harvesting all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes into a</font>

670
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,009
commoditized platform space so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

671
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,740
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> working out well this yet again</font>

672
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:22,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">another eye chart this here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a graph</font>

673
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,549
showing the flow of traffic using so

674
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:29,840
ssdp ntp and so on as it goes from q4 of

675
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">2014 to q4 of 2015 and you can see</font>

they getting through this well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

688

where kids can download tools Naknek

690
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:07,439
next boom they're off to the races and

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really came home for me when my</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> because she's just started randomly</font>

00:26:55,749 --> 00:27:01,480
searching for stuff and like oh that's

715
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,559
cute now when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take that sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn something or I'm</font>

angry at life you know screw<font color="#CCCCCC"> you won't</font>

721
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:15,309
clean up my bedroom I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

722
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,990
attack somebody online these tools are

723
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,700
so simple and these are you know

724
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,409
admittedly these tools are a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

725
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,289
old but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using these as an example to</font>

726
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:25,840
show you how simple this stuff is this

727
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:27,279
here that this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool here is</font>

728
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,990
called havoc this is a sequel injection

729
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,519
tool I use this in the lab environment

730
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,860
and it just it works really really well

731
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:35,830
now let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how complicated this is</font>

732
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:39,699
you put in your target auto detects your

733
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:41,678
method sure whenever go well it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

734
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that simple and if you're not properly</font>

735
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,450
protecting your database it can pop you

736
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,850
out no<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem at all that is a very</font>

737
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool to use to further compound</font>

738
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,490
that when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the denial</font>

739
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,529
of service tools these are the ones that

740
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,570
a really simple thing this one here is

741
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:58,330
one being<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canadian we love our donuts</font>

742
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:00,668
and this tool of course you call<font color="#E5E5E5"> donut</font>

743
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:03,960
it was an HTTP flutter how<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple is</font>

744
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:06,539
this URL port how many threads start

745
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,039
that's simple you're off to the races

746
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:12,700
now if you could take that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

747
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,070
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well big deal so what does</font>

748
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,360
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like now here's an example and I</font>

749
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,529
apologize it's a little bit hard to see

750
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,580
in the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i was sitting back</font>

751
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,409
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had a look at some of the</font>

752
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,049
slides and it was a little difficult to

753
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:24,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">see but basically this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the type of</font>

754
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:26,649
traffic you would see<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through your</font>

755
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:28,539
logs when this tool is attacking you

756
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:29,860
there's really nothing that obvious

757
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:31,590
other than the fact that you've got

758
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:35,799
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon millions of requests now</font>

759
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:38,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">we take that up it a little bit to Hulk</font>

760
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">I love this one only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the name</font>

761
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:43,929
Hulk apparently stands for HTTP

762
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,490
unbearable lode king

763
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:48,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll give them credit you know this is</font>

764
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of funny but again we see here</font>

765
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:52,970
looking at the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data there's</font>

766
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,699
really nothing that makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> say seem</font>

767
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:59,269
like an attack tool other than there's a

768
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,580
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it now when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the</font>

769
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:03,860
simplification lower loyal Oh Lloyd or

770
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:07,039
low orbit ion cannon this was a tool

771
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:10,010
that anonymous put out where you could

772
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,169
actually harvest a disposable workforce

773
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:15,830
to attack a target for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you've</font>

774
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:17,450
created a crowdsourced flash mob of some

775
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,699
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of description to an attack a site</font>

776
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,529
problem was<font color="#E5E5E5"> as this tool did absolutely</font>

777
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,769
nothing to obfuscate the or point of

778
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:26,570
origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the attacker this didn't work</font>

779
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:27,980
out for well for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks who got</font>

780
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,590
you know law enforcement on their front

781
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,750
lawn but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see there's all kinds of</font>

782
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,090
you know little bits you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can configure</font>

783
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,830
and then say you know i'ma charge lasers

784
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:39,379
well hit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're off to the races but</font>

785
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:43,070
it got simpler when they came out with a

786
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:45,250
high orbit ion cannon configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

787
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,080
pick your threads output and then fire

788
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:51,169
it's really got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot simpler to be an</font>

789
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,928
attacker to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be part of the problem so</font>

790
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:55,909
these tools very very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use and</font>

791
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:57,620
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a disposable workforce if</font>

792
00:29:55,909 --> 00:30:00,139
we have not taken the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to better</font>

793
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,750
educate them so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can understand the</font>

794
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:04,580
gravity of what they're doing the it

795
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,860
really can spiral out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hand rather</font>

796
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,740
quickly then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> take tools and look at</font>

797
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,939
something a little bit more refined

798
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,110
robot was a tool that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used by</font>

799
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,840
the al-qassam cyber fighters<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

800
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,059
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about earlier this used was used</font>

801
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,760
based on a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of compromise WordPress</font>

802
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:22,519
instances and we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that WordPress</font>

803
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,169
is a beacon of security I've been

804
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,389
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wordpress site now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for over 10</font>

805
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:29,630
years and why<font color="#CCCCCC"> does that keep me up at</font>

806
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:32,269
night I don't know why I do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

807
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,559
myself actually so this tool was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

808
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:36,289
interesting in that he could literally

809
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:38,000
pivot within five minutes and when they

810
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:39,080
were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to an attack they would</font>

811
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,120
say we're going to attack you at this

812
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,519
time on this day for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this amount of time</font>

813
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,418
and they were true<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their word when</font>

814
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,130
they said they're going to attack in a

815
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:50,179
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> time they showed up and they did</font>

816
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">it now this tool was also branching out</font>

817
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:52,879
into various other pieces like<font color="#CCCCCC"> infected</font>

818
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,309
joomla instances and things like that

819
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:57,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">closer to the end but this platform</font>

820
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:59,729
hasn't gone away it's still out there it

821
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:03,749
hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been used to any great extent to</font>

822
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:04,950
hit back and then this this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

823
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:06,720
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that frustrates me when you</font>

824
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,340
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the media where the media</font>

825
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,320
gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold or some sort of government</font>

826
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,600
talking head gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahold of a tool and</font>

827
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,168
says this is an attack tool we have to

828
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:18,689
ban this w get was an actual tool that

829
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:20,429
ran afoul of a politician<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

830
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,100
ago where they said we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ban this</font>

831
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:25,769
this is an attack tool if I have a

832
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,988
hammer I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can build you a house or I can</font>

833
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:29,489
bash you about the head neck does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

834
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:31,529
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hammers fault no it's the</font>

835
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:32,700
intent that's the problem and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

836
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:34,830
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really get</font>

837
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,590
upset with where people lose the focus

838
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,418
they concentrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the tool as opposed</font>

839
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,928
to the intent it really is something

840
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:44,129
that has to be clearly defined and when

841
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:45,629
we're going through all this sort of

842
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:50,340
information in that we've collected

843
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:53,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">across our platform we see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

844
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,570
all kinds of trends developing now when

845
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">I talked about earlier briefly about</font>

don't know what it was the motivation at

859
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:28,080
the core of it but they found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

media they became media darlings very

861
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,840
quickly and I remember there were two of

864
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:39,629
remember but they did an interview with

00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:40,918
a television channel for those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

868
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:47,070
for one of his talks but they apparently

869
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,599
didn't do that so they were doing these

870
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,710
interviews with the median of course all

871
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,739
of a sudden they got started getting

872
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:54,629
rounded up by law enforcement and they

873
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:55,679
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very arrogant bright like if you</font>

874
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:57,299
look back to the email i was talking

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> google us that level of arrogance</font>

877
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,539
was kicking in and they become their own

00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:05,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">worst enemy so with the commoditization</font>

00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,600
be if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be pulled into a botnet</font>

887
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:25,230
why not commoditize that make some money

888
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,149
and they did exactly that lizard squad

889
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,800
rolled out their platform which was

890
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,760
based on code from another group called

891
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,440
titanium crew now titanium stressor was

892
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code that they took when they</font>

893
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,640
implemented they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HT</font>

894
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:40,770
access files on their directories so is

895
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,630
rather trivial to pull all the users at

896
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,800
the time and then roughly about three

897
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,140
weeks after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did that with our</font>

899
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,280
and we're like damn we could have

900
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:52,139
written about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were you thinking and</font>

901
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,600
so they were you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know farming out this</font>

902
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:57,390
tool so when I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> poking around in the</font>

903
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:01,469
tool it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting what you</font>

could do now right here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">greatest slide but in this case it was a</font>

909
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,919

take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and parse it out baseline you</font>

know arbitrarily a 30-30 day month

912
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,359
you're looking at two dollars and

913
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:27,860
thirty-three cents us<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US funds I</font>

914
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:31,560
was dealing with to an attack of sight

915
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:33,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">233 so to put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in perspective if</font>

916
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,679
you're buying a grande americano from

917
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:36,989
starbucks that's two dollars and fifty

918
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,649
five cents us less than a cup of coffee

919
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:42,689
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> day you can be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> launching attacks and</font>

920
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:44,790
these attacks usually are on based

921
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,320
around two primary components one being

922
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,570
a booter the other being a stressor so

923
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,550
first off the booter was born out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

924
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,679
know you had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video and platform with</font>

925
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,120
millions of users you're mad at one

926
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,460
particular one you would use the booter

927
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,909
to try and knock them off the network

928
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately they found out very</font>

929
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,550
quickly that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

930
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,830
cascade effect and take out a lot of

931
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:05,220
other users and ultimately gave rise to

932
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:07,259
the stressor now to stressor they use

933
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,569
this term very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifically because it's</font>

934
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,310
a legal artifact and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping by</font>

calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a stressor as opposed to our</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">afoul</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of law enforcement that didn't</font>

938
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,220
play out for them very much and when

939
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,140
you're building out these sort of

940
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,459
platforms as dressers it's really

941
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,960
interesting that they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> this term</font>

942
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,940
because there used to be these sort

943
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,830
platforms they may very well it still

944
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,420
exists today in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate purpose but</font>

throw all kinds of garbage traffic at it

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be once again but for the time</font>

being there is no shortage of these sort

of attack tools now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of those</font>

called the Big Bang booter and this is a

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually find this on youtube and sorry</font>

964

to the podcasting folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do wonder now</font>

when you're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of</font>

thing you look at the different like

00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:24,810
level of detail they've gone into around

968
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,890
their marketing efforts and the reason

969
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,080
I'm letting us run there's a particular

970
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:30,680
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that absolutely drove me</font>

971
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,779
into a giggle fit not to hit like a boss

972
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:38,609
not the eight different types of attack

974
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:41,848
they had a customized booter page

975
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,618
apparently the best in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market</font>

but their marketing untraceable servers

00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">they gone to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and make it look like a</font>

988
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">legitimate business model but then</font>

989
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,339
somebody came to me when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking</font>

990
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,380
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Inter up and they said well how is</font>

991
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:21,450
this not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legitimate</font>

992
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,660
business model taking take into account

993
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:26,430
bug bounty programs can you imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

994
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,310
years ago anybody thinking bug bounty

995
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:30,629
programs would be a legit thing really

996
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:32,670
been a huge shift so it's entirely

997
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,440
possible that these guys might actually

998
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:37,560
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto something but for the time being</font>

999
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,880
not so much now a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other data</font>

1000
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">as we're going through and we're calling</font>

1001
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,740
information we're actually seeing a

1002
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:45,750
unbelievable<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of attacks based on</font>

1003
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,660
data breaches so what they'll do is

1004
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,369
they'll and this really started in a big

1005
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,450
way about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four years ago we saw</font>

1006
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:53,369
with what we call the Vietnamese

1007
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:56,009
Carter's and they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

1008
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:57,450
take down sites using it various proxies

1009
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:59,700
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the data they collected</font>

1010
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,710
and run it against other sites because

1011
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,990
humans being humans have a bad habit of

1012
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:07,470
using the same username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password on</font>

1013
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:09,779
multiple sites so email and fluffy bunny

1014
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">123 happens to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> under financial</font>

1016
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,210
have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> but humans are funny that</font>

1017
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,890
way because we need to do a better job

1018
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,259
of you know thing look their password

1019
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,549
managers my password manager has roughly

1020
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:22,529
a thousand different logins for

1021
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:24,569
different things there's no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

1022
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:25,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever remember them all and in my line of</font>

1023
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,210
work using the same password over and

1024
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,809
over again doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so well in</font>

1025
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,220
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> behalf so now when we're talking</font>

1026
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:35,190
about these sort of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1027
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,328
see in our trap and our traffic one of

1028
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things i like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very clear about</font>

1029
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:41,009
is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play the attribution game in</font>

1030
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,779
media they love to say it was North

1031
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:47,250
Korea it was China it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it was</font>

1032
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:49,200
that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sweden but that really isn't</font>

1033
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,089
the true the whole story and when we're

1034
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,500
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this sort of data we look at</font>

1035
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:55,680
the attack traffic this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is based solely</font>

1036
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,269
based on the raw information we're not

1037
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,038
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and saying this country is</font>

1038
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:00,689
bad this one is bet that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1039
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,579
doing this thing where it shows up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1040
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:04,109
the logs so while attacks could be

1041
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from the United States or Mexico</font>

1042
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:07,529
it's entirely possible they're being

1043
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,529
proxy through that country China as well

1044
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:12,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">i remember in one company i worked at we</font>

1045
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:16,079
saw an attack coming from a site in

1046
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:17,609
China we said took the really rare step

1047
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,599
of contacting them said look this is

1048
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:20,220
what we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from your</font>

1049
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,779
network they were very<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful and were</font>

1050
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,549
able to track back all of the attack

1051
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:25,019
traffic to Brazil it was really

1052
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:27,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was really neat that</font>

1053
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:28,859
it doesn't always<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out but you know</font>

1054
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:30,390
when you reach out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to contact</font>

1055
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:31,410
these other parties they look is there

1056
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,118
something you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help us in that</font>

1057
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">case it worked out for us and we found</font>

1058
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,720
out that that wasn't actually the point

1059
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,400
of origin so from our platform this is

1060
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that we collected in q4 2014</font>

1061
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,640
2015 sorry and that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacks</font>

1062
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,890
broke out based on percentages so here's

1063
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,720
an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two customers in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the month</font>

1064
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,279
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> December who were coming under</font>

1065
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,049
attacks of greater<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 100 gigabits of</font>

1066
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:52,600
traffic and here the two different

1067
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:55,330
customers

1068
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,610
saw the number of attacks and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume</font>

1069
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,840
of sorry the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data and the</font>

1070
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,310
attack dates and they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back</font>

1071
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,840
and hit harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> and harder like for</font>

1072
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,000
example here<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one particular</font>

1073
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,640
customer was hitting 309 gigabits of

1074
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,470
traffic on<font color="#E5E5E5"> December 30th just before</font>

1075
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,759
what's typically boxing day sales are

1076
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:12,580
just after boxing day of sales in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1077
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,660
united<font color="#CCCCCC"> states and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> canada a big traffic</font>

1078
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,980
time for a lot of retailers so then we

1079
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:23,740
take that data and break it out by

1080
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:25,510
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> gaming is number one why</font>

1081
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,979
somebody got higher score than somebody

1082
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">else somebody got pissed off launched an</font>

1083
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:32,260
attack and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing so one of</font>

1084
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,600
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do with our platform</font>

1085
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,680
is anything like UDP based attacks of

1086
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,630
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't even let it</font>

1087
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,609
through to the origin not a product

1088
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,160
pitch it's just this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of</font>

1089
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,900
information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't even entertain</font>

1090
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,640
so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one attack and</font>

1091
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that 300 gigabits</font>

1092
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,000
per second<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1093
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,190
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those packets coming along and</font>

1094
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is just that millions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1095
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:56,710
millions of times coming across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire</font>

1096
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,450
and when we see these attacks and we're

1097
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how in the earlier slide</font>

1098
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,839
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was trending a</font>

1099
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,740
quarter-over-quarter this is a really

1100
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,370
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph that one of my</font>

1101
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:08,229
co-workers did in our research team and

1102
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:10,810
when you go from q4<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 2013 right</font>

1103
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,640
through to q4 2015 you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1104
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:15,790
number of attacks as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as the volume</font>

1105
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,290
of attacks is increasing over time it's

1106
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,029
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that big of a stretch to</font>

1107
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,620
think at this level of progression in

1108
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,950
about two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years that'll be a solid black</font>

1109
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:27,130
line so you've got to take the time to

1110
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:29,259
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself accordingly and some of</font>

1111
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,780
the other observations again sequel

1112
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,310
injection I keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to this</font>

00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,520
local and remote file inclusion real

1114
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:38,710
problems malicious file uploads and Java

1115
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,500
I mean my running joke with Java is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1116
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:45,760
most maligned remote access platform

1117
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,940
that was ever built still think it was

1118
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,260
really missed it today in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that regard</font>

1119
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,850
sequel injection I keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back to</font>

1120
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,610
this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a problem that</font>

1121
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:56,980
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exist if we do a better</font>

1122
00:41:54,610 --> 00:42:00,760
job of communicating this to developers

1123
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,109
and project managers i have great love

1124
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,930
for project managers

1125
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:07,509
I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through and got my PMP so I</font>

1126
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,069
could speak their language<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

1127
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:10,450
at least one out there who still cries

1128
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:12,999
himself to sleep after dealing with me

1129
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:15,640
but this is a solvable problem and we

1130
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:18,640
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job because something</font>

1131
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,489
this simple that is fixable can lead to

1132
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,308
very serious repercussions if it's not

1133
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:26,200
properly taken into account this here is

1134
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:29,079
a screen grab that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took from Troy</font>

1137
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:35,379
check it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out but look at the amount of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">another site here this is site called</font>

information security visualization of

1150
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:05,230
nobody ever claimed that they owned so

1151
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:06,940
if we're not doing a good job of

1152
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,470
protecting our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems doing stuff</font>

1153
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,210
like data sanitization doing

fileconfiguration it's all the rest of

1155

it or sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> director Cooke system</font>

1156
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:16,480
configuration so we're hardening these

1157
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:18,339
systems problems can happen and when

1158
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,549
these problems can happen things<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

1159
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:23,980
really badly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so case in point there was</font>

1160
00:43:21,549 --> 00:43:26,170
a wordpress plugin called Rev slider and

1161
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,150
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was very good</font>

1162
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">at so if you go to a wordpress site you</font>

1163
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,900
see the images that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are shifting on the</font>

1164
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:33,880
screen this is one of those tools that

1165
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:36,970
would do that the problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it had</font>

1166
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,279
was it was equal injection attack to

1167
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:42,488
take it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this was a screen cab</font>

1168
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:44,739
from a upload shell that you could

1169
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:47,440
inject through that which will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

1170
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:51,400
full control of the web server real real

1171
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,619
problem now when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

1172
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,680
look at how are the attackers getting in

1173
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:57,700
and a lot of the cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our own data</font>

1174
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,700
we were going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're looking</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">at flash card operating all these</font>

1176
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,710
different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools but look at the</font>

1177
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:10,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">cve numbers this was from 2015 okay so</font>

1178
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:13,619
we look at the CVM / 2009 2012 2008

1179
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:16,420
these were known documented problems

1180
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:18,460
that attackers or leverage

1181
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,680
very successfully<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause problems</font>

1182
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,200
because why we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a bad job as</font>

1183
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,750
defenders not a bad job<font color="#CCCCCC"> a less than</font>

1184
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">optimal job as defenders of securing our</font>

1185
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:30,070
own enterprises making it easier for the

1186
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,330
attackers we've always heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that term</font>

1187
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:33,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know attackers only have to be right</font>

1188
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:35,200
once well to get in yes after that they

1189
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,250
have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> right every time because it's</font>

1190
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,620
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get caught once you're inside</font>

1191
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:42,730
but these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are problems that we can solve</font>

1192
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:44,980
now if you're not keeping your systems

1193
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:47,400
up to date if you're not doing proper

1194
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,660
amount of protection of these systems

1195
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're becoming part of the problem in</font>

1196
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,920
ultimately you're contributing to undead

1197
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,839
armies of all kinds of nodes across the

1198
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,090
internet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be leveraged into</font>

1199
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">commoditized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS platforms where</font>

1201

1202
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,940
little bit of Bitcoin launch an attack

1203
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,010
why because they can but how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

1204
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,170
before governments and law enforcement

1205
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,510
starts saying we'll wait a minute you

1206
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:16,330
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect your systems you're</font>

1207
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:19,030
liable for that attack or better yet

1208
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:20,980
cyber insurance flavor of the day how

1209
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:23,320
can you maintain your cyber insurance if

1210
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:25,480
you're not matching up with their

1211
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,550
criteria so if your systems are part of

1212
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,990
an attack platform you could lose your

1213
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:33,820
insurance so what do you do obviously

1214
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:36,870
standard joke I know a vendor they can

1215
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:39,490
help but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to look at things</font>

1216
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:41,890
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> what like hardening your</font>

1217
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:44,729
systems sequel injection you're hearing

1218
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:47,500
a theme here get right down patching

1219
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:48,850
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes doing patching I didn't</font>

1220
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,630
like doing patching it isn't necessary

1221
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:55,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">evil but we really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a better</font>

1222
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:58,810
job of this why because most of the data

1223
00:45:55,330 --> 00:46:01,090
breaches that we see vast majority of

1224
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:03,370
them are because of configuration issues

1225
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:06,520
or systems not properly patched stuff

1226
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,839
that didn't have to happen and when

1227
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,580
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information that's</font>

1228
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented in various news articles we</font>

1229
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,779
say oh this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting and</font>

1230
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,730
but then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember that data</font>

1231
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,470
is sitting there and data will take you

1232
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">out to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> woodshed and have a little</font>

1233
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:22,209
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you because we really do have</font>

1234
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:25,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop getting wrapped up in that sort</font>

1235
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,130
of thing the flash that<font color="#CCCCCC"> pizzazz the fud</font>

1236
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,050
that we read about we've really got to

1237
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,890
look at what is the real data behind all

1238
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,330
of this

1239
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,830
and there's all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reports out</font>

1240
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:35,230
there that have all kinds of great data

1241
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:37,150
so it's incumbent upon us as defenders

1242
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a better job of availing ourselves</font>

1243
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,090
of this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can be better</font>

1244
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,060
educated to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

1245
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:45,490
environments now with that being said

1246
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,620
with our platform we do provide this at

1247
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:49,629
state of the internet com is a quarterly

1254
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:05,790
i was at HACC Miami a lot of our

1255
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,830
security researchers there they did a

1256
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,960
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wife a laugh off test where</font>

1257
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:12,730
they had to break into it our team won

1258
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,230
which was really cool and they were

1259
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:17,350
giving out these t-shirts this is one of

<font color="#E5E5E5">our researchers chat and one of the</font>

00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:21,069
things that was really interesting to me

1262
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,510
is that my ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give this talk a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">great amount of the data that I'm used</font>

1286
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:25,510
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what earlier I saw that the spain was</font>

1287
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:28,440
amongst at home<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top 10</font>

1288
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:31,420
countries in the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> of DDoS attacks</font>

1289
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,670
it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time from Spain and I</font>

1290
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,520
can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in Spain we don't have one</font>

1291
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:38,320
of the biggest internet penetrations so

1292
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,240
do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be related to test</font>

1293
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,890
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> stands I'm quite sure that</font>

1294
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,098
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually more active IP</font>

1295
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,879
addresses in

1296
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:48,440
Thunder is in Spain for example I must

1297
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,950
apologize i'm having trouble following

1298
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:54,859
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really apologize I didn't</font>

1299
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:58,009
quite catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and when you were so into</font>

1300
00:48:54,859 --> 00:49:01,578
chat with a with a chat with the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

1301
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:04,670
of the attacks I recall<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I you sir</font>

1302
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:09,319
spain wasn't at heart but<font color="#E5E5E5"> swollen was</font>

1303
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:11,690
not open yeah swollen has like at least

1304
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:15,410
twice or thrice the amount of active

1305
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:17,809
hypothesis turns paying us do you think

1306
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:20,538
the fact that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spanish on that chart</font>

1307
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:24,739
and swollen is not isolated the security

1308
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:26,559
stances of the different countries so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1309
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:29,329
think it's related to security standards

1310
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,880
is that what you're asking stances

1311
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:35,839
stances oh yes well I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1312
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:40,009
and I'm I apologize my part<font color="#E5E5E5"> def so I</font>

1313
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:41,328
tend to not follow on very well so I

1314
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:43,309
mean of the security stances of

1315
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:45,289
organizations is that we retrieve it oh

1316
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:46,460
yeah absolutely and I mean I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in</font>

1317
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:48,739
good organizations I've been in

1318
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,450
objectively terrible ones and that's one

1319
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:51,920
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things is that across the board</font>

1320
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:53,960
we do have to do collectively a better

1321
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,880
job of protecting our own enterprises

1322
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,499
because like you look at the number of

1323
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,640
data breaches that are up there that

1324
00:49:57,499 --> 00:50:00,890
we're when I had it up on the one

1325
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,229
particular slide so there it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes</font>

1326
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:05,598
one critical mistake the things to go

1327
00:50:03,229 --> 00:50:07,129
wrong so yes the security stances for

1328
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,839
the organization is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much a key</font>

1329
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,950
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that puzzle and I hope that's</font>

1330
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:16,099
answering your coat<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great thanks</font>

1332
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:19,059
