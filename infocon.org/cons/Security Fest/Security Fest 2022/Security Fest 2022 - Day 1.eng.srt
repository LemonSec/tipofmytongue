1
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,720
i love the freight lobby and the freight

2
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,680
elevator it's like because you know why

3
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
the public area

4
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,280
there's guards

5
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,880
and they're rude

6
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,319
it's like you know and they're always

7
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,240
paying attention and asking you stupid

8
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
questions like what are you doing here

9
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,160
what's that device and why do you want

10
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,840
in it's like i don't i don't have time

11
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
for that nobody got time for that so i'm

12
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
gonna go and i'm gonna try to go into

13
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,400
the gray areas and try to get in and now

14
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,199
i know exactly where to go

15
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,440
hold on it gets better

16
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,520
but now i know once i get in the freight

17
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,800
elevator

18
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,360
i know where the layout is of every

19
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
single floor section there is in the

20
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,800
building

21
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,680
and that's important because i'm walking

22
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,319
down a hallway someone stops me and they

23
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,280
say hey uh where are you going it's like

24
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,720
what are you doing oh i'm going down the

25
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
electrical closet down there to the

26
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,919
right it's like i'm doing an inspection

27
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,520
and like that is where the electrical

28
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,319
claws

29
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,280
go ahead right exactly thank you it's

30
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,680
like uh and so it just and look at that

31
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
gray area

32
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,919
it's like that's that's once again

33
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,080
that's the good stuff and you're asking

34
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
yourself like but jason is so dark and

35
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
it's like you got bad eyesight that's

36
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
okay

37
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,319
the brochure has everything including

38
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,039
making sure to ungrade in one section to

39
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,199
make sure you sell all of it

40
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,120
uh so now you know exactly what's uh

41
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,000
what's there uh and and see how there's

42
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
the mail room up there in the top slide

43
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
and i know it goes straight out into the

44
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
conference area

45
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
one of the best things about uh uh

46
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,919
elevators freight elevators they're

47
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,039
usually locked right because security

48
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,400
so

49
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
but

50
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,319
there's an internal door sensor and what

51
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
does that do

52
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
so when someone's walking toward the

53
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,440
exit

54
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,520
it unlocks it for you

55
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,240
so you just stand there

56
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
for like i think it was 15 minutes was

57
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,240
my longest acting like you're talking on

58
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
the phone like trust me it's not hard

59
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,919
for me to act like i'm talking to myself

60
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,400
and it's like uh and you just carry on

61
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
and then when someone

62
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,919
walks by

63
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,000
you hear the click

64
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,319
and you help yourself in or better yet

65
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,199
and i've had this happen where someone

66
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,360
gets out of the freight elevator they

67
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
see you and you go oh hold on hold on

68
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
someone's here it's like can you

69
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
they're going to let me in i'll meet you

70
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
at your office you don't have to do it

71
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,799
now it's like they're going to let me in

72
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,958
now thank you it's like no thank you man

73
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,719
and you walk in

74
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,200
because you gave them permission to do

75
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,799
that because you were already talking to

76
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,159
someone they weren't going to let you in

77
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,519
any way so they're just helping you out

78
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,320
so

79
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
that's nice and the best part is

80
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
this is what i used usually to hack your

81
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
companies with i'm not in

82
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,240
my parents basements like i mean i don't

83
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,519
my parents don't have a basement so if

84
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,640
they didn't have a basement i would

85
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
totally be there that's freaking cool to

86
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,959
have a basement uh but it's like no i'm

87
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,720
usually in the lobby

88
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,040
or uh like in this case a panera bread

89
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
eating some pizza it's like uh and

90
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,360
hacking on this device

91
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
but i'm usually in your hotel lobby

92
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
because you have starbucks there or

93
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,680
little cafes there so i can sit there

94
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
and i can monitor your traffic to see

95
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,279
what your people are dressed like to see

96
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,440
when your shifts are to see uh with

97
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,279
security goes through and what they do

98
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,360
and how they look for their patterns

99
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
it's like so i can do all that and drink

100
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
my you know mocha cheddar latte no i

101
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
mean my diet pepsi but you know i like

102
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,399
to sound fancy uh and so and like once

103
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
again that's what i was doing there but

104
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,399
hey but i wanted to make it more topical

105
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,040
so i thought hey why don't i just do

106
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
headquarters in gothensburg what kind of

107
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,720
headquarters do you have here that i can

108
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,000
start targeting

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,160
literally i just did headquarters and

110
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,240
said you meant volvo didn't you and i

111
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,880
was like okay i guess so it's like oh

112
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
yeah i can tell by some of the people

113
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
not smiling that you know i guess

114
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
there's some volvo employees in here but

115
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
but don't worry my friend's trying to

116
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
get a job and she said don't piss off

117
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,399
stefan it's like i guess he's a circle

118
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,920
guy so i said i will not do that don't

119
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,959
worry

120
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,480
but look right here there's their

121
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,120
harvest has got the best rating

122
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,279
of restaurants around there you do not

123
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,360
want to see what volvo's cafeteria

124
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,279
rating is that is like some of those

125
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,959
comments are like

126
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,399
they should have deployed air bags on

127
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,920
those uh so

128
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,320
uh but this is the uh harvest uh by

129
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,760
minister i mean it's got the best rating

130
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,959
so that's where i'm gonna probably

131
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,560
target most of the executives that are

132
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,480
trying to impress uh people that are

133
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
visiting uh the location and the arkhand

134
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
hotel and art garden spa sounds really

135
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
fun uh security fest didn't put me up

136
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,839
there but that's okay because i'm in

137
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,920
walking distance i'm not not complaining

138
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
but it looks like a really nice place

139
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
and it's right beside almost walking

140
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,680
distance to the volvo headquarters too

141
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,279
so that's exactly where i'm gonna put my

142
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,040
malicious wi-fi access points that's

143
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,440
where i'm gonna try to like uh uh talk

144
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,519
to people in the bar and try to gather

145
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,240
information from them uh because i'm a

146
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,440
bad person

147
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,680
theoretically it's like if i was doing

148
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,279
it for a bad thing

149
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,560
but also i look for social media posts i

150
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,839
tell people if you want to know why

151
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,000
information security people drink

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,120
just

153
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,600
do a search on instagram for hashtag new

154
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,560
badge

155
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,800
that it's like i mean i don't drink and

156
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,000
it's like i've been tempted okay uh it's

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,519
like but here's some of the badges that

158
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
you can find and i have literally robbed

159
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,000
a company once and it was in 15 minutes

160
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,480
from going to instagram finding their

161
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,360
badge and getting it printed out

162
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,839
it's like it was that simple

163
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,279
and uh some more social media post uh

164
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,680
this instagram is is full of giving it's

165
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,959
like because sometimes we don't

166
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,040
understand that you can't just search

167
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,680
instagram hashtags you can search

168
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,079
instagram locations so that means you

169
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,959
get people taking pictures inside ernst

170
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,000
young and so you get in more employees

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,839
informations and their social media

172
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,920
profiles that you didn't even have

173
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,880
before

174
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
uh so that's fun

175
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,360
and that's not fun

176
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,760
there we go okay and so

177
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,279
see i'll handle that just so smoothly

178
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,120
okay very good uh

179
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,480
but this is what we're gonna do when we

180
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
get the badge

181
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
we use the badgi 1000

182
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
the only way this thing could be cooler

183
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
is if it was called the badgie 3000

184
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,959
okay but i will settle for the badgi

185
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,800
1000.

186
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,839
so here's the badgi 1000 and it is great

187
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,399
for all your badging needs and the best

188
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,839
part is

189
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,560
why i've literally printed out badges

190
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,240
who have no rfid tag information

191
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,120
when i do cloning when i do those kind

192
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
of tools i do it as theoretical i have

193
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,399
never used an employee i mean okay i've

194
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,399
stolen employees badges and used their

195
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
actual badges but i've never cloned

196
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,320
their badges

197
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,839
it's like why

198
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,959
i will go up to the checkpoint with a

199
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,720
badge that has no data on it whatsoever

200
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,480
but it's an employee badge with my name

201
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,040
on it and i will stand there for 10

202
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,279
minute

203
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,079
this is not working

204
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,680
it's not registering it's like it's

205
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,638
nothing's there it's like

206
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,519
and then they'll usually budge you in

207
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,200
so it's like that's all i mean so i

208
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
don't know why we have to go with all

209
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,480
the the high tech you know got to clone

210
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,360
people i just like just do it that way

211
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
now here comes the best part uh uh we're

212
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,519
gonna i want to ask you a per important

213
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,200
question because a lot of people in

214
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,560
different industries and they all have

215
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,320
the same thing it's never going to

216
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,360
happen to me or we're very secure or

217
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,880
we're very locked down because we've got

218
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,199
a lot of important data so i always ask

219
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,920
them the question is do you think where

220
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,440
you work is more secure from

221
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,519
infiltration and compromise than a bank

222
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,000
which understands and is aware that

223
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,120
people will try to rob it

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,839
i think it's a good question i can tell

225
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,040
by the silence that people are

226
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,959
contemplating it now like

227
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,160
it's like but let's see uh what actually

228
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,440
happens because what we're going to do

229
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,240
here

230
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,800
is we're going to actually look at me

231
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,399
robbing a bank

232
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,000
and we're going to look for me we're

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,519
gonna look for my mouse first and

234
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,560
oh screw it that means we're probably

235
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,639
not gonna have audio but there we go so

236
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,480
we're gonna watch

237
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,040
this is unedited less than eight minutes

238
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,959
me completely robbing every machine in

239
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,000
the bank look at that lady she knows i'm

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,440
sketchy enough to no good

241
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
but i go past her anyway i say hi how

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
you doing best counter social

243
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,320
engineering maneuver there 15 seconds

244
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,399
i've compromised my first machine

245
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,600
from walking into the front door

246
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,040
payloads deployed in 20 seconds

247
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
retrieve

248
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,639
device in 28 seconds under 30 seconds

249
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,120
already compromised one uh uh machine in

250
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
the bank

251
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,880
she comes and does her job she's like

252
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
questions and he's like you know hello

253
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,720
it's like and she wants to know what i'm

254
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,399
doing it's like i'm doing the usb audit

255
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,120
because you know those are totally legit

256
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,360
it's like uh and then so what i do is

257
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,279
instead of trying to keep asking i make

258
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,959
her try to do something for me i need

259
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,880
you to log in real quick

260
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
i i don't have to answer questions i'm

261
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,839
here to ask you questions because i'm

262
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,079
auditing and the head office was

263
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,480
supposed to contact you

264
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,560
but she does the right thing once again

265
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
can you talk to the head manager and i

266
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,680
said sure no problem

267
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,759
and but here's the mistake that she made

268
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,440
it was just one mistake she did

269
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,680
everything right but this is the mistake

270
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,320
that cost everything

271
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,720
i told her i'll stand by and she trusted

272
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,519
me never trust me

273
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,240
because now i'm inside

274
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,720
he thinks that she vetted me

275
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,199
she thinks he's vetting me

276
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,240
no one vetted me

277
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
so now i'm just doing his machine like

278
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,800
i'm now i've changed from an assertive

279
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
role like the auditor like i was with

280
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,600
her now i've switched instantly and now

281
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,519
i'm with microsoft trying to make the

282
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,240
network faster and you could be on a t1

283
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
line straight to your desktop through

284
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,199
fiber and you ask someone if the

285
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,639
network's running slow and they're like

286
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,959
yeah it's running pretty slow it's like

287
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,800
i'm here to fix it what do you need

288
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,040
so oh yeah so i go like if i'm going to

289
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,560
try to compromise everything with a

290
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,040
manager escorting me why not go for the

291
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
data center

292
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,959
i mean do you blame me

293
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
i blame that guy whoever's doing the

294
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
video thing like that

295
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,360
you oh i'm sorry i don't mean i didn't

296
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,440
mean actually a point but you know

297
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,839
so here we go he's getting the pass it's

298
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,600
like uh

299
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,680
and uh leading me up the stairs to the

300
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,959
data center

301
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,880
i mean like on this thing on any

302
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
engagement i have i'm a walking talking

303
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,039
google street car i've got like video

304
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,119
cameras all different this is just a

305
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,359
really cool high-tech one that uh

306
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,280
national dr uh national geographic did

307
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,799
with the button camera

308
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,119
um

309
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,119
we're not gonna talk about how i got the

310
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,240
data but uh the file but

311
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,359
there we go

312
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,439
we're in

313
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,439
and i wish the audio the only reason why

314
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,280
i have audio on it

315
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
is because

316
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
when i told the guys that you can leave

317
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
me now i'm good i just want to show that

318
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,919
i got it here by myself

319
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,080
but right here at this moment you hear

320
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,840
me sigh

321
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
and it is the sigh of a person going i

322
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
should not have been able to do that so

323
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,919
easily it was just it was a defeatist

324
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,200
sigh

325
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,039
because i really root for the guys i

326
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,360
want i want them to do good but then i

327
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,039
realized wait that guy's my golden

328
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,640
effing ticket why am i letting him walk

329
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
away from me uh i need to catch up with

330
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200

331
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
so i get back with him and i'm like i'm

332
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,799
sticking with you buddy let's let's go

333
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,080
down to the teller line now

334
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
because i totally belong in the teller

335
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,039
line you know it's like

336
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,200
what could go wrong

337
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,039
so here i am uh now like i decided uh

338
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,039
after the the first after the manager's

339
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,720
desk that i wanted to compromise a

340
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,120
hundred percent of the machines because

341
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
i got to be honest with you it's like uh

342
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,960
i started off this whole uh engagement

343
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,280
of the day where i got caught and so i

344
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,360
was like really overcompensating because

345
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,280
i like i needed to show them big like i

346
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
can do things uh because no one's gonna

347
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,280
believe me uh

348
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,000
imposter syndrome sucks uh and so here i

349
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,640
am uh

350
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
getting into one of them i don't know

351
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,520
why it was slowing down that's darren's

352
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,200
fault it's like okay oh this is the

353
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,480
locked one how rude

354
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,720
locking your effing workstation i'm

355
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,760
trying to do a compromise here people

356
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,919
that's okay he gets the user to come

357
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,440
over the employee to come over from

358
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,440
break and log in real quick for me

359
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,799
that was close i almost didn't do 100

360
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,000
and it's like but we're good it's like

361
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
now everybody thinks that the big shiny

362
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
uh vault things is where the money is

363
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,400
that's ridiculous

364
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,919
it's like the computers are where the

365
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,120
money is but the most valuable computer

366
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
in the whole bank

367
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
is where

368
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,600
where you do the wire transfers

369
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,840
where the money actually make changes

370
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,720
hands

371
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,760
this computer right here this lady the

372
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,360
one doing the wire transfers

373
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,480
and she's very nice to let me uh get up

374
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,360
and

375
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,559
oh

376
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,360
wire transfers

377
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,320
nothing's

378
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
bad about me plugging into that one

379
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,039
and it's in the middle of process of

380
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,880
doing a wire transfer which i felt very

381
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,039
bad about but i don't think i messed it

382
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,000
up

383
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
it's like mine just does notepad and it

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
just says yeah this just happened with a

385
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
smiley face that's all that pops up

386
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,360
because i'm doing education i'm not

387
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
trying to do compromise

388
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,159
now i'm done and i'm like i can't

389
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,120
believe like

390
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,039
but then i'm walking out and i realized

391
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,559
one important thing

392
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,960
i may have gotten most out but i forgot

393
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,200
one machine

394
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
the one who stopped me

395
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,039
did i mention i was petty i don't know

396
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,280
if i mentioned that before i think i did

397
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,679
so i made sure to compromise her machine

398
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,919
too

399
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,840
so there we go

400
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,080
now

401
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,640
if you look at this

402
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
and you're seeing this it's like and you

403
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,159
and you hear so much of all these

404
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,520
advanced techniques what did i do

405
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,880
what was so

406
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,280
advanced or persistent about any of this

407
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,559
stuff

408
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,720
i used the perceptions they didn't

409
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,960
expect someone like me to be a threat

410
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
and i used those perceptions against

411
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,679
them that was it

412
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,440
it was not

413
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,919
skills it was not being lead it wasn't

414
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:08,880
being as

415
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,080
i mean look at

416
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,120
how the judge just happened

417
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,200
i was more surprised than anybody else

418
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,520
but that's what occurs because it's all

419
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
about basic perception

420
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,640
that is what i'm trying to do i am not

421
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,240
trying to be

422
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
like come up with some elaborate stories

423
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,120
or

424
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,559
trying to come up with like some kind of

425
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,360
and read mps uh the npl whatever that

426
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,679
stuff is you know the micro expressions

427
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,840
and the body i don't do that stuff i

428
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
just look at you like okay it's like

429
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,559
it's just

430
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,080
that's what so let's go look a little

431
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,640
bit more and see

432
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,480
another thing about perception because

433
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,720
this is a better example of perception

434
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,960
this is me robbing another bank i rob a

435
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,919
lot of banks for some reason um

436
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,480
but watch real quick here i come in i

437
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,679
walk in

438
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,840
and i immediately head for this column

439
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
right here

440
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
and i stay right there the lady right

441
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
there at the bottom she's on her phone

442
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,440
she doesn't really see me

443
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,080
so i'm staying there and then

444
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,640
from that behind that column i walked

445
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,000
straight in

446
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,520
to the teller area

447
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,639
why did they let me in

448
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,240
because i didn't come from a private

449
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,720
area a public area i came from the

450
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
private area subconsciously just not

451
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,919
something that people perceive

452
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,000
but because i came from one section and

453
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,720
not the other i'm able to do this

454
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,360
that machine right there is not even

455
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,880
plugged in

456
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,600
but i started the process so the person

457
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,120
next to me would be comfortable with it

458
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,679
so then i could go to her machine and

459
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,760
then plug in it uh the device into hers

460
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
and she allowed it then when the other

461
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,720
person was uh busy and didn't look like

462
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,679
they would be bothered what did i do

463
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,039
i do what i always do in these

464
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,880
situations

465
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,120
i sit down in the chair and i spin

466
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,880
around

467
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,720
because what kind of bank robber spins

468
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,080
around in a chair while they're robbing

469
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,480
a bank

470
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,320
and then i just interrupt her straight

471
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
up because i'm in a hurry

472
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,240
i'm on a time schedule i'm robbing a

473
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,720
bank here people

474
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,600
i'm smiling all like

475
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,360
hi

476
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,799
and then the lady who wasn't paying

477
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,200
attention yes i compromised her machine

478
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,640
too

479
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,240
but the key thing was

480
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
that right there

481
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,279
got me in

482
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
because if i would have walked in from

483
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,799
the public area if i would have just

484
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,720
walked straight in

485
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,640
those tellers would not have let me

486
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,279
behind the teller line

487
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,640
because they would know that i was

488
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,080
coming from an open public exposed space

489
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,159
they would not they would not register

490
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,840
that's what they were thinking about

491
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,440
they would just have a feeling like no i

492
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,279
don't think he should be here you know

493
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,960
that feeling you get like no i don't

494
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
think something's not right that's

495
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,799
because they know subconsciously that

496
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,440
that's the public area but i didn't come

497
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,039
from that direction

498
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,240
i came from a private area after a

499
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,520
certain amount of time where they

500
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,880
couldn't see me

501
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,760
so therefore they assumed that i was

502
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,840
talking to the lady right there on her

503
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,120
phone and so therefore i must have

504
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,919
gotten authorization and so they didn't

505
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,400
blink an eye when i then came behind the

506
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
teller line

507
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,159
because they didn't see me so therefore

508
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,760
i must have been there there was nothing

509
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,200
else back there

510
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,559
that's why i was just standing there in

511
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,120
the column

512
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,320
so the answer is you sure hope sir right

513
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,080
but you probably know unfortunately your

514
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,559
company would not fare much better

515
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,120
because it's like it's just human nature

516
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
and human perception that we're trying

517
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
to go against

518
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,960
because

519
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,880
the key thing is i'm not attacking your

520
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
network with technology and oh days to

521
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,799
get in i'm attacking your people using

522
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,400
their perceptions and expectations

523
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,320
against them the problems we have like a

524
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,440
little small screen that's like you

525
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,640
don't want to go like this to read it so

526
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,080
you just turn around and read it but

527
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,559
that's what i'm talking about it's basic

528
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,320
human perception we want to talk about

529
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,159
like it's training and you got to train

530
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,640
your users you got to show your users

531
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,960
you got to condition them to understand

532
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,039
to listen

533
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,880
when they feel like something's wrong or

534
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
not right and act on it to be more

535
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,320
suspicious of those kind of things

536
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,919
because it's literally

537
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,559
time and time again we're taught and

538
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,840
we're shown

539
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,279
it's like

540
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,679
our perceptions are different based on

541
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,520
different people and different outlooks

542
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,880
does everybody remember the blue and

543
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,440
black dress white gold that's like old

544
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,679
internet meme history and stuff you know

545
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,200
it's like i can see the old but don't

546
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
worry i know that may not be relevant

547
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,360
very right now so i got a better example

548
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,840
of perception uh here's here's a better

549
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,279
one um

550
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,279
because you look at this guy right here

551
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,159
at the top left hand corner what a clown

552
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,919
uh this guy was on dancing with the

553
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,320
stars a comedian thought he could be a

554
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,960
president it's like i mean i i think for

555
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,520
a joke i don't know uh wasn't very

556
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,200
popular at first instead of you know

557
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,279
when he started and then you got this

558
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,080
alpha male guy and stuff you know who is

559
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,360
not homoerotic at all uh it's like uh

560
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,520
and he's like you know big masculine guy

561
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,080
and shoots things and and rides horses

562
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,960
uh and then we realize

563
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,120
that that's a perception

564
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,679
but maybe not reality because when push

565
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,520
comes to shove and when things get hard

566
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,240
you realize oh

567
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,960
that clown is a badass

568
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,360
it's like he is like he may have a lot

569
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
of issues or he may like be like funny

570
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,360
guy but when it comes to

571
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,600
taking care of stuff and helping it's

572
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,120
like he's going to be one that you can

573
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,840
depend on and then you got this guy who

574
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,039
turns out like oh not so much people

575
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,960
aren't afraid of me as much so now

576
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,559
they're going to realize i'm afraid of

577
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,480
them because

578
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,720
if your trusted advisors are like having

579
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,440
to sit in a comically long table you're

580
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,039
going to have to ask yourself maybe

581
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,279
we're the baddies because you know

582
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,360
that's just ridiculous

583
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,840
and i use that perception a lot

584
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,240
in my things what is the most telling

585
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,000
thing about using perception that you

586
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
see in these pictures

587
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,720
for one thing these pictures are taking

588
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,880
taken 24 hours apart

589
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,720
it's like i showed up

590
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,159
with the goatee

591
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,440
uh no glasses no hair gel and in a

592
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,279
passive outfit and we'll get to that in

593
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,279
a minute it's like well i'm help desk

594
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,880
where i can do really and then when i

595
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,760
really want to start doing the

596
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,440
compromise i shave dress up and so

597
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,679
people vaguely remind remember that i

598
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,760
look familiar sort of

599
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,279
it's like because i've changed my

600
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,720
appearance just enough to make it look

601
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
like i think i've seen him before so i

602
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,679
guess he's okay

603
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,440
but also

604
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,880
look at the snow in the background

605
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,000
where's my jacket

606
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,559
i was freezing my butt off in these

607
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,720
pictures

608
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,399
but i cannot rob a company

609
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,760
with a jacket on because you know why

610
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,880
a jacket means you came from outside

611
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,360
you're not trusted

612
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,840
but if i show up in short sleeve shirt

613
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,080
with no jacket

614
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,880
well

615
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
either you're an idiot

616
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,440
or you must have already been there and

617
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
you put your jacket up in your office

618
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,520
where you're working

619
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,760
so you're legit

620
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,240
and i love acting legit

621
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,640
acting keyword there it's like so that's

622
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,720
how i do it i just use those kind of

623
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
basic perceptions

624
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,080
and these are like the three perceptions

625
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,360
i love to use the most uh my

626
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,240
omg i'm gonna just see if it works

627
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,919
uh my passive uh help desk role helper

628
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,399
and my assertive uh i'm serious business

629
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,480
guy uh role

630
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,880
it's like uh because each one of those

631
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,720
i'm going to be attacking you with

632
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,799
either strapping you know uh some

633
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,679
pineapples and stuff onto a cardboard or

634
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,039
doing a dropbox or some other scans it's

635
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,320
just about the different kinds of

636
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,399
attacks so let's start with the first

637
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,399
attack i i'll do

638
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,480
assertive role

639
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,880
does not mean aggressive it's like uh

640
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,960
what uh the mannerisms i'm going to be

641
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,840
using

642
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,880
are

643
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,120
i'm just here to do an audit i'm here to

644
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,640
help you it's like i need to come and do

645
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,159
this we're having an acquisition it's

646
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,679
like i need to do these things and and

647
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,559
i'm like i'm rushed it's like i i'm very

648
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,919
official i know exactly what i'm

649
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,080
supposed to be doing and it's like and

650
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,399
this is what needs to get done so i'm

651
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,640
doing that and um

652
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,480
i mean i i've done aggressive roles it's

653
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,880
like there's a difference between going

654
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
it's like because i i've had

655
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,240
it's actually in germany it's like it

656
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,080
works very well there it's like you go

657
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,279
in there and you're like straight out

658
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,039
it's like excuse i'm doing the surprise

659
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,640
inspection for the server

660
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,320
what part of surprise inspects did you

661
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,760
not understand i didn't fly all the way

662
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,600

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,559

668
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,360

669
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,799
oh thank you

670
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,640
i put him on the list anyway sorry it's

671
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,840
part of the job uh but it's like so that

672
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,320
doesn't always work it's best to try to

673
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,919
be assertive like look i'm doing an

674
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,679
audit it's like i'm here headquarters

675
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,360
should have contacted you

676
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,520
it's like like and you saw that when i

677
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,159
was first uh encountered uh in the uh

678
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,600
first video

679
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,720
um but the hardware i use is limited

680
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,559
it's like i can't use anything too

681
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,559
technical two things usually i'm using

682
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,679
usb drives a couple other devices uh

683
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,520
because that looks more in character

684
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,760
with being in a suit so you're wearing a

685
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,320
suit jason yes

686
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,840
and when i'm wearing a suit i'm gonna

687
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
totally destroy you you make me wear a

688
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,559
tie i f you up in the worst possible way

689
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,200
no extra charge okay you made me put on

690
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,200
a tie um and i love this suit uh this is

691
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,159
my uh suit i have a i had a tailor in

692
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,240
beijing named peter

693
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,960
and

694
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,799
that's a custom handmade suit he made

695
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,840
the best suits for me uh and shirts and

696
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,159
the reason why is because they're not

697
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,240
typical suits

698
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,399
it's like he asked me he asked me when i

699
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,799
told him what i wanted he said are you a

700
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,159
magician

701
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,559
and i was like no peter

702
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,600
i'm not a magician magicians always say

703
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
there's nothing up my sleeve

704
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,640
it's like

705
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,399
and i'm like totally there's something

706
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,679
up my sleeve

707
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,600
that's why i asked you to put pockets in

708
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,760
my sleeves peter it's like i'm not a

709
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,919
magician it's like those are bash

710
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,440
bunnies in my sleeve it's like and so

711
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,760

712
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,440
i just i just like having you know

713
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,640
little things around but also i've got

714
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
some other hacking tools around around

715
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,440
my wrist area and sleeve area can you

716
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,120
see the three different hacking devices

717
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,760
in this picture

718
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,519
i mean the first one's like really easy

719
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,679
the the spy pin right the usb 8 8 gig

720
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,080
hard drive uh high def camera pin uh the

721
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,640
16 gig usb hard drive uh and hd video

722
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,679
camera

723
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,799
watch

724
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,200
is you know uh really cool too because

725
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,320
there's a little cable that you can put

726
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,840
in it looks like an audio cable you plug

727
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,399
it in download 16 gigs of data onto the

728
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,960
watch and then walk out with it you know

729
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,399
hi snowden uh and it's like uh but also

730
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,960
the really cool

731
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,120
i always make sure that i got french

732
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,200
cuffs for my shirts i mean first of all

733
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
i just like looking fancy

734
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,080
but also because of my cuff links

735
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,840
i love my cuff links one's a usb

736
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,440
wireless adapter

737
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,200
so i'm putting that into your server or

738
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,960
your desktop unit and turning it into a

739
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,200
wireless access point for me because who

740
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,720
needs a dropbox when i can use your

741
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,320
network and network access controls to

742
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,799
let me have access and the other one is

743
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,960
a two gig usb hard drive like that's not

744
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
too much jason it's enough for a command

745
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,039
to control uh software or some malicious

746
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,640
malware and also wireless usb drivers so

747
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,600
happens for mac linux and windows

748
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,679
so it's like i can plug in the other

749
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,600
cuff link and you know whole wireless

750
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,440
access point thing right

751
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,240
now here's the cool stuff

752
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,120
my jacket also has pockets

753
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,760
ladies it's got pockets

754
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,440
you know i think one of the worst things

755
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,360
in western society is that women can't

756
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
wear pot have pockets and men can't have

757
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,279
purses i think that's ridiculous i love

758
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,519
my purse it's like so and i think that

759
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,200
y'all should have pockets but i have

760
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,640
lots of pockets

761
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,320
and i put lots of things in those

762
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,720
pockets uh i don't put all these things

763
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,399
in the pockets at one time because then

764
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,279
i'd be like hi how are you doing don't

765
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,679
mind me i am not suspicious

766
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,000
it's like uh but yeah i will mix and

767
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,240
match you know you gotta accessorize you

768
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,120
know

769
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,239
so

770
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,839
but yeah i will have different devices

771
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,760
in there and the back pocket there's a

772
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,480
back specially designed pocket uh in the

773
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,239
back of the jacket where i've literally

774
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,239
stolen the laptop because it just fits

775
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,079
in there it's like usually i do

776
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,639
documents but laptops fit also

777
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,960
um

778
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,639
so now let's go to the next row passive

779
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,839
roles

780
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,760
they're not meant to be wimpy or timid

781
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,520
uh they're just to be like i'm here to

782
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,320
help you help me help you uh hardware i

783
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,918
can use what all kinds of different

784
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,399
things and yes i have literally robbed

785
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,119
people wearing a work shirt that says

786
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,480
hacker on it

787
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,399
uh and i that is a picture of me

788
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,199
compromising a place with a work short

789
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,399
uh in the blue that says your company's

790
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,560
computer guy

791
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,879
it's like which is from snl and i robbed

792
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,960
a place you know uh right there in the

793
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,119
financial district of uh

794
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,040
wall street uh with that shirt which i

795
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,240
thought was cool and there's my fake

796
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,760
microsoft badge

797
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,599
uh because i love compromising with

798
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,320
microsoft uh they're very helpful uh

799
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,400
it's like uh and so i also have my

800
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,240
clipboard you have a clipboard you get

801
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,599
anywhere

802
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,040
but once again

803
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
pockets

804
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,440
it's like

805
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,640
and so there's one of my other bash

806
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,400
bunnies i love that one because it says

807
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,160
victim on it i always come with warning

808
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,760
labels

809
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,720
and

810
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,359
also i i come with some

811
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,000
omg malicious cables that's great but

812
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,880
the most important tool in my arsenal is

813
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
right there

814
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,078
envelopes and a marker

815
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,720
because i go by a secured area i've

816
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,119
already been in and i see offices and i

817
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,320
see dash that are un uh unoccupied

818
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,800
but their names there they got a name

819
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,720
badge or a tag there showing that whose

820
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,000
office that is

821
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,520
so i go in

822
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,160
take one of my malicious usb drives

823
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,800
put it in the envelope you know seal it

824
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,400
up nice and tight

825
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,079
get a marker

826
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,079
write their name on it

827
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,839
put it on the desk walk away

828
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,280
someone comes back from their lunch

829
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,200
break or their meeting they see an

830
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,040
envelope that is sealed with their name

831
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,000
on it in a secured location

832
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,240
and they see a usb drive who's not

833
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,560
plugging that in

834
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,760
can you name one of your employees

835
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,839
that's not plugging that one in

836
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,760
exactly very effective it's like who

837
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,040
wants to do drops you know doing the

838
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,960
whole scatter thing in the parking lot

839
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,800
that's so mr robot it's like i don't

840
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,720
want to do that it's like i want to make

841
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
it deliver to them

842
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,280
uh the clipboard also comes with you

843
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,079
know wi-fi pineapple screen crab

844
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,359
proxmart

845
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,720
and all the other things you know for

846
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,079
your hacking needs

847
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,599
including my emergency you know cell

848
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,359
phone because i just thought it was cool

849
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,000
uh i mean literally that's i don't ever

850
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,480
use it but it looks cool um

851
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,359
so the other role is the omg role that

852
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,480
is like i

853
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,800
robbed the place uh going in as a tv

854
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,720
producer uh a drunk guest uh i mean like

855
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,839
barefoot

856
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,160
t-shirt uh teenage mutant turtle pajama

857
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,240
bottoms i mean that is literally how

858
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,440
i've robbed places before successfully

859
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,640
uh so uh that's good and usually i'm

860
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,720
just using a pen or usb drive uh pen

861
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,640
uh usb drive pin or just a usb drive uh

862
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,400
rubber ducky or something like that

863
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,480
something basic something just like and

864
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,160
it's just outlandish like i need to use

865
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,599
the restroom it's like oh i'm just

866
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,400
coming in for a job interview or my car

867
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,960
broke down can i just come in here for

868
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,040
anything weird it's like because

869
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
sometimes i just don't have anything

870
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,280
else

871
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,040
and i'm just spitballing okay it's like

872
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,440
don't judge me i'm still successful

873
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,720
um

874
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,960
so the whole thing is the point is

875
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,680
remember if i do find a way in and

876
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,240
usually do because those are two places

877
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,480
where people told me i could not get in

878
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,839
and i did

879
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,240
that one seven stories up in the cosia

880
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,839
cypress where i had to climb on the

881
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,160
outside of a building on a vent going

882
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,680
the wrong way because they said that i

883
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,760
couldn't defeat their

884
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,440
security cameras

885
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
because uh and get into their server

886
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,520
room on the other side of the roof

887
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,200
i made the guy who said that take the

888
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,560
picture because the camera was in my

889
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,640
jacket and i had him holding my jacket

890
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,880
so that was fun

891
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,960
so remember if i get in make sure your

892
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,280
employees know how to respond once i'm

893
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,960
there this is a picture from um

894
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,839
this was the one from 2020. uh yeah this

895
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,280
is the picture of my best success story

896
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,880
ever

897
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,240
everybody talks about me accidentally

898
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,400
robbing a bank and and beirut like that

899
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,640
was cool that was a fail that was me

900
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,200
screwing up that was me not doing a good

901
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,599
job my best job was this one

902
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,680
because i went in there in 2019 and

903
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,119
destroyed them

904
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,800
i would i went through them like butter

905
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,760
in 2019 but i educated them i did

906
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,440
security awareness training with them i

907
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,280
got them to understand the importance of

908
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,440
what i was doing and why their users

909
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
needed to be educated

910
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,760
i go back in 2020

911
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,480
and i got stopped

912
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,320
from people that had not worked there

913
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,680
the year before

914
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,920
people who just were doing their job who

915
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,160
knew the proper process

916
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,400
their ceo during their employee yearly

917
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,359
meeting spent 10 minutes talking about

918
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,640
information security and the

919
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,320
responsibilities of their employees to

920
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,119
be involved in it

921
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,440
and they took it seriously

922
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,839
that's a win

923
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,960
red team is only in existence to make

924
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,000
the blue team better

925
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,839
and if you're not rooting for your

926
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,480
clients to succeed you're failing

927
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,560
that was one of the best engagements

928
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,000
i've ever had

929
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,079
because it showed that what i did the

930
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,200
year before mattered and it showed them

931
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,920
and it taught them and i did a good job

932
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,839
with that and telling them what that was

933
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,720
if i go in the next year and i break in

934
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,640
with the same exploit or the same

935
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,520
vulnerability that's not its success i

936
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,000
failed to properly show the users and

937
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,760
the clients

938
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,440
why they needed to take that seriously

939
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,760
i do get rant in the mornings

940
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,880
so solution one uh zero uh i don't know

941
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,160
if i have that much time do i have much

942
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,720
time but i have 20 more minutes don't i

943
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,480
i talk really fast he's like i don't

944
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
know it's like sorry

945
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,599
didn't mean to put you on the spot like

946
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,880
that it's like

947
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,079
this guy's like i don't like that

948
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,880
american it's like um

949
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,480
so yeah i i've been rushing because i

950
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
thought it was supposed to be a 10 but i

951
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,680
think i got till 10 20 right i'm looking

952
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,119
at you you know when you're coming on 10

953
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,800
20. i'm just

954
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,319
okay very good okay so i've got at least

955
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,240
20 minutes it's like so because i was

956
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,200
rushing through and i didn't want to

957
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,240
rush through because i want to talk

958
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,440
about these

959
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,800
so the first one is remembrance

960
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,440
perceptions we fail at security

961
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,240
awareness training because we talk about

962
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,920
hypotheticals no one wants to believe

963
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,400
something bad is going to happen

964
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,240
so when you talk about will be careful

965
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,480
of these situations they're thinking in

966
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,000
the back of their mind that's never

967
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,240
going to happen to us

968
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
oh that's not something that's going to

969
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,440
really happen to us

970
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,720
do you know one of the scariest places

971
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,319
that you could ever live

972
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,800
especially in america

973
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,920
a quiet neighborhood

974
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,880
because you read the newspapers

975
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,960
it's a quiet neighborhood nothing really

976
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,000
happened

977
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
no one knew about the hidden basement

978
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,599
it's like you know it's like that you

979
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,520
always hear it always happens in a quiet

980
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,599
neighborhood this is such a quiet

981
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,800
neighborhood

982
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,040
it's like i did who knew that he had

983
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,319
those many uzis you know

984
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,319
such a quiet neighborhood it's like i

985
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,760
didn't know about that collection of

986
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
human heads it's like

987
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,079
never living i want to live in a very

988
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,480
loud urban area

989
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,079
okay they seem way much safer

990
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,599
because it's about perception we don't

991
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,000
want to think that something happened

992
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,599
december 7th 1941 pearl harbor

993
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,680
one of the first radar and situations in

994
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,280
the world

995
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,880
most of the world was at war

996
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,359
they had a radar station and all of a

997
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,319
sudden

998
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,440
they got

999
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,079
a warning that planes were coming in

1000
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,839
from an unknown vector and unknown

1001
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,040
planes

1002
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,720
the guy fought

1003
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,280
did his job the radar was working

1004
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,599
perfect the technology did its job

1005
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,000
the person detecting it did their job

1006
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,160
and they reported it to their supervisor

1007
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,680
sir we got planes coming in from an

1008
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,480
unknown vector what should we do

1009
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,960
do you know what he did i kid you not

1010
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
in this time of like you're supposed to

1011
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,560
be at war you're supposed to be ready

1012
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,880
it's like things are going on

1013
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
he said those are probably our training

1014
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,200
planes coming in from california

1015
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,919
disregard

1016
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,480
that was it

1017
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,480
because if he would have thought the bad

1018
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,599
thing

1019
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,040
that means something bad was going to

1020
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,000
happen

1021
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,880
users and humans and people we don't

1022
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,800
want to think bad things can happen

1023
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,280
it's like and so we have to show them

1024
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,119
even though you don't want to think

1025
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,960
about those things you should be

1026
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,160
prepared for those things show them how

1027
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,960
these kind of attacks actually happen

1028
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,680
don't just do classes and scripts and

1029
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,599
like test this or 10

1030
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,400
10 uh question multiple choice every six

1031
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,680
months and think that you're qualified

1032
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,760
in security awareness training

1033
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,880
don't do a

1034
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,040
phishing uh campaign and think that

1035
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,240
you've done security awareness training

1036
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,720
it's like give them examples show them

1037
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,560
real world examples of places that have

1038
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
been compromised and what happened and

1039
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,000
how it happened

1040
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and let them know that it could happen

1041
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,319
at their place

1042
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,240
give them actual things that they can

1043
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,680
look at and see

1044
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,160
oh yeah that could have been me

1045
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,760
oh yeah i could that that could have

1046
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,880
been us

1047
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
we need to do better

1048
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,520
and make it part of the responsibility

1049
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,200
because you have and another what thing

1050
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,640
that you have to do is you need to

1051
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,839
interact how many times

1052
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,960
do you meet an employee when they didn't

1053
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,839
do something wrong

1054
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,040
are you actually going to your employees

1055
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,440
and talking to them

1056
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,119
when they didn't do something wrong

1057
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,960
i used to work in law enforcement and

1058
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,240
physical security you know 35 40 years

1059
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,119
ago i'm old uh it's like and when i did

1060
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,240
that

1061
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,560
i always met people on their worst

1062
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,440
possible day

1063
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,760
something horrible just happened

1064
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,599
and i showed up

1065
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,680
or i showed up

1066
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,359
something horrible is going to happen to

1067
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,040
them

1068
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,720
it was always the worst possible day

1069
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,440
with information security you need to

1070
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,520
stop that

1071
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,640
you need to be able to give out

1072
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,280
bulletins when there is a major flaw

1073
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,040
like an office thing you know it's like

1074
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,240
yeah that's a great thing to get

1075
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,680
everybody the buzz about like you know

1076
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,720
dropping old days in here that's great

1077
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,200
but it's also a good opportunity to send

1078
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,119
out a bulletin company wide saying by

1079
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,440
the way everyone there's there's a

1080
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,960
fallout we're looking at it we're

1081
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,240
researching it you don't have to give

1082
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
them the technical just let them know

1083
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,760
interact with them when uh ios updates

1084
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,319
come out android updates come out

1085
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,880
send out a notice to the employees to

1086
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,960
let them know by the way there's a new

1087
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,520
security update and it adds new emojis

1088
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,839
that'll get them trust me it's like it's

1089
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,079
like you show those and that shows that

1090
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,359
you're healthy if you do lunch and

1091
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,119
learns and help interact with the

1092
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,480
employees and let them know and also go

1093
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,560
and visit their employees and see what

1094
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,800
they're doing on a daily basis just

1095
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,560
saying hey i just want to shadow you a

1096
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
little bit to see what your job is like

1097
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,760
to make sure that

1098
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,400
we're in the sink and we're seeing the

1099
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,760
same kind of alerts and we know what

1100
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,520
kind of activity is going on here

1101
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,760
nothing bad no harm no foul literally

1102
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,359
just trying to get to know what's going

1103
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,839
on and getting to know the process

1104
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,040
then when something bad does happen

1105
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,640
they don't automatically see you as a

1106
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,720
threat when they see something

1107
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,880
suspicious they're comfortable with

1108
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,319
telling you

1109
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,640
because you got to do the three e's

1110
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,440
you got to educate them educate them not

1111
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,119
just security awareness i'm not talking

1112
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,760
about that you need to educate them that

1113
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,960
it's their job responsibility

1114
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,599
to be on the information security team

1115
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,960
that that's part of their job

1116
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,280
responsibility it's not just an

1117
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,720
afterthought

1118
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,760
it's like

1119
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,520
their job is to do hr to do uh pdf files

1120
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,920
to do filing to do all this and then

1121
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,680
also make sure their computers are

1122
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,520
secured

1123
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,200
it's like it's like you need to make

1124
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,240
sure that that is one of the

1125
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,400
responsibilities from the first day that

1126
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,640
they're hired

1127
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,359
then you got to empower them

1128
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,200
you got to make them feel confident and

1129
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,040
reward and understand and let them

1130
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,359
understand that you are actually there

1131
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,760
trying to help them not to catch them

1132
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,839
doing something wrong

1133
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,520
and you got to give them an extension to

1134
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,480
call and an email to forward suspicious

1135
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,680
emails to

1136
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,240
you've got to give them those tools so

1137
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,599
they can

1138
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,680
be part of the team

1139
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,880
and then you've got to enforce the

1140
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,079
policies

1141
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,000
one of the biggest hot take debates i've

1142
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,839
ever been on in twitter is this simple

1143
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,800
fact you do a fishing test someone fails

1144
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,680
it

1145
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,359
you re-educate them

1146
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,960
you take them through another class you

1147
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,240
educate them you explain to them what

1148
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,000
was wrong you tell them what they did

1149
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,160
wrong you tell them what happened and

1150
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
you make sure that they they do better

1151
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,480
the second time they fail it

1152
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,319
you put them on a segmented network with

1153
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,880
a white listed email uh server gateway

1154
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,400
that they have to like check out which

1155
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,000
emails they want to get out and it's

1156
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,880
heavily filtered and monitored

1157
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,800
they click on a third one you fire them

1158
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,240
i don't know how many people would let a

1159
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,359
delivery driver wreck a delivery van

1160
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,160
three times and stay employed

1161
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,640
that's a sixty thousand dollar van

1162
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,400
we're letting people click on emails

1163
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,559
that are costing companies 300 million

1164
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,839
and we're not blinking an eye

1165
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,760
it's like that's just the way it's got

1166
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,440
to be they got to understand if they

1167
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,040
don't understand that

1168
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,200
part of the way that they get to feed

1169
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,640
and clothe themselves and their

1170
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,200
dependents is based on doing good

1171
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,000
security policy mother they will do good

1172
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,400
security policy

1173
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,960
because that's tied into their pay

1174
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,119
but we're not letting them we're failing

1175
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,520
them and not telling them that's exactly

1176
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,079
what is happening

1177
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,520
so

1178
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,000
what we need to do better is we need to

1179
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,359
stop chasing oh days

1180
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,040
it's like people talking about like you

1181
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,240
know it's like all these current old

1182
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,119
days i'm like mother what about

1183
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,760
you you're we gotta catch the low ho the

1184
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,280
low hanging fruit

1185
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,119
you gotta be able to at least secure the

1186
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,880
low hanging fruit in your network and

1187
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,839
i'm like mother if the fruit's on the

1188
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:18,240
ground pick that stuff up

1189
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,160
and you know what the problem is that

1190
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,599
stuff sucks

1191
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,280
because you gotta have been down i got

1192
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,119
bad back and you got like you gotta do

1193
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,640
like you got oh i gotta do a base

1194
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,040
analysis on my network i gotta figure

1195
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,359
out what all my assets are i gotta

1196
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,680
figure out what our patch history is uh

1197
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,319
what's our patch policy uh how many

1198
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,240
servers have been patched

1199
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,959
that sucks

1200
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,960
stop complaining about your user stuff

1201
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,800
when you're not doing the hard work in

1202
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,359
the foundation

1203
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,960
foundations are vital and they're ugly

1204
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,880
whoever goes and looks at a wonderful

1205
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,280
skyscraper and go i wonder how well the

1206
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,000
foundation looks

1207
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,680
gross it's like you know concrete just

1208
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,440
slapped in it's like it's just all piled

1209
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,559
in there it's all

1210
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,559
that's not a good process it's not a fun

1211
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,040
process it's

1212
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,520
massively needed to make sure that the

1213
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,240
whole structure is stable

1214
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,160
so we need to start working on that more

1215
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:26,680
y'all think i'm joking i'm done this is

1216
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:34,400
[Applause]

1217
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,520
wow and i was told that um

1218
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,960
you know people are very shy like

1219
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,280
especially in the mornings and so i i

1220
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,440
always do it very well if there's no

1221
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,079
questions you don't have to worry okay i

1222
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,920
don't want anybody on the spot it's like

1223
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,599
i will run out into the audience and

1224
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,200
randomly pick someone to ask me a

1225
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,400
question

1226
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,480
so so don't worry i'm sure i'll get a

1227
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,559
question at some point

1228
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,480
questions yeah ah there's a brave person

1229
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,440
yes

1230
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,000

1232
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,800
nervous

1233
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,480
 i just got nervous before i

1234
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,160
spoke up here it's like anybody said

1235
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,680
they're not nervous like they're scary

1236
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,640
people it's like um my first uh he asked

1237
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,839
like do i ever get nervous on

1238
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,839
engagements my first thoughts on

1239
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,920
engagements are literally this process

1240
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,280
it's like

1241
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,319
no matter i've done this for years

1242
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,680
and every single one of them that's like

1243
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,920
i don't know how i do this it's like how

1244
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,520
this is going to go wrong as soon as it

1245
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,440
goes wrong they're not going to pay me

1246
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,640
they're not going to feel like i was

1247
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,359
worth the money i'm gonna be stupid it's

1248
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,599
like i'm gonna feel dumb it's like i

1249
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,040
don't know how i'm gonna get away with

1250
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,640
this it's like i don't really know if

1251
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,720
they're gonna let me in it's like i mean

1252
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,280
i feel desperate i feel like uh just 100

1253
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,520
like i have no idea what i'm doing and

1254
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,920
i've done things

1255
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,920
but to remember that i've done things

1256
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,800
before i got to do something is totally

1257
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,000
different

1258
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,599
and it's like so it's just it's

1259
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,040
ridiculous

1260
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,359
and so yes i get nervous all the time

1261
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,040
it's like it's like because you know

1262
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,359
that's just the way i am and and it's

1263
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,359
okay to be that way it's like we we

1264
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,040
always go around a situation where it's

1265
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,440
like especially on talks it's like and i

1266
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,440
did a talk one year about nothing but my

1267
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,000
fails because we get on these stages and

1268
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,520
you're in the audience and you see these

1269
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,680
people getting up here talking about the

1270
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,920
wonderful zero day they dropped or the

1271
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,720
technology they broke and you're like

1272
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,640
that's amazing how am i ever going to be

1273
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,520
that awesome and they never talk about

1274
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,599
all the times they failed trying to get

1275
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,119
to that point

1276
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,880
or all the different things that didn't

1277
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,559
go right

1278
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,960
it's like you know i have screwed up

1279
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,760
royally on engagements it's like i mean

1280
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,520
i've almost gotten arrested on a couple

1281
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,160
of engagements one time almost shot it's

1282
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,559
like it's like i've i've had i've done

1283
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,359
some things okay i took down a couple of

1284
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,319
servers here and then who hasn't come on

1285
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,319
it's like so yeah i've made that

1286
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:05,119
we need to make making mistakes normal

1287
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,040
again it's like it can't be about

1288
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,440
perfection it's got to be about learning

1289
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,920
and trying to do better

1290
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,839
next

1291
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:16,319
question don't be shy

1292
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,079
come on

1293
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,079
yep i was saying make me come down there

1294
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,200
yes

1295
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,960
uh two things yes and yes it's like yes

1296
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,800
that's no video but yes i still run

1297
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,520
across uh whether you got windows 7 it's

1298
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,800
like windows 8

1299
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,359
you would it it almost almost makes you

1300
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,319
weep uh about how uh bad systems are

1301
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,880
being upgraded uh but also the other key

1302
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,760
thing is what i'm doing is it didn't

1303
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,640
matter

1304
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,640
what operating system it was

1305
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,960
because i didn't have a payload on there

1306
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,839
i didn't do a vulnerability all it did

1307
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,800
was open up notepad on a windows 10

1308
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
machine or a windows 11 machine it will

1309
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,760
do the same thing because i am trying to

1310
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,559
teach them a lesson and show that this

1311
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,720
could have happened i am not trying to

1312
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,960
com and i've learned this in my red team

1313
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,559
and the reason why i don't do red

1314
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,160
teaming i don't do red teaming i'm not

1315
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,480
that cool i do security awareness

1316
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,960
engagements that's what i call them i

1317
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,839
make sure one i always get caught

1318
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,760
in my engagements because i got to give

1319
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,119
the company a win i got to give the

1320
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,040
users a win so it's not just all the

1321
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,480
things they did wrong they have

1322
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,160
something to look up to

1323
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,599
we need to be able to assure that we're

1324
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,599
just not beating them over the head with

1325
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,760
everything that made mistakes we got to

1326
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,599
show them that there is there's hope

1327
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,599
this is what this person did well

1328
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,040
it's like you know sometimes i've had to

1329
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,359
go out of my way to give them a win but

1330
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,520
it's like i make sure that happens

1331
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,240
the second of all is if you compromise

1332
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,760
and you show them a vulnerability like

1333
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,839
we got in here we've got all this data

1334
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,280
at the back of their mind they're

1335
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,240
thinking what else did they take

1336
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,839
what else do they have

1337
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,440
and now you own that network

1338
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,040
congratulations

1339
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,799
six months from now

1340
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,280
email server goes down didn't we have a

1341
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,119
security team coming in and fiddling

1342
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,920
around with our stuff on our network you

1343
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,359
own that

1344
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,920
it's like me i just show up

1345
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,160
i'm plugging the notepad dude it's like

1346
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,960
i just did a i mean and also literally

1347
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,559
that is the only thing that kept me out

1348
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,720
of lebanese prison it's like honestly

1349
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,400
was able to show the people that i

1350
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,559
accidentally robbed that it was just

1351
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,079
notepad uh it was it did not go well uh

1352
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,240
but uh i mean that is literally the only

1353
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,599
thing that kept me out of prison was the

1354
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,440
fact that it's like it was just a

1355
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,480
notepad exploit it wasn't trying to

1356
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,920
compromise or do a vulnerability

1357
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,400
anyone else

1358
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,799
i've got seven oh actually let's go like

1359
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,319
three minutes i've got one more question

1360
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,559
so that way it'll give this some time to

1361
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,480
actually get set up before his talk come

1362

yeah

1365
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,319
the most wacky thing i had to do to get

1366
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,480
caught oh my gosh i had destroyed this

1367
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,040
this company so badly and i felt really

1368
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,119
bad about it sometimes i don't

1369
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,200
i literally do everything i can because

1370
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
it's i'm trying to be there to teach i'm

1371
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,760
not trying to like show how cool i am or

1372
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,440
how bad i can break something i'm trying

1373
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,920
to give them a lessons and experience so

1374
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,559
when they catch me that's good

1375
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,079
that's an experience that's an

1376
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,559
educational lesson uh but this one

1377
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,079
wasn't they weren't getting it it's like

1378
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,760
i'd gone to three different branches i

1379
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,079
got in all three times tonight horribly

1380
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,640
bad uh i mean not horribly bad for me

1381
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,799
it's like horribly bad for them uh so

1382
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,280
this one i get in i got into the server

1383
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,280
room i got into the i'm behind the

1384
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,799
teller line

1385
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,040
for 20 minutes

1386
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,640
just wondering when the guy is going to

1387
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,680
realize

1388
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,839
who the am i you know just ask that

1389
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,520
question

1390
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,520
at least offer me some coffee or figure

1391
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,960
out who why is this guy standing here

1392
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,480
so i literally realized he's not going

1393
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,240
to get it so i

1394
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,760
scoot over to him i tap on his shoulder

1395
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,200
and because i'm sitting at this desk

1396
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,880
with this server this little desktop

1397
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,640
server thing doing some kind of business

1398
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,400
stuff and it's locked and i'm like

1399
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,200
excuse me uh what's the user id and

1400
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,079
password for this to this machine

1401
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,880
he tells me

1402
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,760
it's the user id and the password are

1403
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
the same it's the name of the machine

1404
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,520
that's in the prompt

1405
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,480
yay

1406
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,480
so i log in

1407
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,119
in the middle of business they're doing

1408
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,160
business

1409
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,480
i shut down this server

1410
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,480
that they're using

1411
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,079
i then unplug it from beneath the desk

1412
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,640
and i start walking out thinking

1413
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,440
maybe now they'll ask something

1414
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,160
and literally as soon as it was until

1415
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,799
not till i got to the gate of the teller

1416
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,520
line that the guy was like

1417
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,040
hold up

1418
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,799
can i help you

1419
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,720
no man i'm obviously helping myself i

1420
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,559
mean i literally i learned there was

1421
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,920
three or four different things i could

1422
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,319
have said that would have got him to

1423
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,920
to let me go but that wasn't the mission

1424
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,559
the mission was to educate as soon as he

1425
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,520
said can i help you i was like oh wow

1426
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,960
you got me

1427
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,119
crap yes this was a security assistant i

1428
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,720
was just checking to see if you were

1429
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,760
good i mean

1430
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,440
you you were just checking to make sure

1431
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,440
that i was like you know what if i was

1432
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,760
being sketchy or not like well done it's

1433
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,200
like you know you make sure i didn't go

1434
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,520
out the thing it's like i mean i mean

1435
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,680
you're just logging in just just scoping

1436
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,040
me out i understand it's like you did

1437
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,160
great

1438
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,200
you know and he was the hero

1439
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,440
and that's all that was necessary

1440
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,480
because

1441
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,480
it doesn't matter what really went on

1442
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,240
between me and him

1443
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,960
the report was i got caught

1444
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,960
and i had his name so the other

1445
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,799
employees got to see that he did a good

1446
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,760
job that it wasn't an impossible task

1447
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,599
that it wasn't something impossible that

1448
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,760
could not be done that all the other

1449
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,400
employees could be like that as well

1450
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,480
and so that was that was the worst i

1451
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,839
mean literally that was like

1452
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,319
you know it's like it was it was hard

1453
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:19,599
not to like

1454
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,240
just run at that point

1455
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,720
uh yes

1456
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,040
well that was a good uh good ques

1457
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,640
that's a good question last question but

1458
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,359
that was good um when i first started

1459
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:36,400
out

1460
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,240
i started out thinking that i had to be

1461
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,319
a red teamer just like and you see the

1462
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,000
problem is i have very low self-esteem

1463
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,319
and positive so i felt like when i was

1464
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,240
doing red team and because of the fact

1465
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,000
that i'm a high school dropout in no

1466
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,079
college and not as nearly as technical

1467
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,599
as some of these other people that are

1468
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,520
in this room that it's like i had to

1469
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,760
prove that i was so i was like i gotta

1470
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,520
destroy him i gotta do like really bad

1471
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,640
and stuff you know and i gotta like

1472
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,880
break into everything and then i just do

1473
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,799
a report and it was like and i never

1474
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,079
really liked it it's like because i

1475
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,520
didn't give them a report three months

1476
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,960
later they get a report saying this is

1477
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,160
what happened

1478
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,920
uh and so i was doing this one

1479
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,240
engagement uh for a federal building

1480
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,599
actually uh they loved this and um

1481
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,599
i was waiting to get into this one it's

1482
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,040
like there's a hallway and once again

1483
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,720
this is this is actually based on

1484
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,119
perception there was a hallway with a

1485
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,440
door this way and then an entrance way

1486
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,200
around the corner here in entrance way

1487
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,359
around the corner there so what i did

1488
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,839
was i stood behind one of the entrance

1489
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:32,960
ways

1490
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,359
and i went like this

1491
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,440
and i stood like this

1492
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,960
for about i think it was about five

1493
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,799
minutes and you got to learn to you

1494
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:43,359
stand like this so as soon as you hear

1495
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:44,960
that door open

1496
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,720
you're starting to walk

1497
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,200
and because your natural gate has

1498
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,119
already started

1499
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,880
subconsciously a person will perceive

1500
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,240
that you were already just coming from

1501
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,440
the other door

1502
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,920
versus if you start from a half the way

1503
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,240
you get you see how the the stance is

1504
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,599
different when you're starting off from

1505
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,000
us to versus when you've already started

1506
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,119
your gate

1507
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,040
and so i did that

1508
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,040
so someone came in

1509
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,960
and i this lady walked in she walked

1510
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,559
into the other door and i just followed

1511
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,000
him behind her

1512
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,359
and she looked at me like

1513
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,200
that's the sketchy eye in case anybody

1514
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,240
can't tell and so i'm like uh and so i

1515
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,160
just you know hi you know say hi it's

1516
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,880
like yeah and i turn left she goes right

1517
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,640
i go to the first office compromise the

1518
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,119
first machine i'm successful i won i

1519
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,559
beat them right

1520
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,319
and then i go to another machine oh and

1521
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,119
i've compromised another one yay me

1522
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,480
but then i come out of that second

1523
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,040
office and i see the lady

1524
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,160
down the hall talking to a another uh

1525
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,000
lady at a desk

1526
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,680
and there's concern and they're looking

1527
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,040
at me

1528
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,119
and i'm walking down this hallway toward

1529
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,359
them and the door to leave is on the

1530
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,640
right and i had this epiphany

1531
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,480
i could walk out that door to the right

1532
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,280
and be an awesome red teamer

1533
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,680
who's totally compromised this this

1534
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,559
floor

1535
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,240
that the client didn't really think i

1536
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,319
could get in

1537
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,359
or i could keep going forward

1538
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,280
and give them a lesson

1539
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,640
and let them win

1540
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,160
i went forward

1541
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,200
smiled hi to the lady it's like walked

1542
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,359
over to another thing and it's like and

1543
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:28,960
i was compromising another lady's

1544
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,760
machine when this six foot

1545
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,400
25 foot you know

1546
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,319
ex retired air force you know commando

1547
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,319
comes running in and i instantly

1548
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,640
regretted my decision okay

1549
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,400
and it's like he screams like what are

1550
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,280
you doing he's like you have

1551
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,520
authorization i'm like

1552
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,240
i didn't even give him my i had i always

1553
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,880
carry forged get out of jail free cards

1554
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,680
i

1555
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,520
i'm not going to lie i didn't even

1556
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,079
bother with that one i went call this

1557
01:02:58,079 --> 01:02:59,920
guy he will tell you what supposed to be

1558
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,119
here you know it's like and it gave them

1559
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,400
the win

1560
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,880
and so they learned from that

1561
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,760
and i never did a red team afterwards

1562
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,440
it's like it's always been security

1563
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,680
awareness engagements after that it's

1564
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,599

1565
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,760

speaker we have uh some notes that we

1586
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,559
actually sort of addressed before but we

1587
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,240
sort of missed them as well but yeah

1588
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,920

01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,238
making my mac try and say things

1643
01:08:58,238 --> 01:08:59,679
you're okay with

1644
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,040
uh

1645
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,198
it does not appear to be

1646
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,479
plugged in

1647
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,799
technology

1648
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,560
oh maybe i'm plugged into the wrong oh

1649
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,799
yeah

1650
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,960
there okay we're good now perfect cool

1651
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,640
right so let's uh

1652
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,359
let's drag this

1653
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,439
over here

1654
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,839
and then

1655
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,600
where's my cursor

1656
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,799
i need u

1657
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,439
and then you

1658
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:39,759
then i'm going to steal you oops

1659
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,318
right

1660
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,439
and then perfect good hi

1661
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:48,880
i'm dan

1662
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,920
uh

1663
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,319
on the internet i'm vis

1664
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,719
i'm going to be presenting today about

1665
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,560
uh some camera related silliness

1666
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,040
regarding basically watching the war in

1667
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,960
ukraine unfold live from my couch at

1668
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,440
home in san diego

1669
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,040
so it gets gets pretty colorful pretty

1670
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,320
fast

1671
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,800
so uh very quick who am i a lot of

1672
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,239
people like using this slide to talk

1673
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,320
about their vocational accolades and

1674
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,520
where they worked and cool stuff they

1675
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,040
did and i'm like no these are my hobbies

1676
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,679
i make hot sauce i fly quads i consulted

1677
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,280
for mr robot and

1678
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,360
and uh watch dogs too i used to do

1679
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,800
sysadmin and network stuff before i turn

1680
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,520
into a security guy um and largely i'm

1681
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,400
just kind of a loud mouth on the

1682
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,640
internet so it's it's a fun time

1683
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,880
and it makes for uh uh you know uh

1684
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,400
colorful weekends

1685
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,199
so a very quick uh like a brief sort of

1686
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,320
overview of the things i'm going to be

1687
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,800
covering today is essentially a brief

1688
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,560
history of how i keep getting sucked

1689
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,400
into the world of cameras uh not that

1690
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,320
i'm particularly aiming for that i just

1691
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,920
keep finding myself there somehow

1692
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,199
magically uh and uh sort of uh some

1693
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,120
techniques on how to discover cameras

1694
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,320
um

1695
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,480
uh discovering russian information uh

1696
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,800
tactics and techniques uh by finding

1697
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,040
cameras that were doing one thing

1698
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,560
today or yesterday and doing another

1699
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,880
thing today um failed attempts at doing

1700
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,159
camera consolidation because what

1701
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,600
happens when you find like 40 or 50

1702
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,040
cameras in another country that are

1703
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,560
interesting and how do you grapple with

1704
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,080
that what do you do with them

1705
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,199
um

1706
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,040
the sort of caveats for how to maintain

1707
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,199
that system and how to deal with it uh

1708
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,600
and then some cool other sort of remote

1709
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,520
sensing techniques that we discovered

1710
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,040
along the way that were cool and then

1711
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,800
some practical applications

1712
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,960
so um essentially covering this brief

1713
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,719
history with regards to the prevalence

1714
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,520
of webcams uh is a good good way to sort

1715
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,080
of warm folks up to to get into this uh

1716
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,760
methodology so i began it's all started

1717
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,080
for me in like 2012 i read a blog post

1718
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,719
on this website called console cowboys

1719
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,960
where um a guy owned a webcam and he

1720
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,400
decided to see what sort of shenanigans

1721
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,520
he could get up to with it so he

1722
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,520
basically downloaded the firmware and

1723
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,960
then used a tool called bin walk to

1724
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,520
unroll the firmware and he has a really

1725
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,600
colorful blog post that describes it and

1726
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,320
i

1727
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,640
read that and uh said well i'm not much

1728
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,159
of a dev but that seems pretty

1729
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,159
straightforward and you know bin walk

1730
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,120
has come a long way since but

1731
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,800
essentially you download a firmware from

1732
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,480
the internet and you run bin walk

1733
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,760
against it and it just gives you a

1734
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,760
directory full of stuff and sometimes

1735
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,040
that directory full of stuff has very

1736
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,719
colorful little diamonds in it um

1737
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,040
but yeah very colorful very interesting

1738
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,400
and i found a whole bunch of what is now

1739
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,880
called eye door or indirect object

1740
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,400
reference vulnerabilities where for

1741
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,239
example you have a camera and if you

1742
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,320
know what the url to the camera's video

1743
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,640
feed is and you go to that directly you

1744
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,560
don't get prompted for authentication so

1745
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,719
you may have default password or you may

1746
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,719
have no password or you may have changed

1747
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,159
the password but none of that matters

1748
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:33,600
because if you know what the url is to

1749
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,280
the picture you can just go to it

1750
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,920
directly so that's fun um

1751
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,800
and so i built a talk about that in 2013

1752
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,880
and took that to a conference and uh

1753
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,719
this command line here that's one line

1754
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:47,760
of bash which is ridiculous and and i'm

1755
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,280
i really love bash for this reason

1756
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,199
because this one

1757
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,159
um

1758
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,640
this one line of bash

1759
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,840
grabs

1760
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,480
everything from shodan up to a thousand

1761
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,600
findings that says uh if the product is

1762
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,239
oracle web logic on a certain port

1763
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,320
sorts it pipes it to nmap to check if

1764
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,320
the port is open if it's open then it

1765
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,960
uses awk and then x-args to basically

1766
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,400
create

1767
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,440
30

1768
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,920
threads of a bash command line which

1769
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,120
runs a curl command which checks the

1770
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,000
uh

1771
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,840
the end point that has been discovered

1772
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,440
to see if the vulnerability it's looking

1773
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,520
for exists and if it does exist it does

1774
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,760
some fun color coding and says yes you

1775
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,040
found the thing and then just dumps it

1776
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,120
to standard out so like in one line of

1777
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,679
bash you can scan the whole internet

1778
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,280
do an nmap

1779
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,800
like it's stupid i love it it's

1780
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,719
fantastic like this is everyone else is

1781
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,199
writing ml ai quantum computing and

1782
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,199
here's me with one line of bash

1783
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,760
um so it's like old school sysadmin mode

1784
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,880
like if you were assisted man like

1785
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,880
between 2000 and 2005 like those skills

1786
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,960
don't exist in the world much anymore so

1787
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,480
all this stuff is what lives under like

1788
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,480
your 250 000

1789
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,159
next generation firewall appliance

1790
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:58,080
that's what it's doing under the hood uh

1791
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,600
so that's pretty fun

1792
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,400
um but this is really neat uh

1793
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,760
this sort of technique is really neat in

1794
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,000
terms of like you can go from i found a

1795
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,760
thing to i can scan the whole internet

1796
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,920
for this thing with with one line of

1797
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,280
bash presuming you have the bandwidth to

1798
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,560
do it so

1799
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,679
um

1800
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,040
this gets colorful really quickly

1801
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,320
because generally speaking a lot of

1802
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,320
people that put cameras on the internet

1803
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,920
don't put them behind vpns they don't

1804
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,920
put them behind firewalls or they just

1805
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,920
they trust the vendor which tends to be

1806
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,760
sort of a dicey proposition from the get

1807
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,560
go

1808
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,640
so he fast forward seven years and i'm

1809
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,560
living in this townhouse in san diego

1810
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,960
and the neighbor next door to me is

1811
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,640
running a prostitution recruitment depot

1812
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,480
out of his apartment and the problem is

1813
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,560
that my front door is here and his front

1814
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,239
door is there and these people are

1815
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,920
showing up at like four in the morning

1816
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,239
and they might be high who knows they

1817
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,040
don't know which door is which so like

1818
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,480
i'm woken up at three in the morning

1819
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,840
because somebody's trying to walk into

1820
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,960
my house

1821
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,760
so like i had to learn very quickly um

1822
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,880
how to grapple with this scenario um so

1823
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,159
like this was this like these guys

1824
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,320
associates like this guy on the left

1825
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,520
um he stood out front of this dude's

1826
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,520
door for three hours pounding on the

1827
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,719
door and screaming and shouting because

1828
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,080
apparently there was something wrong but

1829
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,440
then the guy had gone um but uh that was

1830
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,280
fun to have to deal with uh and then

1831
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,600
this other guy on the right um i and

1832
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,800
this was after i had set up all my

1833
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,320
cameras because of some of this other

1834
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,400
shenanigans watched him carry weapons

1835
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,320
into and out of this guy's apartment and

1836
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,520
i'm like

1837
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,560
welp

1838
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,880
um so yeah like

1839
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,760
uh that was the sort of

1840
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,159
going back in time this

1841
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:32,960
like

1842
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,159
arc of events is a really good measure

1843
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:38,560
of why you spend the good money on the

1844
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,320
nice cameras that have high resolution

1845
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,080
and good frame rates and can see faces

1846
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,840
and can you know this is why you spend

1847
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,480
400 or 500 like a good access camera and

1848
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,960
not like 30 on the amcrest one because

1849
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,159
when you need to hear what they're

1850
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,920
saying or you need to see a face or you

1851
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,360
need to see what they're carrying like

1852
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,120
your your garbage grade sensor uh that's

1853
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,159
what'll get you so like there's one

1854
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,600
thing to say i want a cheap camera just

1855
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,880
to see if there's somebody there doing

1856
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,320
anything that's one thing and you know

1857
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,520
this camera will make me feel better and

1858
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,199
i won't i won't break the bank but if it

1859
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:08,640
has to go to the police

1860
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,719
the police can't help you if it's uh if

1861
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,960
what you're showing them is is like a

1862
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,280
like a like a monet painting it's just

1863
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,280
like a smear like oh yeah there's a guy

1864
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,640
and he's doing something or it could be

1865
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,159
a smudge on the lens um so yeah it's a

1866
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,080
it gets to be like well you have to

1867
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,960
start thinking about the stuff

1868
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,719
seriously when you reach that stage

1869
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,080
so at the time

1870
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,080
what i was doing was running multiple

1871
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,400
cameras and each camera was

1872
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,159
um

1873
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,719
capturing images and sending them to an

1874
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,159
email server that i was running in my

1875
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,679
house so

1876
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,600
i would look at my phone and emails

1877
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,880
would roll in and those emails would

1878
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,880
have like jpeg attachments and i thought

1879
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,640
that was kind of cool and with one or

1880
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,159
two cameras that's not that big of a

1881
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,000
deal unless you're in an airport or a

1882
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,960
foreign country where you don't have

1883
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,640
good data services because the minute

1884
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,760
you open your email client and you're

1885
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,040
like i want to see what's going on at my

1886
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,040
house and you you know you say check

1887
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,120
mail and then it takes four hours to

1888
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,920
download you know 200k of email messages

1889
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,960
because you're getting your internet

1890
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,800
through a drinking straw uh then that

1891
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,280
sort of it sort of bites you um or what

1892
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,120
happens if there's a tree like the cheap

1893
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,320
cameras can't tell the difference

1894
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,920
between a human being and like the

1895
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,600
shadow on the floor from a tree branch

1896
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,280
that's swaying in the wind and when that

1897
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,719
happens because it's like high winds in

1898
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,320
san diego one day suddenly you get like

1899
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,520
400 megs of email that floods your inbox

1900
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,560
of like

1901
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,159
a branch

1902
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,360
you're like wow this is great i spent

1903
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,080
all that time and money fantastic um

1904
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,400
but yeah so uh that was me getting

1905
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,440
getting bitten for taking the cheap

1906
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,800
route so i started investigating okay

1907
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,880
well how do i grapple with this like

1908
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,560
these are practical problems i'm trying

1909
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,640
to solve what do i what can i do next so

1910
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,159
i started looking around i got i got

1911
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,840
annoyed enough to start investigating

1912
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,400
and i found um these are two software

1913
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,159
packages that i discovered on the left

1914
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,360
there's one called blue iris which is

1915
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,480
like a software that you can put on a

1916
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,360
windows box uh and it's 60 or something

1917
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,280
like that and it has like your typical

1918
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,400
sort of dvr um functionality where you

1919
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,360
you aim it at rtsp urls for cameras and

1920
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,880
it'll do things like motion detection

1921
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,159
and all sorts of stuff but but they

1922
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,360
wanted money and i didn't want to spend

1923
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,280
a lot and that was my mistake and then

1924
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,239
on the right there's another one that i

1925
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,400
discovered called shinobi which looks a

1926
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,239
lot cooler and smoother it's got got

1927
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:17,760
html5 it's it's open source um and i

1928
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,600
discovered very recently that they made

1929
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,960
a docker instance of it which was cool

1930
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,719
at the time this was all close to 10

1931
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,640
years ago

1932
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,080
there that was like a software package

1933
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,520
you'd have to install in an ubuntu box

1934
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,600
and then it's basically it's a

1935
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,080
it's a really colorful uh fancy wrapper

1936
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,400
for a mountain of ffmpeg calls and

1937
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,159
ffmpeg if you've ever had to mess with

1938
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,480
ffmpeg is

1939
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,679
if you've ever dealt with a piece of

1940
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,199
software that will get angry at you and

1941
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,880
actually like use words to complain at

1942
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,560
you that you've done something wrong

1943
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,800
like that's ffmpeg ffmpeg will tell you

1944
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,239
that you should complain to the camera

1945
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,400
manufacturer because the packet stream

1946
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,320
coming out of the rtsb feed from the

1947
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,800
camera isn't to ffmpeg's liking like

1948
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,719
ffmpeg is the karen of software it's

1949
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:57,679
absurd

1950
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,679
like seriously

1951
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,080
but yeah so it's it's pretty wild

1952
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,360
um but yeah i looked at both of these

1953
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,120
and blue iris cost money and i didn't

1954
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,560
want to pay and shinobi was cool but um

1955
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,159
it doesn't have i haven't checked

1956
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,560
recently but it doesn't have good um ptz

1957
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,760
controls so if you have a camera that

1958
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,120
can you can drive around or zoom or

1959
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,159
whatever

1960
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,920
shinobi doesn't even have the you have

1961
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,400
to like manually map the buttons

1962
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,800
to like the button to move the camera to

1963
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,560
the right is this api call and you have

1964
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,320
to give it like a author authorization

1965
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,480
bearer token and like i'm like you know

1966
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,239
i just want to drive the camera around i

1967
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,080
wasn't planning on pro like really

1968
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,360
that's way too much overhead for just

1969
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,199
driving a camera around so i'm like oh

1970
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,520
that's silly um so i continued to

1971
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,679
investigate and um i discovered that

1972
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:41,440
qnap and synology which are both like

1973
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,080
nas appliance vendors they have like as

1974
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,560
a bonus add-on they have uh camera

1975
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,280
control software uh built into the nas

1976
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,640
so it's sort of double trouble which

1977
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,760
works out really well so you have like

1978
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,040
you have your nas and you aim your

1979
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,480
cameras at it or i guess the other way

1980
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,679
around you aim the software at the

1981
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,159
cameras and it imbibes all the video and

1982
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,000
it does all the heavy lifting on

1983
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,280
a piece of hardware so you're not having

1984
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,679
to individually manage you know 20

1985
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,600
different cameras settings of things

1986
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,679
well okay that's pretty handy um but the

1987
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,920
buy-in is you know 10 you know 10 20

1988
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,280
times more so instead of paying 60

1989
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,639
dollars for a piece of software you're

1990
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,000
paying several thousand dollars for a

1991
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,679
piece of hardware and oftentimes you're

1992
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:16,800
paying several thousand dollars for

1993
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,800
hardware before you even put disks in it

1994
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,320
so like this is like the big boy route

1995
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,679
this is like okay well i have a small

1996
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,199
office or a business or something and i

1997
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,480
i have a lot of cameras to deal with so

1998
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,560
on the left we have qnap solution and on

1999
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,080
the right we have synology and i ended

2000
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,760
up going with synology so like my

2001
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,480
current setup is synology with a obscene

2002
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,560
absurd like people will probably refer

2003
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,800
me to a psychologist number of cameras

2004
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,679
um

2005
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,760
yeah fun times um

2006
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,159
so beyond those everything else is kind

2007
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,320
of roll your own right so there's

2008
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,360
there's this like free open source

2009
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,320
uh

2010
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,159
scale and then there's like the grand

2011
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,400
canyon of nothing and then like i'm

2012
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,920
willing to spend five thousand dollars

2013
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,840
or more and there's not a lot in between

2014
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,679
and and everything like that in between

2015
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,360
section is if you're handy with

2016
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,960
writing code which i am

2017
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,719
if you saw me write python you'd slap me

2018
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,960
and you'd be right to um

2019
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,320
uh if you want to roll your own there's

2020
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,520
a lot of stuff you can do and in this

2021
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,199
case this is a screenshot of a command

2022
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,199
line tool called rtsp brute but that's

2023
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,719
not even video that's literally just a

2024
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,520
snapshot in time of like single images

2025
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,400
um you you aim this tool at a you know a

2026
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,400
litany of cameras and it'll grab

2027
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,320
imagery uh from them and put them in a

2028
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,080
little gallery and if you click the

2029
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,080
image then it'll give you the rtsp path

2030
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,520
and you can like paste that into vlc and

2031
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,199
you can watch one camera at a time which

2032
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,440
is cool for like proof of concept like i

2033
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,880
i found a bunch of cameras i want to

2034
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,239
eyeball them to see if there's anything

2035
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,480
interesting because that's how you sort

2036
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,199
of triage your findings to decide

2037
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:40,560
what do i actually care about like are

2038
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,840
the cameras doing anything interesting

2039
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,159
right um and that's largely what exists

2040
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,480
today in the sort of ecosystem

2041
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,719
um so like it's one thing you know to

2042
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,159
going back to my example where i have a

2043
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,520
practical application where i need three

2044
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,639
or four or five cameras because i have

2045
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,239
this crazy neighbor that i was blessed

2046
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,199
with

2047
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:58,880
um that uh yeah it was fun we this

2048
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,080
rum just

2049
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,800
rum is good um but uh

2050
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,239
what do you do when you have 40 or 50

2051
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,320
cameras right like it gets unwieldy

2052
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,600
pretty quickly and then to that end then

2053
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,960
you have all these other considerations

2054
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,639
i'll get into later like bandwidth and

2055
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,639
storage and cpu and ram and all that fun

2056
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,320
stuff um

2057
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,600
but yeah let's say you do this and you

2058
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,800
find a bunch of cameras that you like

2059
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,560
like how do you grapple with those

2060
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,400
findings so uh fast forward to like be

2061
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,040
like middle of february um

2062
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,320
uh the world is uh discovers that

2063
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,840
there's tanks driving across the border

2064
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,920
from russia into ukraine uh and suddenly

2065
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,560
everybody glues themselves to the news

2066
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,800
and now this is like as far as i know

2067
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,760
the first conflict of this nature to

2068
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,600
exist in a world where absolutely

2069
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,080
everyone has what in the 90s would be

2070
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,639
considered a supercomputer with like a

2071
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,960
full litany of sensors of

2072
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,080
uh cameras and mics and wi-fi and you

2073
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,560
can do all sorts of web this is like

2074
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,960
when i was a kid i played doom on a

2075
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,040
computer that had like

2076
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,920
four megabytes four megs of ram and now

2077
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,560
the pictures that i take on my phone how

2078
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,400
are consumed more space than some of the

2079
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,719
hard drives that used to exist back then

2080
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,000
so like

2081
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,280
um

2082
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,880
uh it's interesting to think that

2083
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,040
there's conflicts and everybody has a

2084
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,719
smartphone on them and

2085
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:17,920
uh

2086
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,000
that gives you this bizarre ability to

2087
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,120
do sensing of a variety of types so uh

2088
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,320
while things are happening we're all

2089
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,639
looking at the news and um i did what a

2090
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,040
lot of other people did which was uh i

2091
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,320
wonder if there are like touristy type

2092
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,920
webcams like so in san diego there's a

2093
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,520
vendor called um

2094
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,679
hd on tap and their whole business model

2095
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,800
is literally

2096
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,719
we will install a fancy high resolution

2097
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,320
camera with a nice microphone somewhere

2098
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,199
on your business and uh you can aim it

2099
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:46,400
at something that looks pretty or if

2100
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,760
you're you know at a zoo you can aim at

2101
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,280
the animals or if you're running like a

2102
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,520
uh like we have a san diego animal park

2103
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,800
is this world famous place where they do

2104
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,600
like

2105
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,040
conservation of animals and plants and

2106
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,960
stuff so they have like eagles and and

2107
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,080
vultures and things that they're trying

2108
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,760
to like bring the numbers up uh and

2109
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:00,880
they'll have like a fancy high

2110
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,960
resolution 4k camera of like

2111
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,639
birds nests and stuff so like animal

2112
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,000
people can watch that sort of thing well

2113
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,400
people can set up puppy cams whatever so

2114
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,639
certainly you know you would expect that

2115
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,320
places that are trying to attract

2116
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,560
tourists would use cameras as a

2117
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,800
mechanism to say look our place looks

2118
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,400
neat or cool or swell you should come

2119
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,159
and spend money at this place that you

2120
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,000
visually are attracted to

2121
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,080
and it totally works and the interesting

2122
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,600
thing was yes absolutely there were

2123
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,000
probably half a dozen of these

2124
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,080
tourist cameras that were put in like

2125
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,760
maiden square and freedom square and all

2126
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,880
these other places that were like

2127
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,719
commonly used as sort of tourist

2128
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,080
attractions where people now go and take

2129
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,000
selfies um

2130
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,600
and you could sit and what i was doing

2131
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,000
was basically three chrome windows with

2132
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,679
youtube um uh videos on my projector

2133
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,199
while i was sat in my living room on my

2134
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,960
laptop like sort of like war room style

2135
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,719
just like watching and one of the

2136
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,000
cameras was actually kind of cool it has

2137
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,760
a high resolution mic with one of those

2138
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,120
wind guards on it so you could get

2139
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,440
ambient sound from somewhere else in the

2140
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,360
world and i'm like that's pretty cool

2141
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,800
like i'm not looking at people

2142
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,639
necessarily but like being able to get

2143
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,800
sound from building on high

2144
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,239
it's like standing on a roof somewhere

2145
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,080
you can hear for literally miles around

2146
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,679
and you can tell stuff is happening and

2147
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,360
because you can see the horizon you have

2148
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,960
a view of the sky and the clouds you can

2149
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,320
see if sort of stuff blowing up in the

2150
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,520
distance like you're going to see lights

2151
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,120
and stuff so that's i'm like oh that's

2152
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,000
pretty cool i should probably

2153
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,159
investigate like what other cameras of

2154
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:22,960
this nature are around so it was sort of

2155
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,880
casually keeping the interesting ones

2156
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,800
open and then spending some time

2157
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,560
on the internet sort of perusing around

2158
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,840
trying to find um

2159
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,760
trying to find

2160
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:34,639
uh

2161
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:36,400
cameras of that nature which are like

2162
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,920
high resolution cameras on the top of

2163
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,440
roofs or on the top of apartment

2164
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,120
buildings looking at like the horizon

2165
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,400
essentially

2166
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,440
um

2167
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,280
so let's see if this works there's a

2168
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,600
video okay good does it work

2169
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,120
okay so hopefully if we have audio um

2170
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,199
where's my cursor there it is

2171
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,040
um this was particularly interesting so

2172
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,040
before i hit play uh because the audio

2173
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,800
is going to matter on the top left is

2174
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,159
one of those cameras i was talking about

2175
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,600
that's like high resolution camera a

2176
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,960
nice microphone things like that on the

2177
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,000
bottom left is the live feed of the bbc

2178
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,360
and the other two cameras were just

2179
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,840
other parts of ukraine uh that were just

2180
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,199
live cameras just to see stuff um

2181
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,199
the camera on the top left uh was

2182
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,719
particularly interesting to me because

2183
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,239
while i couldn't see much other than

2184
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,040
like the top of a church nearby um the

2185
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,040
audio was the interesting part because

2186
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,320
if you just sat there watching this

2187
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,920
thing you could hear a metal door open

2188
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,880
and close and then you could hear

2189
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,400
british people talking and i'm like

2190
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,000
that's kind of weird and if you listen

2191
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,520
to them talk enough

2192
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,440
you can tell that they were reporters so

2193
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,120
reporters were apparently going onto

2194
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,880
this roof and using that view as sort of

2195
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,120
their backdrop to do their segments

2196
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,080
and

2197
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,560
i discovered entirely by chance entirely

2198
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,880
happenstance that that camera

2199
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,440
was a tourist camera with a mic that the

2200
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,600
bbc didn't know was there or they didn't

2201
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,280
know was like hot miked and they were

2202
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,880
doing their segments

2203
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,320
uh where they were like their

2204
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,920
correspondent in the bulletproof vest

2205
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,600
was standing on the roof talking to the

2206
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,040
bbc live

2207
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,199
next to that camera so

2208
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:02,800
let's see if we can get audio here let's

2209
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,520
see if it works it's gonna work maybe

2210
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,040
we get lucky

2211
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,760
there's no audio

2212
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,280
oh

2213
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,880
well i guess

2214
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,159
can we get audio from the from the

2215
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,559
laptop

2216
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,480
maybe there's supposed to be stuff here

2217
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:23,440
it's

2218
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,520
yeah

2219
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,000
oh is it

2220
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:32,080
nope it's all the way up

2221
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,320
there we go okay so i'll restart it so

2222
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,840
this is really interesting pay attention

2223
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,840
to the uh when you can see hopefully you

2224
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,679
can see the mouse cursor when i click on

2225
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,440
the video on the top left you'll hear

2226
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,440
people talking and then um you'll click

2227
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,880
on the video or i'll click on the video

2228
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,320
on the bottom left and you'll hear them

2229
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,239
talking and there's about a five to ten

2230
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,239
second delay um so the whole thing is

2231
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:51,520
about two minutes long but this gets

2232
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,040
pretty wild so when i saw this i had i

2233
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,159
just whipped my phone out of my pocket

2234
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:55,440
because i couldn't figure out a faster

2235
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,440
way to record this because this was live

2236
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,760
and it's i wasn't set up to like push a

2237
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,120
big red button and record everything

2238
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,239
live so this is pretty great

2239
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,719
oops

2240
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,760
oh

2241
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,239
there we go

2242
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,480
okay

2243
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,960
well we suddenly understood that

2244
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,120
look you know tell us who's in control

2245
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,239
of this now is it the russians in

2246
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,080
control or is it ukrainians and they

2247
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,600
said it's the russians and i said where

2248
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,760
are the russians there

2249
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,679
you know if that's the case

2250
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:46,719
there

2251
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,719
were russian you know they

2252
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:50,239
you know there were no ukrainian troops

2253
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,159
around it i i said he said he said well

2254
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,000
i was like

2255
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,679
you know i am russian he was saying to

2256
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,920
me um and i looked at his arm back they

2257
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,320
have these orange and black uh bands

2258
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,400
white bands on their on their arms those

2259
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,960
are actually russians

2260
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,400
now all those troops you saw in that

2261
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,840
video there

2262
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,080
were russian you know they you know

2263
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,679
there were no ukrainian troops around

2264
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,040
now i i certainly said you said where

2265
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:13,800
else that i was like

2266
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,199
[Music]

2267
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,440
you know i am russia he was saying to me

2268
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,040
um and i looked through these armbands

2269
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,280
they had these orange and black armbands

2270
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,719
of ribbons

2271
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:25,120
and george

[Music]

2273
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,040
a public address that he's put out on

2274
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,159
social media an hour so ago uh you may

2275
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:43,600
have been talking about those sabotage

2276
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,719
groups you may be talking about those

2277
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:46,400
russian special forces because the

2278
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,719
concern now is because it's expressed by

2279
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:49,920
the u.s secretary of state it's been

2280
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,400
expressed by ukraine officials here

2281
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,280
is that the plan for russia may be to

2282
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,679
come in and not not just encircle

2283
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:58,880
but to come in and decapitate the

2284
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,199
leadership he's put out the social media

2285
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:03,600
and they also go uh you may have been

2286
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,199
talking about those sabotages they've

2287
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,480
been talking about those russian special

2288
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,440
forces because the concern now is being

2289
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,960
expressed by the secretary of state has

2290
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,600
been expressed by ukraine officials here

2291
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,480
is that the plan for russia may be to

2292
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,040
come in and not not just encircle pf to

2293
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,880
come in and decapitate the leadership

2294
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,800
and to replace the government here with

2295
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,880
a pro-moscow administration um solinsky

2296
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,400
yeah so

2297
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,239
it got really interesting

2298
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:31,920
really quickly

2299
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:32,880
like

2300
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,480
uh where are we going here

2301
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,440
oh yeah

2302
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,239
um

2303
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:42,800
so at that moment it was like okay

2304
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,000
uh

2305
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,040
now we're looking at uh

2306
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,800
well we suddenly understood oh that's

2307
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,080
weird

2308
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,719
there we go okay

2309
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:54,800
let me go to the next slide

2310
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,679
there okay yeah so fun time so in that

2311
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,679
moment suddenly uh things got really

2312
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,719
colorful really fast um so once that

2313
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:03,920
happened i'm like okay i got to find

2314
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:04,960
more of these cameras because now this

2315
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,480
is pretty wild because now i have like

2316
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,360
live

2317
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,760
live video from the ground in ukraine

2318
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,960
like in an active war zone uh and i'm

2319
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,400
accidentally getting behind the scenes

2320
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,880
audio from you know bbc newscasts that's

2321
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,280
pretty cool uh i'm not sure

2322
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,719
i guess they did notice eventually

2323
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,000
because about three or four days later

2324
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,920
that camera kind of disappeared

2325
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,120
i must not have been the only person

2326
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,159
that had discovered that because that

2327
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,679
was like just live on youtube like you

2328
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:29,120
go on youtube and you can like filter by

2329
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,639
live uh and that that was up so why that

2330
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:34,080
was there i'm guessing it was you know

2331
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,440
touristy something something but it

2332
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,679
turned into uh uh pretty interesting

2333
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,520
from like a reconnaissance open source

2334
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,560
intelligence

2335
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,639
perspective very fast so there was

2336
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:44,080
another organization called skyline

2337
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,840
webcams that that was i guess one of the

2338
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,960
sort of the parent organization that um

2339
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,480
kept track of

2340
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,719
all of the uh

2341
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,800
live high resolution webcams in ukraine

2342
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,040
and they had a ton of them and what i

2343
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,719
noticed when i started watching those

2344
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,800
was that they would slowly drop offline

2345
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,199
like two or three at a time and then

2346
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:05,360
rt and ruptly would stand up cameras

2347
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,080
with the same exact video feeds uh and

2348
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,040
you would think that you're looking at

2349
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,639
the same thing but you know if you look

2350
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,719
at twitter for example um

2351
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,000
there are there's accounts on twitter

2352
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,080
that are doing uh osn that are dedicated

2353
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:19,199
to the whole ukrainian invasion um or

2354
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,679
the invasion of ukraine rather and uh

2355
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,120
they are doing like minute-to-minute

2356
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,719
updates of oh this part of the country

2357
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,320
is being bombed there's skirmishes and

2358
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,000
fighting here or there's air raid sirens

2359
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,440
in this city or that city so i'd say

2360
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,400
like okay well we have a bunch of

2361
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,520
high-resolution

2362
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,040
video cameras with microphones in the

2363
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,719
city somewhere and twitter is saying

2364
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:35,679
that there's supposed to be airaid

2365
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:37,840
sirens going off but there's no airaid

2366
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,159
sirens on the audio in these cameras at

2367
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:40,880
all

2368
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,840
so uh you look at the old uh account and

2369
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,440
the old account is like skyline webcams

2370
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,719
and the new account is like rt and

2371
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,520
ruptly well our team replies russia so

2372
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,400
what russia was doing was going a week

2373
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,960
into the past and getting 24 hours of

2374
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,440
video in a loop and then using

2375
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,880
i uh if it were me i'd use something

2376
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,960
like obs to like take that stream and

2377
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,480
feed it back to youtube and call it a

2378
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,320
live stream so now you're showing you're

2379
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,440
doing like what hollywood does in the

2380
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,280
movies you're taking old video footage

2381
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,120
and playing it as live

2382
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,840
uh to obfuscate the fact that like the

2383
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,840
real live cameras have bad stuff

2384
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,320
happening on them but russia wants to

2385
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,440
not uh not take ownership of their own

2386
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,040
invasion so um they have these uh

2387
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,719
pieces of video footage that they're

2388
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,040
putting on a loop uh that i ended up

2389
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,239
looking at for a couple of days saying

2390
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:29,760
this is bizarre why like people on

2391
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,000
twitter are posting videos of stuff like

2392
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,600
like i guess there's telegram channels

2393
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,880
that folks there have been using to

2394
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,960
spread uh video clips of stuff happening

2395
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,880
so that people can see what's going on

2396
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,239
so there's like video clips of people

2397
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:41,679
that are you know a block away from the

2398
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:43,360
action posting stuff but the live

2399
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,639
cameras are like everything's happy and

2400
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,159
there's birds and ice cream trucks and

2401
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:47,760
i'm like uh

2402
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,920
no so i'm like okay well this is dumb

2403
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,000
how do i how do i continue monitoring

2404
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,760
stuff and not accidentally uh fall into

2405
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,719
disinformation um that's being published

2406
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:02,239
by invaders um so i started scanning the

2407
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:03,679
entire country myself because that's

2408
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:07,440
sort of my thing um so um

2409
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,440
i scanned the entirety of the ukrainian

2410
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,920
ip address space to find publicly uh

2411
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,040
open rtsp cameras uh and

2412
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,920
i

2413
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,199
the first scan was something like four

2414
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,679
million ips of those four million

2415
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,040
several hundred thousand were actually

2416
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,400
up and of the several hundred thousand

2417
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,679
that were up there about forty seven

2418
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,199
thousand that were actually rtsp

2419
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,600
endpoints that were

2420
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,040
acknowledging that yes hi i'm a camera

2421
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,800
on the internet and out of those forty

2422
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,960
seven 000 only about 2 000 or maybe 2

2423
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,639
500 or actually cameras that were live

2424
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:36,400
that we could like look at that weren't

2425
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,840
password protected that we could uh uh

2426
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,199
you know

2427
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,280
peruse through so i went back to the

2428
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,600
glory days of uh sweeping the internet

2429
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,600
for cameras to see like does the old

2430
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,960
technique still work and yes it

2431
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,880
absolutely totally does and there's been

2432
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,159
a lot of interesting colorful new

2433
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:54,719
developments since um so i used a tool

2434
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,440
called rtsp root to basically uh well i

2435
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,360
use a combination of like several steps

2436
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,080
right to find you do a sweep for example

2437
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,920
i did you know grabbing ips from

2438
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,400
showdown validating those ips were up

2439
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,639
and then taking the resulting like known

2440
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,159
good list of cameras and handing that to

2441
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:12,880
rtsp boot which then produces this

2442
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,360
little uh mosaic

2443
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,199
uh and that was the that was the sort of

2444
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:18,960
end result but like i'll take you

2445
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,080
through uh

2446
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,600
uh

2447
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,600
some of the colorful uh horrible fails

2448
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,920
that happened before this um so the

2449
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,280
objective here with this again was not

2450
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,880
like i had no interest in looking at

2451
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,679
like people's homes or inside businesses

2452
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,400
and there was tons of those like

2453
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,000
cameras monitoring people's driveways

2454
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,560
and backyards and like coffee shops and

2455
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,480
restaurants and retail stores and

2456
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:41,600
those might be interesting for some

2457
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,400
other

2458
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,880
use case but in my in my uh

2459
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,639
efforts here i was specifically looking

2460
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,239
for stuff largely like cameras on

2461
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:50,239
rooftops cameras on tall apartment

2462
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:51,520
buildings because i wanted a view of the

2463
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,719
horizon because that's how you see

2464
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:54,080
interesting stuff

2465
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,040
um

2466
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,760
so this if you've ever messed with vlc

2467
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,520
vlc has this

2468
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,639
i think this is another one of these

2469
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,159
like open source authors writing stuff

2470
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:04,960
to punish their users kind of deals the

2471
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,520
vlc has a thing called an rtsp mosaic

2472
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,400
that you can do and the rtsp mosaic

2473
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,159
is um

2474
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:13,840
you create essentially an xml file and

2475
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,199
you give it all the parameters of the

2476
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,440
videos in the xml file and it will take

2477
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,600
like a single screen of vlc and it will

2478
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,239
tile the videos across that screen

2479
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:24,320
and it works great for about 10 seconds

2480
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,080
until one camera drops offline for a bit

2481
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,679
and then it turns into microsoft word

2482
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:29,119
where everything gets jumbled up and you

2483
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:30,719
can't get your original format back and

2484
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:31,760
everything you just want to burn the

2485
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,760
world and kick a chair around the room

2486
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,520
so i burned about three days on that and

2487
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,760
that's why i have gray hair now um and

2488
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,280
then i abandoned that pretty quickly and

2489
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,960
tried to do uh something else so yeah

2490
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,880
zero out of ten would not research again

2491
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,040
uh vlc is fun for watching movies but

2492
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,520
don't art the rtsp mosaic thing is it's

2493
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,960
ancient and apparently nobody's touched

2494
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,159
it or updated it in like 15 years so

2495
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,280
but yeah so

2496
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,719
it got interesting pretty quickly when i

2497
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,639
started discovering cameras that was

2498
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:58,639
like this one here on the left is a

2499
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:00,080
ukrainian soldier walking up to a

2500
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,440
doorbell because apparently there's like

2501
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,360
doorbell cameras that are just on the

2502
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,520
internet facing outward into the street

2503
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,719
that camera actually turned out pretty

2504
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:09,360
cool the initial um image from my first

2505
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:12,000
slide with that apc sit side against the

2506
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,760
fog that came from that camera which

2507
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,119
incidentally the camera's not online

2508
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:16,800
anymore but it was about a block from

2509
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,760
zalensky's hq which that was three days

2510
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,719
of doing os and driving around um

2511
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:24,320
driving around google maps to try and

2512
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,159
figure out uh

2513
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:27,520
where the camera actually was because

2514
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,800
there's a whole other component to this

2515
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,159
after the fact of like now you have a

2516
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:30,880
whole bunch of cameras that are

2517
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,480
interesting where are they where are

2518
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,239
they pointing what can they see can you

2519
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:36,080
put them on a map and then there's all

2520
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,920
sorts of colorful stuff you can do after

2521
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,840
that but like the cameras are

2522
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,119
interesting

2523
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:42,800
of themselves if you look at them but it

2524
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,320
gets way more interesting if you can

2525
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,639
geolocate them

2526
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,199
but yeah so in this case uh like so the

2527
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,119
vlc component was like uh it was

2528
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,639
snapshot on time you could only see what

2529
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,000
was happening live there was no real

2530
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,760
right way to record you couldn't do

2531
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,600
motion detection anything like that so i

2532
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,119
abandoned the whole vlc thing and ended

2533
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:02,000
up um trying to go back to uh shinobi

2534
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
and it turns out that you don't have to

2535
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,920
drive cameras around with ptz shinobi is

2536
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,159
actually pretty cool and now because

2537
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,639
docker we live in the future um shinobi

2538
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:12,080
is available as a docker container so

2539
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,199
you don't have to do a bunch of clue g

2540
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:14,159
messy

2541
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:17,360
setup by hand you just drop docker in

2542
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,119
light up shinobi and then you just start

2543
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:21,360
feeding it cameras and you have that

2544
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,639
but then you have all the extra added

2545
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,639
features of like motion detection and

2546
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,000
being able to like um

2547
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,679
store video on disk and rollback time

2548
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:31,760
and things like that but like any other

2549
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,360
open source project it comes with

2550
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,920
caveats and the problem with uh with

2551
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,360
shinobi is that it is like i said

2552
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,760
earlier a uh very colorful interesting

2553
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,840
wrapper for ffmpeg and ffmpeg is a very

2554
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,480
angry piece of software ffmpeg will

2555
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,320
create dozens and dozens or hundreds and

2556
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,639
hundreds of zombie processes because if

2557
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:50,000
you're trying to talk to cameras across

2558
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,639
like multiple oceanic links the the tcp

2559
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:54,239
stream isn't always stable and if it

2560
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:57,600
crashes or the tcp if the data lands in

2561
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,560
ffmpeg that it doesn't like it creates a

2562
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,239
zombie process and what happens when you

2563
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:04,320
have like 7 000 zombie processes on your

2564
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,440
machine well

2565
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,600
your machine has a bad day

2566
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,760
so

2567
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,520
in this case i actually had to write a

2568
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,639
wrapper script to

2569
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:17,199
handle this whole process of the camera

2570
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,119
solution that i was running was creating

2571
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,800
zombie processes and denial of servicing

2572
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,320
the machine that i put it on so

2573
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,159
i now have this colorful wrapper script

2574
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:27,360
which basically like counts the number

2575
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,880
of zombie processes and when it reaches

2576
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,400
a certain number it like bounces the

2577
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,880
docker container which then has

2578
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,040
follow-on issues because

2579
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,119
the shinobi is recording 15-minute

2580
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:38,719
segments and if something interesting

2581
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:40,560
happens inside that 15-minute segment

2582
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,040
and you call a restart during that

2583
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,480
15-minute recording you lose that

2584
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,040
segment so i'm like wow fantastic now we

2585
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,239
have like fun tech other people's

2586
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,440
technical debt that i get to go deal

2587
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,080
with um but yeah the other thing is that

2588
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,480
browsers um

2589
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,520
browsers can't do rtsp like at all like

2590
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,159
they'll like browsers will do uh mp4s

2591
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:03,520
and they'll do uh flv flv ancient and

2592
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,280
several other video formats but from

2593
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,360
like dealing with video perspective

2594
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,040
browsers don't do rtsp you have to like

2595
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,639
wrap it in something or transcode it on

2596
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:12,159
the fly so

2597
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,800
that's what shinobi does it it imbibes

2598
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,400
rtsp streams from the cameras and then

2599
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:20,000
translates that to um hls i think is the

2600
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,159
format that it's using at the minute so

2601
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:23,440
that your browser can actually see it

2602
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,199
and that transcoding process happens

2603
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:27,440
using ffmpeg

2604
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,280
and so anytime there's a hiccup or it

2605
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,800
chokes at all you get zombie process so

2606
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,480
that's fun

2607
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,080
but yeah here's that here's that

2608
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,920
doorbell camera again so that's a pretty

2609
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,520
wild thing to be able to just see and

2610
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,520
watch as shift changes when you see like

2611
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,440
troop movements and things like that um

2612
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,560
nothing particularly interesting

2613
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,320
happened on the camera like thankfully i

2614
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,239
didn't like there's no craziness i

2615
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:49,520
didn't have to see ugly war things um

2616
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,119
but uh

2617
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:53,600
it's it's just wild to be able to aim

2618
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,199
computers at another country and see

2619
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:56,639
this stuff just because it's on the

2620
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,560
internet completely public

2621
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,760
uh this thing stayed up for about two

2622
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,119
months before it went offline i imagine

2623
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:02,400
that i wasn't actually i know that i

2624
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,520
wasn't the first person to to um go look

2625
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,600
but some of the other things that i had

2626
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,440
discovered before they went offline were

2627
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,600
like this entire bottom row here these

2628
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,239
are uh dash cams that are connected to

2629
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,239
the internet with zero authentication

2630
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,320
exposing a front facing and a

2631
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:21,440
rear-facing camera that uh

2632
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,960
these things are connected and powered

2633
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,480
by the car's battery so if you pop these

2634
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,000
things open in vlc you can watch these

2635
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,760
guys driving around you can like listen

2636
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,920
to them talk because the camera system

2637
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,440
is inside the car

2638
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,360
mounted to the dashboard or

2639
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,040
suction cup to the window or the uh

2640
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,000
windshield

2641
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,119
and uh

2642
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:40,880
i guess these were like a private

2643
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,880
security company that had like the

2644
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,320
volunteers that were working or the

2645
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,280
people that were working for the private

2646
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,639
security company had volunteered to be

2647
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:47,760
like part of the

2648
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,159
the defense forces like the volunteers

2649
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:51,679
so now they're all in body armor with

2650
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:54,560
ak-47s driving around trying to you know

2651
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,840
uh

2652
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,040
see something say something or see

2653
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,719
something shoot something

2654
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:00,320
and those are all up for a little while

2655
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,880
now they all went offline um the top

2656
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,679
left is a camera that i think

2657
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:07,760
uh was three or four police stations in

2658
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:08,880
disney pro

2659
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,400
because the format was all the same the

2660
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,920
name is in the bottom right and the time

2661
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,920
stamp is in the top left and everybody

2662
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,840
was wearing the same uniforms and we get

2663
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,159
to watch them set up sandbags and again

2664
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:19,280
nothing particularly interesting

2665
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,480
happened but it was just fun to be able

2666
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,800
to see this live like it's not every day

2667
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,080
you pop open a webcam on the internet

2668
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,360
and there's like dudes with assault

2669
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,760
rifles hanging out on camera and on the

2670
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,679
top right that's um if you look at a map

2671
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:31,760
of kiev um in the bottom right hand part

2672
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,360
of the city there's a train station and

2673
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,800
then i guess this was a construction

2674
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,480
site that had turned their camera around

2675
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:40,000
towards the uh the city and the light is

2676
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,239
like some kind of shelling was happening

2677
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,159
and the video processing that i'd been

2678
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:45,360
doing at the time captured this on

2679
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,480
videos i couldn't tell it was happening

2680
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:47,920
because the the

2681
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,320
video was fairly low resolution but

2682
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,840
stuff was exploding and it was causing

2683
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,600
light to be thrown into the sky so it

2684
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,400
was like you could watch this live on

2685
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,480
this camera and then look at twitter and

2686
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,239
in 15 minutes you would start seeing

2687
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:02,000
people screaming about how there's um

2688
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,840
shelling happening and take cover and

2689
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,960
air raid sirens and that sort of stuff

2690
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,400
so it was bizarre to be like ahead of

2691
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:11,040
the curve um in that sort of scenario um

2692
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,639
but uh this was uh if you remember the

2693
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:14,719
the big thing where the the um tv

2694
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:16,400
antenna took artillery and that made the

2695
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,800
news and it was a big deal uh i caught

2696
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,639
that and this is the video from my

2697
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:23,199
system that live caught the uh

2698
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:24,719
shelling happening this was a camera on

2699
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:26,159
an apartment building

2700
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:28,400
a couple of miles away uh and this was

2701
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:29,760
like really zoomed in because you can

2702
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,080
probably see the pixels or this big um

2703
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,520
but uh

2704
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,440
this is one of these like it happened so

2705
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,440
i'm in in san diego in pacific time so

2706
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,719
this happened while i was asleep but

2707
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,400
because the system had been recording

2708
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,920
the video and based on the number of

2709
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,040
cameras and the uh resolution that i was

2710
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,480
storing stuff out i was able to go back

2711
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,800
in time about six days

2712
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,639
uh so if anything interesting happened

2713
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,000
that made the news i could roll back

2714
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,600
time and go and see if i can like match

2715
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,040
the time stamp of the camera to where

2716
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,280
the news article was and and figure out

2717
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,880
like what happened so in this case you

2718
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,320
could see like yep they're they're

2719
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,480
trying to bomb the the tv antenna um

2720
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,159
this camera is also sadly offline but

2721
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:05,600
this is one of the more interesting ones

2722
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:06,960
um

2723
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,400
uh this was also pretty colorful and

2724
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,440
interesting this camera's actually still

2725
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,159
alive um this is a camera in a city

2726
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:12,960
that's

2727
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,119
east of kiev aimed at keeve the

2728
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:16,639
resolution is pretty low but you can see

2729
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:20,159
like in that top left frame um there's

2730
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,320
some kind of rockets being launched

2731
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,639
and then they impact stuff in the sky

2732
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:26,000
you can't really tell what's going on

2733
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,280
kind of sort of but then like you see

2734
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,360
this and then five minutes later ten

2735
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,119
minutes later on twitter you see people

2736
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:33,040
um talking about how ukraine just shot

2737
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,040
down um a russian mig

2738
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,639
uh wow that's pretty interesting and

2739
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:37,760
then here in the bottom right you can

2740
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:38,880
see like

2741
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,159
some kind of fire or the bottom left

2742
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:41,199
rather you can see some kind of fire

2743
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:42,560
happening and then on the right you can

2744
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,360
see

2745
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,280
kind of looks like fireworks at the time

2746
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,639
i had no idea what that was what was

2747
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,320
happening and then like three weeks

2748
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,000
later i started seeing video like this

2749
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,679
landing on twitter from from people on

2750
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:53,280
the internet sharing video up close and

2751
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:54,880
that's russia shooting uh white

2752
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,880
phosphorus and it looks like fireworks

2753
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:59,280
but that it's really bad for you when it

2754
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,560
lands

2755
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,480
designed to kill people um but from a

2756
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,760
distance it looks like fire at the time

2757
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:04,880
i had no idea what it was but i'm

2758
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,560
guessing like the

2759
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,239
i'm thinking that it's hard to tell

2760
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:10,159
right like ukrainians are firing on the

2761
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:11,760
left and then like that's the impact

2762
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,440
zone for like russia firing on the right

2763
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,480
because if you look at a map of where

2764
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:17,440
this was this camera is facing west and

2765
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:20,560
at the time russia was north of kiev and

2766
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,719
kiev is kind of like center frame there

2767
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:24,320
so off to the right would be north of

2768
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,760
kiev so it's like okay well it makes

2769
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,040
sense from a geographical perspective

2770
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,960
but this is sort of what i was after was

2771
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,159
i wasn't interested in finding like

2772
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,080
gruesome like on the street stuff but

2773
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,719
largely just what parts uh what cities

2774
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:36,080
or parts of ukraine are under

2775
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,960
bombardment what's actually happening um

2776
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,560
like at a high level what's going on so

2777
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,760
these cameras that are aimed at the sky

2778
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,800
tend to be really colorful and

2779
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,480
interesting

2780
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,560
and then uh we started seeing this

2781
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,920
obviously like i said i don't think i

2782
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,920
was the first person there um because

2783
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,760
you know teenagers need need their

2784
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,159
hacker time too i guess uh this camera

2785
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:55,440
here in the bottom left that says stay

2786
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,280
safe off the top left so i guess some

2787
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,719
like good samaritan just went and put a

2788
01:45:58,719 --> 01:45:59,920
note in or whatever

2789
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,719
um and then um on the right there's

2790
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,800
um a camera that's

2791
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,960
uh glorifying russia so like i guess

2792
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,560
this is uh somebody in support of russia

2793
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,080
found the default credentials to this

2794
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,639
camera and they're hacking was def just

2795
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:14,400
putting text just defacing the camera

2796
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,400
and in the top right which is a bit a

2797
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,639
bit somber which is a person in their

2798
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,560
house who has put tape over their

2799
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,080
windows with the expectation that if

2800
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,840
artillery lands near them glass is going

2801
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,360
to come shooting into their house and

2802
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,560
they're uh they've brought their

2803
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,080
mattress into like i guess right in

2804
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,840
front of their front door uh and dealing

2805
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,840
with that so that's kind of depressing

2806
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,760
um but uh

2807
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,760
i think out of

2808
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,440
several thousand cameras i had been

2809
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,400
through with the exception of like

2810
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,480
people outside with rifles there's just

2811
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,080
nobody it's bizarre it's like 28 days

2812
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,360
later like some of these cameras just

2813
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,639
have literally nothing on them like

2814
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,800
empty streets empty businesses empty

2815
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,280
gyms i found a like a sea world type

2816
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:51,119
place that had like dolphins and stuff

2817
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:52,719
empty everything there's just no people

2818
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:54,159
it's bizarre with the exception again of

2819
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:56,080
like you get uh these security cameras

2820
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:58,000
uh what i believe were police stations

2821
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,080
with like dudes with guns out front um

2822
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,360
but occasionally you get a little a

2823
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:02,800
little ray of sunshine a little bit of

2824
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,960
comedy relief uh one of the cameras that

2825
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,119
i had discovered was a rtsp stream of

2826
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:09,920
the ukrainian like american comedy

2827
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,920
cartoons and comedy shows trans like

2828
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,199
dubbed in ukrainian being uh just

2829
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:17,360
available like

2830
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,199
this must have been somebody's personal

2831
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:21,280
system or something but like if you can

2832
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,800
understand ukrainian you can sit and

2833
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,159
watch cartoons

2834
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:24,960
um

2835
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,960
from some camera from some rtsp endpoint

2836
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,159
in ukraine well that's that's kind of

2837
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:31,119
amusing so yeah they've they had the

2838
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:32,480
bob's burgers and rick and morty and a

2839
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,760
bunch of stand-up comedian stuff it's

2840
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,400
like they're like comedy channel um

2841
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:37,760
but then you have like the same thing

2842
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,800
you got uh cameras uh for every like one

2843
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,080
pro russian

2844
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,960
uh camera they were like 15 or 20 pro

2845
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,960
ukrainian ones so this one's like this

2846
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,040
is davai ukrainian which is like let's

2847
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,440
go ukraine um but yeah there's been a

2848
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,440
handful of these so it's largely that's

2849
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,719
all i've seen from like the defacement

2850
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:55,760
thing so there's

2851
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,360
this whole business with cameras is very

2852
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,760
uh binary either they work or they don't

2853
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:00,719
and there's not a whole lot of in

2854
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:02,400
between so like

2855
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,639
if a place is getting shelled um

2856
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:06,719
generally one of the first things to go

2857
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:10,239
is like the power and the internet so if

2858
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:11,520
you have a bunch of really cool cameras

2859
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,440
and one part of when i say really cool i

2860
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,880
just mean they're aimed at interesting

2861
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,840
things that are uh

2862
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,719
informative um

2863
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:20,239
but you have a a bunch of interesting

2864
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:21,520
cameras in a place and that place starts

2865
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,119
taking artillery fire

2866
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:25,119
well the power goes away and if the

2867
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:26,800
power goes away then the camera goes

2868
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,480
away or if the power goes away the

2869
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,960
internet infrastructure goes away uh so

2870
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,320
you just lose whole swaths of cameras um

2871
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,239
so for the first you know

2872
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,639
four weeks i had 40 50 cameras in the

2873
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,480
system and uh and i'll get into the

2874
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,840
technical considerations of how to

2875
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,119
grapple with all that stuff because you

2876
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:44,639
need a pretty buff machine to deal with

2877
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:46,480
all that transcoding and all the storage

2878
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:49,119
too um but now i have like

2879
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:52,000
four maybe uh and that that last camera

2880
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,280
that one of the interesting stuff on it

2881
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,960
um is one of those remaining four but

2882
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,400
yeah like when when a place starts

2883
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,679
taking fire

2884
01:48:57,679 --> 01:48:59,440
well all the cameras in that frame if

2885
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,040
there were any cameras in that frame are

2886
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,239
probably toast

2887
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:04,000
so it's an interesting sort of um

2888
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,760
indicator where if you have a bunch of

2889
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,920
cameras in one part of a city or a

2890
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,600
country and all of them go offline at

2891
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,760
once well that might be

2892
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,560
an indicator that they're taking fire um

2893
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,880
and so like uh in this about what was it

2894
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:17,840
um

2895
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,599
towards the end of march uh all these

2896
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:21,199
cameras started to fall off and it was

2897
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:22,480
sort of a combination of like physical

2898
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,159
bombardment and then like the operators

2899
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:25,440
of the cameras discovering that the

2900
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,960
camera was public and then taking them

2901
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,719
offline or adding a password where there

2902
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,800
formerly was no password uh or moving

2903
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,080
the camera to make it no longer

2904
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,920
interesting uh so then life got in the

2905
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,360
way for me and i had to put this project

2906
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,719
down for several weeks and when i came

2907
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:38,480
back to it like i used to have 40

2908
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,239
cameras and now like five or six were

2909
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:42,400
working um but by then

2910
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,480
uh so many people were posting videos to

2911
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,159
twitter and to

2912
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:49,119
other uh uh social media platforms where

2913
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:51,679
like um

2914
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:52,880
these are gonna be the more interesting

2915
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,560
ones because these are folks that are

2916
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,159
there and they'll have video and it's a

2917
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:57,920
lot higher resolution so the stuff that

2918
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,719
i was after is largely um sort of an

2919
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,159
indicator of stuff is happening in that

2920
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:04,159
region and it's a lot less it's more

2921
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:05,920
zoomed out i guess if you could say uh

2922
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,840
and then beyond that um some really

2923
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,440
ingenious folks and this is glorious

2924
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,040
this is we live in the future this is

2925
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,920
fantastic so this is a web sdr like

2926
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,760
somebody has some high-powered sdr

2927
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:17,679
attached to this is the university

2928
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:19,520
university of netherlands

2929
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,599
um they have an sdr attached to a

2930
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:24,239
website that's like super 90s geocities

2931
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:25,599
mode

2932
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:27,840
where you can tune the sdr

2933
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,480
and listen to stuff and it's like

2934
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,440
um

2935
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,119
gqrs or

2936
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:33,920
or

2937
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:36,800
sdr sharp with less features but on a

2938
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,040
website so you can be any anywhere in

2939
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,320
the world and you can browse to this

2940
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,719
website and you can look at the sdr and

2941
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:44,400
if you find you know in the waterfall oh

2942
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,159
hey there's stuff there and you click

2943
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:47,040
there

2944
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,280
you'll hear audio and what you can see

2945
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,440
in some of these notes is like

2946
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:54,960
russian the pip russian rdl russian navy

2947
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:59,360
uh russian squeaky wheel um

2948
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:02,400
the russian invaders were using

2949
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,840
baofeng cheap 50 dollar

2950
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,320
hobby radios to invade a country they

2951
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,320
weren't using military equipment and so

2952
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,960
because they're using completely analog

2953
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,800
completely unencrypted open

2954
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,239
communications

2955
01:51:16,239 --> 01:51:17,760
the internet does what the internet does

2956
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,880
best which is mess with them so some of

2957
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,159
these are recordings of um

2958
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:26,560
people using this system to discover

2959
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,119
uh russians operating on a frequency and

2960
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:31,520
then moments later the recording turns

2961
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,679
into a rick roll so somebody figured out

2962
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:36,400
how to transmit on that same frequency

2963
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,880
and jam russian communications in an

2964
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,040
active war with rick rowling which is

2965
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,159
like we live in the future this is

2966
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:44,080
absurd um and then there were people

2967
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,639
like uh pushing ukrainian propaganda

2968
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:49,199
onto russian communication channels um

2969
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:50,560
and then if you're handy and you can

2970
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:52,480
understand russian or if you're even

2971
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,480
more handy than me you can like

2972
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,000
open 10 of these things in different

2973
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,080
tabs and then pipe that into like text

2974
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,719
to speech or speech to text rather so

2975
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,000
then you can have a blotter and then you

2976
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,599
can search those for keywords like you

2977
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,760
could go nuts with this if you piped

2978
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,840
something like this into opencv you

2979
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:12,239
could go wild um but uh like it's

2980
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:14,560
insane that you can like today at home

2981
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:15,760
from you know your living room in

2982
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,440
another country with just a laptop and

2983
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,840
next to no resources you can like have

2984
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,840
eyes and ears into a foreign country and

2985
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,280
then to that end if you can find a way

2986
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,840
to transmit you can mess with a foreign

2987
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:28,000
invading uh an army because they're

2988
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,599
using terrible radios that's just

2989
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:30,960
mind-blowing like you have to sit down

2990
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,159
and just be like wow we really do live

2991
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:33,599
in the future

2992
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,440
um so um

2993
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:38,159
this was fairly recent this was may 5th

2994
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,719
or may sorry may 3rd

2995
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:42,239
about a month ago

2996
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:46,239
the home assistant project um created a

2997
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:48,560
hook for what is called ukraine alert

2998
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,400
and ukraine alert is an app that was

2999
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,320
released that

3000
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:53,199
um

3001
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:54,480
it basically gives you like a map of

3002
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,400
ukraine and gives you an alert saying

3003
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,480
this area has airaid sirens going off or

3004
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,639
this area is under bombardment so now

3005
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:01,679
you can

3006
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,440
use that because it's an api you can

3007
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,199
just talk to that's public

3008
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:07,199
if you were handy enough you could say

3009
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,040
oh well i have all these cameras and i

3010
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,960
know that they're in this region and now

3011
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,639
i have this api that tells me if the

3012
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:15,199
region is taking fire so if you glue

3013
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:16,880
those things together or like monkey

3014
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,719
island them together

3015
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:20,320
you can say

3016
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,400
this area is taking bombardment so these

3017
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,599
cameras

3018
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:24,719
should be the interesting ones that you

3019
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:26,480
can maybe float to the top or you can

3020
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,239
say full screen them or something like

3021
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:30,080
it's it's weird to me that you can now

3022
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,520
say you're like home assistant we'll

3023
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,280
talk to cameras too i'm not necessarily

3024
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:34,800
saying you should use home assistant for

3025
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:36,320
this because it's not really the right

3026
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:39,040
tool but if you were bored enough

3027
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,520
you could you could embos you could put

3028
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,199
point home assistant at several of these

3029
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:45,599
cameras and then uh write a rule that

3030
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:46,719
said if

3031
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,080
um

3032
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,400
that region is under bombardment you can

3033
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,239
like float them to the top or like push

3034
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:54,320
the stream to your phone or like notify

3035
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,080
it's it's we live in the future and it's

3036
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,480
really weird here um but yeah it's like

3037
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,719
and this this this is a month old so

3038
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:02,560
even more interesting stuff is coming so

3039
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:05,599
um to that end i i wrote a uh

3040
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:07,599
again with bash a little two-line bash

3041
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,440
script that there's a website out there

3042
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,280
called max mind which will if you get a

3043
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:14,480
free api key you can um

3044
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,480
give it an ip or host name and it will

3045
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,080
give you like a geographic or rough

3046
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,440
geographic

3047
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:22,000
readout of where that thing is so you

3048
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,159
find an ip it's a webcam it seems

3049
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:25,440
interesting it's got stuff on it you

3050
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:26,480
want to watch

3051
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,840
you want to put it on a map or you want

3052
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,360
to know where it is

3053
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:31,360
you can ask max mind and max mind will

3054
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:32,639
just tell you what city it's in and

3055
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:34,719
generally speaking that's good enough

3056
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:36,159
because you can tell what direction the

3057
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:37,679
camera is pointing if you pay attention

3058
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:38,960
to the shadows and there's a bunch of

3059
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,280
like if you follow um bellingcat on

3060
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,040
twitter they have like courses about how

3061
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,480
to do this os and stuff so you can say

3062
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,400
based on the position of the sun and

3063
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,080
where the shadows are like the camera is

3064
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,840
aimed to generally do west

3065
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,520
and based on this architecture here or

3066
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:53,280
there's this obelisk like ukraine really

3067
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,040
likes their obelisks they have dozens of

3068
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,199
them so if you oh it's aimed at an

3069
01:54:57,199 --> 01:54:59,440
obelisk okay cool we can see okay the

3070
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,199
camera's here and there's a road you can

3071
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:03,840
take the time to go through and like

3072
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,440
find cameras

3073
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:08,239
like this is a map that i made on on

3074
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:10,880
google maps of where the tv antenna

3075
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,480
camera was so the camera is where that

3076
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:15,040
big pin was and the um

3077
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,280
tv antenna is like

3078
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,040
i think it might be just off frame to

3079
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,119
the top right but the idea was like the

3080
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:23,040
camera was attached to a an apartment

3081
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:24,560
building like on a on a really high

3082
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,239
floor and so you do that enough times

3083
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:27,679
and you end up with this interesting

3084
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:30,000
sort of semi-robust scenario where you

3085
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,480
have a map with like your vectors of

3086
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,760
where the cameras are pointing and then

3087
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,360
you have this web sdr you can listen to

3088
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,679
crazy stuff happening there and like you

3089
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:39,199
spend a little while doing this stuff

3090
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:40,480
and suddenly you have like a hollywood

3091
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,560
style like ncis war room going on in

3092
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:43,920
your living room with like you got eyes

3093
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:45,040
and ears into a foreign country and

3094
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,040
multiple cameras you can roll back time

3095
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,639
for a week and it's like

3096
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:49,920
kind of wild which you can do for free

3097
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,920
now uh imagine if there was a budget

3098
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,679
like imagine if this was like a research

3099
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:54,880
project or there was like a think tank

3100
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,119
or something attached to this

3101
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:57,920
so

3102
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:00,159
uh i i stopped doing this only because

3103
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:01,840
the camera started falling off and i

3104
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,040
thought it was kind of silly to have

3105
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:05,760
like 30 cameras on a map where like by

3106
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,280
the time i finish putting the camera on

3107
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,440
the map the camera's not online anymore

3108
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,199
uh so this is cool for a while but i

3109
01:56:11,199 --> 01:56:12,239
guess it has better practical

3110
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:13,599
applications for cameras that have a bit

3111
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:16,560
more longevity um so

3112
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,920
some considerations if you want to play

3113
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,440
with this sort of technology yourself is

3114
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:20,880
that uh

3115
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,719
imbibing rtsp streams and then

3116
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:24,080
converting them to a different format

3117
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,599
and shooting them back out to a browser

3118
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:27,360
takes a lot of cpu so like you're not

3119
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,639
gonna be able to do this with like the

3120
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:31,440
lowest tier ec2 free stuff you're gonna

3121
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,199
want eight processors you're gonna want

3122
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:35,360
a bunch of ram um

3123
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,719
uh

3124
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:38,560
you're gonna need some resources like

3125
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:39,840
it's hard to do this part for free the

3126
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,599
only reason i was able to do the shinobi

3127
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:43,440
stuff that i was able to do is because

3128
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,119
we have a really buff work server that

3129
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:46,800
we have some back end things running on

3130
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,960
that's largely sleeping right now it's

3131
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,159
like 48 cores and 256 gigs of ram so i

3132
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:54,400
just gave it to that thing and i'm not

3133
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,920
close to pegging the cpu but i'm hitting

3134
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,560
like 50 cpu utilization with like 40

3135
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,840
cameras on this thing so stuff to take

3136
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:02,639
into account um and the other thing is

3137
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:04,000
networking right so if you're sending

3138
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,480
packets from the west coast of the us to

3139
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:09,199
ukraine uh there's a lot of routers and

3140
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:11,520
switching equipment between your server

3141
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:12,960
and the cameras you're talking to and

3142
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,480
stuff goes down a lot and packets can

3143
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:16,880
jumble around a lot so like something to

3144
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:19,119
consider is like set up a proxy

3145
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:21,679
physically in a country nearby and then

3146
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:24,080
do like do the shinobi install there and

3147
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:26,239
then watch the shinobi stream across the

3148
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:28,639
internet because watching that stream is

3149
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:30,239
uh it's going to be higher bandwidth but

3150
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:31,760
you're going to have more stable video

3151
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,320
or even then collect everything closer

3152
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:35,440
physically to wherever it is you're

3153
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,599
trying to watch and um take into account

3154
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:39,920
like global routing or hey maybe turkey

3155
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,840
will decide they hate youtube again and

3156
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,679
bgp advertised that they're youtube and

3157
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:45,119
now half of google disappears off the

3158
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:46,960
internet because bgp is fun and everyone

3159
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:49,360
loves bgp and this is why we all drink

3160
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:50,880
so like

3161
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,719
the internet's weird and it's a giant

3162
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,560
sort of free-for-all so you'll that sort

3163
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,320
of stuff affects your ability to do this

3164
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,000
kind of research because like suddenly

3165
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,040
um

3166
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,960
you know an argument an isp is having

3167
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,880
somewhere on like the eastern seaboard

3168
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,880
of the u.s causes routes to change and

3169
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:06,159
as the routes change then all your

3170
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:07,440
cameras go down because now you can't

3171
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,639
reach ukraine anymore i'm like wow

3172
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:09,679
somebody else is having a fight on the

3173
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:11,520
internet and my research falls over

3174
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,199
because of it so there's stuff like that

3175
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:14,480
to take into consideration if you want

3176
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:17,040
to do this kind of work but

3177
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,480
if you don't want to watch another

3178
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,239
country get invaded and you have a more

3179
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:21,679
practical application for this sort of

3180
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:23,920
thing um let's say you're on a red team

3181
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,360
like maybe jason

3182
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,599
and you want to know hey i would like to

3183
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:28,560
know

3184
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:29,840
if the cops are going to show up because

3185
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:32,400
i too have been in a position where i

3186
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,159
was on a red team and the cops showed up

3187
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:36,159
with guns and dogs and it makes for a

3188
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:37,760
cool story but i never want to do that

3189
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:39,280
again that sucks i do not want to get

3190
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:40,880
shot on the job i'm a dork i do dork

3191
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,719
things i don't do like bullet things

3192
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:43,599
it's like

3193
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:45,840
uh so um

3194
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,080
the concept or conceptually saying like

3195
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,840
if you're doing like a full a full

3196
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,199
spectrum engagement on a customer where

3197
01:58:51,199 --> 01:58:52,719
they say like do everything to us and

3198
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:54,719
maybe you go in over the wire first

3199
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:56,480
if you get their cameras and that's an

3200
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,000
interesting topic of discussion because

3201
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,840
you'll have like a litany of different

3202
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,599
type of camera technologies and camera

3203
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:03,440
services that like the the security

3204
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,880
guards will use and usually the security

3205
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,840
guards in the company are like an

3206
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:07,520
outsourced thing like their

3207
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,239
uh

3208
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:10,480
contr contractors uh the company or

3209
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:11,760
sometimes the building management people

3210
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,080
will own the camera system um in almost

3211
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:16,639
every circumstance fun fact that camera

3212
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:19,440
system will export rtsp streams of each

3213
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:22,320
camera so if you have your own

3214
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,480
like a shinobi server for example you

3215
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:25,440
can

3216
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:28,960
export video streams from the camera or

3217
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,239
from the building management or the

3218
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:32,000
company's camera systems without

3219
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,840
affecting their ability to do their jobs

3220
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,360
without asking for credentials without

3221
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:37,119
having them change what they're doing so

3222
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:38,400
if you're on a red team and you happen

3223
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:39,760
to get those credentials or maybe they

3224
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,840
were kind enough to leave them in a wiki

3225
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,920
or on a post-it note on their desk or

3226
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,520
any other place that i have found them

3227
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,840
um you can just ask the camera system

3228
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,119
hey give me all your cameras and then

3229
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,040
you can pipe them into your own shinobi

3230
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,960
install so you can be on the red team

3231
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,239
watching all the cameras and you can do

3232
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:55,440
like that whole look was that movie

3233
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,440
italian job the seth green one where

3234
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:58,800
he's like in the airport doing the hacky

3235
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,080
hacky thing and he's got all the cameras

3236
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:02,000
you can do that like you

3237
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,440
like hollywood was right who knew but

3238
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,199
they were right like 15 years in the

3239
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:07,520
past like 15 years ago we're throwing

3240
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:08,800
you know bottles of the tv saying no

3241
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,159
that's bs that doesn't happen in real

3242
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:11,440
life and here we are 20 years later

3243
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,800
saying well now that are actually right

3244
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:15,119
now i got to eat crow so

3245
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:17,040
um and on from the blue team side you

3246
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,400
can do the same thing right so like

3247
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,320
let's say you're on the blue team and um

3248
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,480
you have uh you're in a leased office in

3249
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:23,840
a building and you take security

3250
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,599
seriously and if you do thumbs up

3251
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:28,800
because not everyone does um you want uh

3252
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,400
you know you want to give 110 you're

3253
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,520
like i want to do more than the bare

3254
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,760
minimum i want to see when the red team

3255
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,440
is coming because like one of the big

3256
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,760
gold stars you can wear as a blue teamer

3257
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:39,040
is catching the red team right so if you

3258
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:40,080
can catch the red team you're in good

3259
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:40,960
shape

3260
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,159
uh so

3261
02:00:42,159 --> 02:00:44,480
you want to catch the red team uh you

3262
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:46,400
add into your sim who's talking to the

3263
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:49,360
cameras cause who else is gonna talk to

3264
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:50,880
me and maybe jason a couple other people

3265
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:51,679
are gonna be the ones that are like

3266
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:53,520
we're after the cameras because we're

3267
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:55,920
we're crazy people if you find you find

3268
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:57,520
that stuff in your in your pcaps and in

3269
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,360
your logs uh you're off to a good start

3270
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:00,560
because the minute somebody starts going

3271
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,719
after the cameras like no employee

3272
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:04,239
sitting in the sales floor or like

3273
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:05,920
nobody in the design area is going to

3274
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,280
care about the cameras for the building

3275
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,440
like only us crazy people will so it's a

3276
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,960
very big it's like shooting a flare in

3277
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,560
the air yeah the red team is on the land

3278
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,800
and they're looking for stuff um but

3279
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,080
yeah so from the blue team side of

3280
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:17,920
things you can use the exact same

3281
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,239
mechanic like 100 congruency there to

3282
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:22,560
say i'm going to imbibe our tsp streams

3283
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:23,920
and pipe them into our own system and

3284
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,199
then you can do really cool things you

3285
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:26,400
can say like

3286
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:27,840
we have a front door camera and we can

3287
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:30,880
see that a person badged in but the

3288
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,400
the person is not someone that we

3289
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:35,760
recognize and the badge they used is

3290
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,199
assigned to an employee that's on

3291
02:01:37,199 --> 02:01:40,400
vacation in tahiti right now

3292
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:43,440
interesting so whereas otherwise uh you

3293
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:45,040
maybe not have you may not have access

3294
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:46,400
to the bad readers or you may not have

3295
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,000
access to the camera infrastructure so

3296
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
like things get wild really fast when

3297
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,679
you start taking like stuff in meat

3298
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:53,280
space and correlating it with stuff in

3299
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:56,080
like packet space um

3300
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:57,199
and and

3301
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:59,440
i was it's it's it's pleasing to say

3302
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:01,280
that like cool i accidentally stumbled

3303
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:02,480
across a thing that'll let you do that

3304
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,159
so like i encourage everyone if you want

3305
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:06,320
to mess with this stuff uh go play with

3306
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,639
shinobi add some cameras to it um if you

3307
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:09,679
can find the cameras in your own

3308
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:11,360
businesses do this and see what happens

3309
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,880
because you know the world's your oyster

3310
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,960
at that point um these are things that

3311
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:16,400
like what i

3312
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,880
discovered a really uh amusing quote a

3313
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,360
really poignant one recently with it uh

3314
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:22,719
let's see if i can recite it from memory

3315
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:24,159
correctly it's uh

3316
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:26,000
the best swordsman in the world doesn't

3317
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,840
have to fear the second best swordsman

3318
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,360
in the world the best swordsman in the

3319
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,119
world has to fear the fool because you

3320
02:02:31,119 --> 02:02:32,560
have no idea what the fool is going to

3321
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:34,960
do so from a technical standpoint we're

3322
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,320
you know most of us we're i'm

3323
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:39,760
self-proclaimed dork uh we tend to try

3324
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:42,159
to solve for the second best swordsman

3325
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:44,719
in the world we try to solve for

3326
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:48,159
o days we try and solve for mlai based

3327
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:50,560
solutions that are powered by

3328
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,880
400 blockchains eight hamsters and four

3329
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,159
quantum computers that are supposed to

3330
02:02:54,159 --> 02:02:56,560
like magically wave you know a wand and

3331
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:59,040
solve for every possible variant of

3332
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,960
memory corruption and stuff like that

3333
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:02,639
and like you're up here working and like

3334
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:04,639
i've spent 25 million dollars on this

3335
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:06,480
research to stop nation state threats

3336
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,000
doing all this blah blah blah blah and

3337
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,440
i'm over here on your camera that's got

3338
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:11,520
admin admin as the creds watching your

3339
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:13,199
teams do the thing and i'm like oh so

3340
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:14,400
they're going to this oh i just

3341
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:15,520
overheard where they were going for

3342
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,480
lunch maybe i'll meet them there like

3343
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:19,920
the things that we're solving for from a

3344
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,199
technical perspective tend to be really

3345
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:22,719
really complex and really cool sounding

3346
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:24,960
and really great but like

3347
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,320
where the problems

3348
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:28,639
are tend to be in like

3349
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:30,560
acid inventory and like what's on your

3350
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,080
perimeter and when was the last time you

3351
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:33,679
know you patched apache struts for

3352
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:35,920
example so um

3353
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:37,199
play with it it's a lot of fun it gets

3354
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:39,920
wild pretty fast and with that uh i'm i

3355
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,520
think i'm a minute over but if i have

3356
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:43,040
time for

3357
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,040
drive time for questions yeah i think we

3358
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:47,760
have time for uh one or two cool any

3359
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,920
questions guys

3360
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:52,400
no come on don't be shy must be someone

3361
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,480
yeah we're i'm american so i'm spoiled

3362
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:56,719
by having uh uh audiences that interact

3363
02:03:56,719 --> 02:03:58,079
and throw things and shout so like

3364
02:03:58,079 --> 02:04:00,719
please don't be shy

3365
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:03,440
no anyone oh well uh if not you can

3366
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:05,119
always find damn oh we got nelson fire

3367
02:04:05,119 --> 02:04:06,800
one ready

3368
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,480
oh orbital orbit is a platform that

3369
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:10,480
we're building so uh we started uh my

3370
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,000
company phobos group as a services

3371
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,159
company but we're pivoting to doing a uh

3372
02:04:14,159 --> 02:04:15,920
a platform so orbital is a thing that we

3373
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,040
built that does

3374
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,159
um

3375
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:20,480
like hardcore enumeration of perimeters

3376
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:21,760
so like you aim this at a company and

3377
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:23,520
it'll find uh

3378
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:25,199
perimeter infrastructure that maybe

3379
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:26,560
folks don't know about

3380
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,079
or perimeter infrastructure that other

3381
02:04:28,079 --> 02:04:30,480
tools say doesn't have any known bugs or

3382
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:33,280
known cves but maybe it's like the text

3383
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:34,960
says click here to complete your

3384
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:37,199
wordpress installation which you'll look

3385
02:04:37,199 --> 02:04:38,800
at that and say well that's instant

3386
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:40,560
shells but because there's no cve

3387
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,239
associated with it like all the other

3388
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:44,239
tools will say that it's not a problem

3389
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:46,079
so we built a thing because we thought

3390
02:04:46,079 --> 02:04:47,199
like

3391
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:49,280
fundamentally for example like

3392
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,480
the way that we do

3393
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:52,000
vulnerability management hasn't changed

3394
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,320
in 20 years like 20 years ago when i was

3395
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,320
using retina's ei the technique for

3396
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:58,880
doing vulnerability assessment was like

3397
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:00,560
connect to a port grab a banner and then

3398
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:01,920
string match what's in that banner to

3399
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,520
like stuff to see if there's a known

3400
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:05,760
exploit we're still doing that and it's

3401
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:07,520
been more than 20 years so we were like

3402
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:09,520
well that's super old we're going to try

3403
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:11,760
another way so that's our

3404
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:14,320
our attempt to try and move the needle

3405
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,320
yeah thanks for asking

3406
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:17,199
all right

3407
02:05:17,199 --> 02:05:18,719
thank you so much dan cheers thanks for

3408
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:21,840
having me

3409
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:25,920
all right thanks that's awesome

3410
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:28,560
okay um so we're gonna give you guys

3411
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,159
like 10 minutes to grab some coffee

3412
02:05:30,159 --> 02:05:31,760
before the next speaker

3413
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:33,840
i also wanted to mention if you go on

3414
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,800
twitter please do and use our hashtag

3415
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,719
hashtag securityfest

3416
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:41,119
also tomorrow this is not in the

3417
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:42,480
schedule yet i don't think but we're

3418
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:44,159
going to have a panel to wrap up the

3419
02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:46,560
conference and we're going to do a wrong

3420
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,560
questions only panel for the speakers

3421
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,800
are wrong answers only good questions

3422
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,159
wrong answers

3423
02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:54,560
um so you'll be seeing them there

3424
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:56,639
definitely um

3425
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:57,840
so we want you guys to ask some

3426
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:00,159
questions so please go on twitter go to

security fest panel and ask us questions

3430
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,400
and we'll incorporate those tomorrow

3431

3435
02:19:05,679 --> 02:19:07,840
i'm married have two kids and i really

3436
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,120
like to do

3437
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:11,679
hiking and trail running and actually

3438
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:14,478
yesterday i went out to the ghouta laden

3439
02:19:14,478 --> 02:19:16,000
trail

3440
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,040
nearby it's it's pretty nice

3441
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:20,398
here

3442
02:19:20,398 --> 02:19:21,120
so

3443
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,040
the agenda um

3444
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:25,120
i will talk about 10 different

3445
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:28,318
techniques on mac os which can

3446
02:19:28,318 --> 02:19:30,000
help you persist

3447
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,718
if you are a marvel or a teamer or pen

3448
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:34,959
tester or

3449
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:37,519
whatever

3450
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:38,879
so

3451
02:19:38,879 --> 02:19:43,199
how many macos users we have here

3452
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:45,439
some

3453
02:19:45,439 --> 02:19:49,359
so how is oil started uh back in 2014

3454
02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:52,160
patrick waddle

3455
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:54,560
gave a talk and wrote a white paper

3456
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:57,359
about mother persistence on mac os and

3457
02:19:57,359 --> 02:19:59,520
he explored one of the

3458
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:01,920
most common options mother used for

3459
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,760
persisting

3460
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:05,200
and

3461
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:07,280
there is this guy called adam from the

3462
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,399
uk

3463
02:20:08,399 --> 02:20:09,920
goes by the

3464
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:12,800
handle hexacorn on twitter and he has a

3465
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:15,439
series for windows called the beyond the

3466
02:20:15,439 --> 02:20:17,680
good old run keys

3467
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:20,080
and he has documented like over

3468
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:22,000
100 persistent

3469
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,479
uh for windows

3470
02:20:24,479 --> 02:20:25,439
and

3471
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:27,520
i also found so i don't usually deal

3472
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:30,399
with mac os mother but i kinda used to

3473
02:20:30,399 --> 02:20:33,040
at least read the write-up or the the

3474
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:35,680
research going uh around them

3475
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:38,479
and i realized that actually 99 of them

3476
02:20:38,479 --> 02:20:40,800
uses steel like launch agents

3477
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:44,000
and probably because it just works

3478
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,920
and i started to wonder okay can we do

3479
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,920
better or are there any other options

3480
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:51,040
beyond what's already documented

3481
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:53,600
because i'm pretty sure that eventually

3482
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,240
it will show up so

3483
02:20:56,240 --> 02:21:00,080
the mac os or the macbooks as a platform

3484
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:00,960
it's

3485
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:03,359
becoming more and more more widespread

3486
02:21:03,359 --> 02:21:06,720
actually i was surprised that in the us

3487
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:07,760
now it

3488
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:11,439
takes like 15 percent market shares

3489
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:13,760
versus a couple of years ago it was like

3490
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:14,960
eight

3491
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:16,080
um

3492
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:17,600
so as it will be

3493
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:20,160
more widespread moreover outdoors filter

3494
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:21,520
more and more

3495
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:23,840
for max although we all know that there

3496
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:26,479
are no viruses for mac

3497
02:21:26,479 --> 02:21:28,800
so i also started a series

3498
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:32,160
called beyond the good old launch agents

3499
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,640
why launch agents it's like the run key

3500
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:37,439
on windows so that's the most common way

3501
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:40,600
to persist

3502
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:44,080
so i started this blog post now i have

3503
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:46,479
like 29

3504
02:21:46,479 --> 02:21:47,840
parts to it

3505
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:49,840
and i selected my

3506
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:52,399
10 favorite out of them but there are

3507
02:21:52,399 --> 02:21:53,680
many more than

3508
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:55,840
just these i will present so my first

3509
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:59,120
favorite is the shell startup wise

3510
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:01,040
so this is a common

3511
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:03,439
this can be a common persistence for

3512
02:22:03,439 --> 02:22:05,520
not just mac os but basically any nyx

3513
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:09,520
base system linux unix anything anything

3514
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:11,920
that has zsh bash and all the shell

3515
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:13,600
environments

3516
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:16,560
uh on mac os zsh is the default although

3517
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:19,120
it still has the older ones as well

3518
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:21,439
so all these shell and all these shell

3519
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:22,399
environments

3520
02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:25,359
have various config files like probably

3521
02:22:25,359 --> 02:22:27,439
zsh rc

3522
02:22:27,439 --> 02:22:29,439
is the most common one it sits in the

3523
02:22:29,439 --> 02:22:32,640
user's directory and you could define

3524
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,439
their aliases some startup scripts

3525
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:37,200
whatever you need for your shell

3526
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,319
environment

3527
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:40,880
uh bash has the same bash rc

3528
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:44,000
and there are like zsh n z logins the

3529
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,520
logout

3530
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:48,880
like z login is executed when you log in

3531
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:52,160
z logout is executed when you log out

3532
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:55,359
there is the dot profile for i believe

3533
02:22:55,359 --> 02:22:57,120
a stage

3534
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:00,560
and usually all of them has a user

3535
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:03,439
mode settings in your user home folder

3536
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:06,319
and then there is a system-wide one

3537
02:23:06,319 --> 02:23:09,520
uh which on mac os sits under the slash

3538
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:11,439
etc

3539
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:15,120
uh directory so basically if you put

3540
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:17,760
any bash script in these files it will

3541
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,720
be

3542
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,800
run whenever a shell environment is

3543
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:23,520
started now mac os doesn't start a shell

3544
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:25,280
environment by default but whenever you

3545
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:27,200
open terminal it will start a shell

3546
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:28,399
environment

3547
02:23:28,399 --> 02:23:32,479
and all of these will be executed

3548
02:23:32,479 --> 02:23:34,240
now beyond that

3549
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:37,120
uh why this can be interesting

3550
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:40,000
uh mac os has this concept of privacy

3551
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,280
protection

3552
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:44,720
uh which is called the tcc framework

3553
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:47,120
and

3554
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:48,800
so these are all the problems when you

3555
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:50,960
get that hey this application wants to

3556
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:53,040
access your camera this application

3557
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,120
wants to access your microphone this

3558
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:57,040
application wants to access your desktop

3559
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:58,960
folder this application wants to access

3560
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:00,720
your documents folder

3561
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:02,479
this application wants to do i don't

3562
02:24:02,479 --> 02:24:04,399
know capture keystroke do screen

3563
02:24:04,399 --> 02:24:05,520
recording

3564
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:07,120
and actually even if the application

3565
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:09,359
runs as the use as the

3566
02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:10,880
normal user

3567
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:13,600
he cannot access these resources because

3568
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:15,680
apple considers them as private so you

3569
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:17,680
need to actually

3570
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:20,319
give each application permission for

3571
02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:22,160
each right

3572
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:24,160
and now there is a strike called full

3573
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:25,760
disk access

3574
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:28,640
which is required for

3575
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:32,640
many things on mac os and and it's more

3576
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,399
and more required

3577
02:24:34,399 --> 02:24:36,880
so i think power users or like

3578
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:40,560
developers or or i.t people

3579
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:44,640
will typically give terminal

3580
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:46,640
full disk access

3581
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:49,280
now the problem with this is if you

3582
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:52,640
persist through share startup files

3583
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:55,600
terminal will start the shell and that

3584
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:58,319
shell will inherit terminals privacy

3585
02:24:58,319 --> 02:24:59,200
rights

3586
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:02,880
so if terminal had like full disk access

3587
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:04,319
your shell

3588
02:25:04,319 --> 02:25:06,319
script will inherit that and you will

3589
02:25:06,319 --> 02:25:07,760
also get

3590
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:08,840
full disk

3591
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:11,840
access so but just to show what i talk

3592
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:13,280
about

3593
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:15,359
if you haven't seen this

3594
02:25:15,359 --> 02:25:18,880
so let's say like the messages

3595
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:22,160
the imessages is a protected location so

3596
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:25,840
if i try to list that

3597
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:28,560
i got operation not permitted

3598
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:30,720
now the only way i can actually get

3599
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:33,280
access to this location is give full

3600
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:35,200
disk access to terminal

3601
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:38,800
no i don't need to restart it and now i

3602
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:41,920
can list it now if i

3603
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:43,680
revoke the access

3604
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:45,600
no don't restart

3605
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:47,520
it's again operation not permitted so

3606
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:50,560
this is this is a privacy

3607
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:52,560
protection feature

3608
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:54,160
so if

3609
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:55,600
uh

3610
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:58,720
i highly recommend if your mac user

3611
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:01,520
don't give anything full disk access

3612
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:04,160
unless it's really needed like there are

3613
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:06,880
some applications like

3614
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:08,880
anything that implements or uses the

3615
02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:11,760
endpoint security framework for example

3616
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:13,760
they have to have full disk access in

3617
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,800
order to function

3618
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:18,319
anyhow

3619
02:26:18,319 --> 02:26:20,800
so how we can detect these as blue

3620
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:22,240
teamers

3621
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:24,880
so just monitor for change any of these

3622
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:27,040
files i think if it's uh there might be

3623
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:28,720
some force positive especially with

3624
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:30,720
power users

3625
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:33,439
uh but generally average users probably

3626
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:35,920
don't modify these

3627
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:36,960
files

3628
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,960
also monitor for the execution of cs

3629
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,840
chsh

3630
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:43,760
which is a command to change the shell

3631
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:46,000
environment so you can change the

3632
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,319
default shell from zsh to bash for

3633
02:26:48,319 --> 02:26:50,319
example mac os

3634
02:26:50,319 --> 02:26:54,080
with this command also monitor for ch ch

3635
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,520
pass

3636
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:56,720
execution

3637
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:59,120
because that can also change many

3638
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:01,200
attributes

3639
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:03,359
concerning the shell

3640
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:05,280
and i believe this might apply to us on

3641
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:07,120
this other nix based

3642
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,160
system

3643
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:10,000
so the next one is the pluggable

3644
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,040
authentication modules the pam

3645
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:15,040
this is also something that you will

3646
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:17,920
find not just on mac os but on other nix

3647
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:19,439
based system

3648
02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:21,920
it has its origins from red hat but

3649
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:24,240
nowadays

3650
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:26,720
i believe most system will implement it

3651
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:29,120
basically what it does it allows you to

3652
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:31,520
install third-party

3653
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:33,680
plugins to perform various

3654
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:35,760
authentication related

3655
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:40,080
operations so there are four facilities

3656
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:42,720
defined in pem one is out account

3657
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:44,399
session and password

3658
02:27:44,399 --> 02:27:46,960
and these are related to authentication

3659
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:48,960
account management session management

3660
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,960
and password management

3661
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:54,240
and all the configurations files for pam

3662
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:59,359
can be found under the slash etc pam d

3663
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:00,800
directory

3664
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:03,600
so how such a configuration file looks

3665
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:05,040
like

3666
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:07,280
it said it has three columns

3667
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:10,640
the first one defines the the facility

3668
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:13,120
like what we just described the out

3669
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:15,439
account password session

3670
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:18,080
the next column defines the policy and

3671
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:21,680
the last is the actual module that will

3672
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:24,960
implement uh that functionality

3673
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:27,600
now

3674
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,600
the the second column is interesting

3675
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:31,680
because it will define if

3676
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:32,880
uh

3677
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:36,000
how the result of that module is treated

3678
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,720
so if it's req these are executed in top

3679
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:42,160
down order so and if there is a required

3680
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:44,880
if it fails then the entire

3681
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:47,840
operation or the entire result will fail

3682
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:49,920
so like there is a required module to

3683
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,080
pass authentication and leave that first

3684
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:54,800
then authentication will fail

3685
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:57,280
uh optional it will be ignored if there

3686
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:00,560
is a required one but sufficient

3687
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:02,720
uh if it succeed

3688
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:06,479
then there will be no further checks

3689
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:08,960
so if we like put a new entry at the

3690
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:11,600
very top and say okay it's sufficient

3691
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:14,720
and it will succeed then nothing else

3692
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:16,479
will be checked

3693
02:29:16,479 --> 02:29:19,280
uh there are two interesting default

3694
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:23,200
uh pen modules one is the pam permit.so

3695
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,880
it will just return success for

3696
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:27,520
everything without any checks and there

3697
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:31,120
is the pam uh deny.so which will just

3698
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:33,120
deny everything

3699
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:35,200
they are building

3700
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:38,560
uh so what we can do for example is

3701
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:40,160
create a new

3702
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:41,920
uh entry

3703
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:44,720
and say let's say for ssh

3704
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:47,520
and say out like authentication

3705
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:48,720
sufficient

3706
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:50,240
pam

3707
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:52,560
which means that whenever you try to ssh

3708
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:55,760
into a mac uh it will succeed and not

3709
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:57,760
prompt you for a password so this is

3710
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:00,640
actually also a nice backdoor

3711
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:02,720
you can do the same for sudo

3712
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:06,479
just say okay out sufficient pam permit

3713
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:08,399
and

3714
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:10,240
every time you type sudo you will not be

3715
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:12,800
prompted for password uh you just get

3716
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:15,439
roots uh straight away

3717
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:16,720
now

3718
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:19,200
because spam is extendable you can we

3719
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:22,880
can also load our own plugin and

3720
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:25,120
do really whatever we want

3721
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:27,920
uh this code here is just like an empty

3722
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:29,040
template

3723
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,439
uh probably looks like pam permit it

3724
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:32,960
will just

3725
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:35,120
return success for everything

3726
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:36,080
but

3727
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:38,800
you can add your own logic and do

3728
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:40,160
whatever

3729
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:43,760
you want your on your own

3730
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:47,280
marvel red team implant whatever

3731
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:50,000
so the reason we can load plugins in the

3732
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:50,960
pam

3733
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:53,840
framework on mac os

3734
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:56,720
is because the

3735
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:58,720
all of the services have this

3736
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:00,720
entitlement chrome apple private

3737
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:03,840
security clear library validation

3738
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:05,920
which is required to load any anything

3739
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:08,160
third party by default on mac os you

3740
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:11,200
cannot load the third party die lib

3741
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:13,680
dylib is the dll on mac os

3742
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:14,880
into

3743
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:18,080
a platform application

3744
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:19,439
because

3745
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:21,760
process injection is a thing on macos

3746
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:23,840
because

3747
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,399
all of the processes has entitlements

3748
02:31:26,399 --> 02:31:28,880
like various entitlements which gives

3749
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:31,439
the processes various rights uh for

3750
02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:34,720
example privacy rights that

3751
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:37,760
like facetime has a right to access the

3752
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:40,560
camera without any prompt

3753
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:42,560
and so if you can inject into that

3754
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:44,000
process you gain access to the

3755
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,399
entitlement and this is why like

3756
02:31:46,399 --> 02:31:48,319
generally processed injection is a big

3757
02:31:48,319 --> 02:31:51,040
no on mac os

3758
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:54,560
so how we can detect this persistence uh

3759
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:57,600
now first of all the good thing nowadays

3760
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:58,399
is

3761
02:31:58,399 --> 02:32:01,120
the the privacy framework will protect

3762
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:03,920
the pam configurations files so if you

3763
02:32:03,920 --> 02:32:06,080
try to modify these the user will

3764
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:08,319
actually get a prompt that hey you need

3765
02:32:08,319 --> 02:32:11,439
to give this application system

3766
02:32:11,439 --> 02:32:13,680
administration right and if he clicks

3767
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:15,840
deny

3768
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:17,680
then it will not succeed

3769
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:19,840
although probably on macos we have this

3770
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:23,600
prompt fatigue so like

3771
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:25,359
there is an insane amount of prom the

3772
02:32:25,359 --> 02:32:27,439
user get on mac os so they might just

3773
02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:29,600
click yeah sure go

3774
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:32,720
um so monitor the change

3775
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:35,760
monitor for the change of these files um

3776
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:38,399
all the config files

3777
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:40,880
and also if you have something like

3778
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:43,359
apmon or

3779
02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:45,840
i think the arc agent can also collect

3780
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:48,080
various um

3781
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:50,479
events from a mac if if you

3782
02:32:50,479 --> 02:32:52,720
use an enterprise environment

3783
02:32:52,720 --> 02:32:56,399
there is this es event type out a map

3784
02:32:56,399 --> 02:32:58,960
event coming from the endpoint security

3785
02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:01,359
framework which basically tells you what

3786
02:33:01,359 --> 02:33:04,399
kind of module die lib was loaded into a

3787
02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:05,359
process

3788
02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:07,920
so you might want to monitor for weird

3789
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:10,880
dye lips loaded into the ssh sudo or the

3790
02:33:10,880 --> 02:33:12,399
other services

3791
02:33:12,399 --> 02:33:14,319
uh because you

3792
02:33:14,319 --> 02:33:16,880
if you didn't install any

3793
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:19,120
any third party module and you know that

3794
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:21,120
you didn't install one

3795
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:24,720
now suddenly one showing up

3796
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:27,760
might be interesting

3797
02:33:27,760 --> 02:33:29,760
the third one as a persistent is

3798
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:31,280
hummerspoon

3799
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:33,680
this is an automation application so

3800
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:35,200
this is not

3801
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:37,040
something core to mac os but this is

3802
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:38,880
more like an application specific

3803
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:41,200
persistence but if someone has hammer

3804
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:42,720
spoon instead

3805
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:46,399
hammerspoon has an initialization script

3806
02:33:46,399 --> 02:33:48,960
located in the home folder the dot

3807
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:52,160
hammerspoon slash init.lua

3808
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:53,760
it's a lua script

3809
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:56,560
which i personally don't like

3810
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:57,760
that much

3811
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:00,840
but basically you can just do

3812
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:04,800
hs.execute then give their best

3813
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:07,760
script and then you can execute some

3814
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:09,439
bash

3815
02:34:09,439 --> 02:34:11,520
script easily and you don't need to deal

3816
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:12,720
with

3817
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:14,560
the more lua

3818
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:17,200
nuances although there are more examples

3819
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:20,560
on the application website

3820
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:25,700
also hammerspoon has a lot of

3821
02:34:25,700 --> 02:34:27,200
[Music]

3822
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:28,840
entitlements

3823
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:32,240
to ask for access for

3824
02:34:32,240 --> 02:34:34,399
various privacy related stuff like

3825
02:34:34,399 --> 02:34:36,800
camera

3826
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:39,439
calendars address book

3827
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:41,920
photos library and assuming the user

3828
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:44,880
already granted access then if

3829
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:48,479
hammerspoon will execute your script

3830
02:34:48,479 --> 02:34:49,840
you

3831
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:52,640
get these accesses as well so it's like

3832
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:56,640
tcc bypass at the same time

3833
02:34:56,720 --> 02:35:00,000
detection again it's very simple a valve

3834
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
first of all monitor for the change of

3835
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,280
this uh

3836
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:04,479
file

3837
02:35:04,479 --> 02:35:07,359
and also some weird child processes of

3838
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:10,080
hammer spoon

3839
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:12,399
so all this detection i talk about this

3840
02:35:12,399 --> 02:35:14,479
is probably more relevant in

3841
02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:17,120
enterprise environment when you

3842
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:19,600
when you log what's happening on on your

3843
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:22,240
mac devices

3844
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:24,960
so the first one is preference planes uh

3845
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:27,280
what are preference panes

3846
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:28,880
on mac os we have this system

3847
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:30,880
preferences

3848
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:32,080
application

3849
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:33,680
which is

3850
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:35,840
there to configure many

3851
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:38,560
settings on mac os

3852
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:42,000
and basically you can add new plugins uh

3853
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,120
to this

3854
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:45,520
i added one below

3855
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:48,399
persistent firm it has an apple logo

3856
02:35:48,399 --> 02:35:49,840
with a worm

3857
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:52,560
uh basically what you do is create a new

3858
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:55,680
bundle a prep paint bundle

3859
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:57,840
and place it inside the library

3860
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:00,240
preference paints directory

3861
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:02,720
and on the next time system preference

3862
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:05,840
is executed it will load your bundle

3863
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:08,880
and you will show up there uh

3864
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:11,520
basically you can just create a

3865
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:14,880
a bundle and add this single function

3866
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:16,160
and

3867
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:18,560
whenever it's loaded your code

3868
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:21,280
your code will be executed and that's

3869
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:22,560
all so it's

3870
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:25,279
quite simple

3871
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:30,479
but where where is your code loaded uh

3872
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:33,200
because it won't be system preferences

3873
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:36,560
that loads your actual plugin but it

3874
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:37,600
will be

3875
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:40,319
a process called legacy loader

3876
02:36:40,319 --> 02:36:41,520
and

3877
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:43,359
that will load your

3878
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:44,399
bundle

3879
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:46,800
this one also have the

3880
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:48,960
disable library validation entitlement

3881
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:51,760
so it can

3882
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:53,520
load it and nothing else so you don't

3883
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,399
get access to other fancy entitlements

3884
02:36:56,399 --> 02:36:57,680
if you were then that would be a

3885
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:01,439
vulnerability on mac os

3886
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:06,000
again detection monitor for any any new

3887
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,760
files in the preference panes directory

3888
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:10,560
and

3889
02:37:10,560 --> 02:37:12,880
anymore use loaded by the legacy loader

3890
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:14,560
process um

3891
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:16,160
because if

3892
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,399
if you don't use in your environment any

3893
02:37:18,399 --> 02:37:20,800
applications that

3894
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:23,680
have a custom preference base pane

3895
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:24,560
then

3896
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:26,960
this process shouldn't load anything

3897
02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:28,960
really

3898
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:31,600
next one screensaver

3899
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:34,160
this was first very very researched by

3900
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:37,600
leo pitt uh doomfist um on twitter and

3901
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:39,840
he has a very detailed blog post uh

3902
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:41,439
about it

3903
02:37:41,439 --> 02:37:43,680
basically the screensavers are also

3904
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:45,600
bundles on mac os

3905
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:49,040
so let me step back bundle on mac os is

3906
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:50,880
basically

3907
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:54,560
an application or

3908
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:57,120
it's basically a directory structure

3909
02:37:57,120 --> 02:38:00,880
with some defined content so bundle

3910
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:03,438
contains

3911
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:05,520
the main executable

3912
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:07,359
or the resource file the application

3913
02:38:07,359 --> 02:38:09,520
need

3914
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:12,720
configuration settings and

3915
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:15,760
maybe other frameworks other dye leaves

3916
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:19,520
so basically all of the applications are

3917
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:21,840
bundled into

3918
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:24,240
a single directory structure which

3919
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:26,319
contains everything the application

3920
02:38:26,319 --> 02:38:27,359
needs

3921
02:38:27,359 --> 02:38:28,479
and

3922
02:38:28,479 --> 02:38:30,720
but there are other bundles with very

3923
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:32,880
similar structure

3924
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:34,720
not just applications

3925
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:37,120
and for example screen saver is a dot

3926
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:38,800
saver

3927
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:40,560
bundle so the directory has the dot

3928
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:43,359
saver extension

3929
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:45,040
these are also saved

3930
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:48,640
in the library screen saver

3931
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:50,319
directory

3932
02:38:50,319 --> 02:38:51,439
and

3933
02:38:51,439 --> 02:38:53,439
it's very easy to create one because

3934
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:56,399
xcode the developer environment for mac

3935
02:38:56,399 --> 02:38:59,120
os has a template project

3936
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:01,359
so you can just start it

3937
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:04,160
put your code in every function uh

3938
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:08,000
listed there and there you go it's

3939
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:11,280
it's pretty straightforward

3940
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:14,160
now the screen server will be loaded by

3941
02:39:14,160 --> 02:39:16,479
another process called the legacy screen

3942
02:39:16,479 --> 02:39:18,720
saver process

3943
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:21,200
and unfortunately the bad thing with

3944
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:23,359
this is that it's sandboxed

3945
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:24,800
which means

3946
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:26,720
that you are restricted what you can do

3947
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:29,120
and actually this process is so sandbox

3948
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:30,800
that it doesn't really have too many

3949
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:33,120
writes so it's quite locked down so if

3950
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,600
you want to use this as a persistence

3951
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:37,760
uh you need to have some sort of sandbox

3952
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:40,880
escape to know how to

3953
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:44,080
get rid of the sandbox

3954
02:39:44,319 --> 02:39:46,960
detection again new files

3955
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:48,960
where the screen saver should be

3956
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:50,240
placed

3957
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:53,600
files loaded by the legacy screen saver

3958
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:55,280
uh process

3959
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:58,319
or if you just find out that a new saver

3960
02:39:58,319 --> 02:40:01,040
bundle is showing up on the system that

3961
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,120
could be us a nice indication so maybe

3962
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:04,319
the user

3963
02:40:04,319 --> 02:40:07,120
downloaded a new screen saver from some

3964
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:09,200
questionable website

3965
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:11,359
and it will show up in the downloads

3966
02:40:11,359 --> 02:40:12,399
folder

3967
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:15,520
and maybe before the user

3968
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:17,439
puts it in the right location or

3969
02:40:17,439 --> 02:40:18,720
installs it

3970
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:20,960
uh maybe you can take action and

3971
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:24,319
block it right away

3972
02:40:30,319 --> 02:40:33,279
the next one is color pickers

3973
02:40:33,279 --> 02:40:35,200
uh

3974
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:38,399
this was surprising to me because i

3975
02:40:38,399 --> 02:40:39,520
didn't know

3976
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:41,600
that on mac os you can make a custom

3977
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:44,240
color picker so what is a color picker

3978
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:46,640
basically this pane uh you see there

3979
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:50,720
where you can pick a color for your font

3980
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:53,840
for your background or for whatever

3981
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:57,840
these color pickers and turns out

3982
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:00,640
each of these tabs on the top

3983
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:03,200
is a different color picker

3984
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:07,200
and you can implement your own on mac os

3985
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:08,640
uh

3986
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:13,120
this is something really old stuff uh or

3987
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:15,279
not that well known

3988
02:41:15,279 --> 02:41:18,640
uh but i still found a couple of uh

3989
02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:22,240
sample projects on github

3990
02:41:22,240 --> 02:41:24,800
from like eight nine years ago people

3991
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:26,640
are showing okay this is the way you can

3992
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:28,800
implement the color picker

3993
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:33,680
on mac os i i wonder really how many

3994
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:37,439
ancient plugins mac ost supports uh like

3995
02:41:37,439 --> 02:41:38,319
this

3996
02:41:38,319 --> 02:41:40,880
it would be interesting to explore

3997
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:42,479
all of these

3998
02:41:42,479 --> 02:41:44,399
there are some obvious locations called

3999
02:41:44,399 --> 02:41:47,040
the plugins um

4000
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:49,120
but this one is not obvious like the

4001
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:51,120
library color pickers directory doesn't

4002
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:53,120
even exist by default so if you want to

4003
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:55,680
install your color picker uh you have to

4004
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:58,560
create this directory

4005
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:00,640
so it's not obvious to find

4006
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:03,040
all of this but yeah it will be loaded

4007
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:04,479
by the legacy

4008
02:42:04,479 --> 02:42:07,520
external color picker service

4009
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:09,359
process and unfortunately it's also

4010
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:10,720
sandboxed

4011
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:12,479
but i still found it interesting because

4012
02:42:12,479 --> 02:42:14,880
i think it's not a very own

4013
02:42:14,880 --> 02:42:16,000
um

4014
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,399
not just persistence but a feature

4015
02:42:18,399 --> 02:42:20,880
at all on mac os

4016
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:23,520
uh again detection is just the same as

4017
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:27,040
all the others so any new files

4018
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:28,720
in the color pickers

4019
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:30,880
directory

4020
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:34,080
or files loaded by this

4021
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:36,720
legacy external core picker service or

4022
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:40,840
any new color picker bundle

4023
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:42,479
periodic scripts

4024
02:42:42,479 --> 02:42:44,000
uh this is

4025
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,800
probably my second my first top favorite

4026
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:48,960
is the pam modulus really this is the

4027
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:51,200
second because i keep abusing this

4028
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:53,680
feature in exploitation

4029
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:55,600
not for persistence

4030
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:58,000
uh but what it is periodic scripts are

4031
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,399
maintenance scripts uh it's coming from

4032
02:43:00,399 --> 02:43:03,600
freebsd so actually mac os has some free

4033
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:06,160
bsd origin and it inherited

4034
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:08,640
uh all of this stuff

4035
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:09,680
and

4036
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:11,840
there are three types of scripts they

4037
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:15,840
are run either daily weekly or monthly

4038
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:18,880
and all of them have their own

4039
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:22,319
launch demon file

4040
02:43:22,399 --> 02:43:25,279
which you can see the com apple

4041
02:43:25,279 --> 02:43:30,240
periodic daily monthly weekly p list

4042
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:33,200
since it's their launch demon it means

4043
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:35,359
that they will be run as root

4044
02:43:35,359 --> 02:43:38,479
and now what happens here is the

4045
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:40,160
all these launch demons we are called

4046
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:43,120
the periodic wrapper process

4047
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:45,520
which will launch the usr as being

4048
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:47,040
periodic

4049
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:50,520
bash script

4050
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:53,200
the script themselves

4051
02:43:53,200 --> 02:43:55,680
are located under the etc

4052
02:43:55,680 --> 02:43:58,160
periodic directory and there is one for

4053
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:00,000
daily weekly monthly

4054
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:00,800
uh

4055
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:02,960
script there are a bunch of them

4056
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:04,800
and basically what the

4057
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:06,240
periodic burst

4058
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:07,600
script does

4059
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:10,399
is goes enumerates all the scripts goes

4060
02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:12,160
through and executes all of them these

4061
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:14,399
are bashed scripts

4062
02:44:14,399 --> 02:44:15,439
and

4063
02:44:15,439 --> 02:44:18,319
there is also config file for periodic

4064
02:44:18,319 --> 02:44:20,319
the periodic.conf

4065
02:44:20,319 --> 02:44:22,160
and it has

4066
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:24,640
defined the secondary place the user

4067
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:26,399
local etc

4068
02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:27,600
periodic

4069
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:29,920
which where you can place your own

4070
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:32,160
periodic scripts if you want now

4071
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:34,160
actually you can place your own scripts

4072
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:36,240
in the main directory as well it's not

4073
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:38,160
protected or anything

4074
02:44:38,160 --> 02:44:40,560
uh but you can use the the other local

4075
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:42,560
directory now

4076
02:44:42,560 --> 02:44:45,840
the the interesting thing with this uh

4077
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:48,000
was that if you have homebrew

4078
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,680
installed on mac os homeroom is a

4079
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:52,880
package manager for mac os

4080
02:44:52,880 --> 02:44:56,800
homebrew sets the usl local directory to

4081
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:58,080
be owned

4082
02:44:58,080 --> 02:44:59,600
by the

4083
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:03,279
local admin user or the first admin user

4084
02:45:03,279 --> 02:45:05,040
on the mac now typically a mac has a

4085
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:08,000
single admin user and and that's it

4086
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,319
because by default it's owned by root

4087
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:13,279
but it changes it to the

4088
02:45:13,279 --> 02:45:15,120
to the admin user now

4089
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:18,080
on mac os going from admin to root is

4090
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:20,720
considered a second security boundary

4091
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:22,880
versus on windows it's not

4092
02:45:22,880 --> 02:45:25,040
uh because on mac os you actually need

4093
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:28,640
to authenticate to go from admin to root

4094
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:31,840
uh with typing your password or your

4095
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:34,399
fingerprint or something but you have to

4096
02:45:34,399 --> 02:45:36,560
do an authentication

4097
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:38,560
so it's a boundary

4098
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:42,720
but because uh the usr local

4099
02:45:42,720 --> 02:45:46,800
directory was set to be owned by the

4100
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:47,920
user

4101
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:50,000
uh you could to

4102
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,040
create this etc periodic directory place

4103
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:55,279
a script there as a user

4104
02:45:55,279 --> 02:45:57,600
and that script would be executed as

4105
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:00,080
root so it's like a

4106
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:03,680
trivial privilege escalation

4107
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:07,920
and apple fixed this in bixer 11.5 and

4108
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:09,920
what they did

4109
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:12,080
is the diff of the

4110
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:13,680
periodic

4111
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:17,439
scripts they check the owner of the

4112
02:46:17,439 --> 02:46:22,240
maintenance script and they will execute

4113
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:24,479
the script with the owner of the script

4114
02:46:24,479 --> 02:46:27,279
so if if you created the script as an

4115
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:30,800
admin user it will execute the script as

4116
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:34,560
admin user and not as root

4117
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:37,439
so they were nice to close this although

4118
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:39,200
this was

4119
02:46:39,200 --> 02:46:40,319
really not

4120
02:46:40,319 --> 02:46:43,840
a mac os problem this problem

4121
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:46,240
was because you installed homebrew

4122
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:50,000
which changed the default settings

4123
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,640
now but interestingly you can

4124
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:55,040
if you wind so if you do exploitation on

4125
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:58,880
mac os and you find a way to drop

4126
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:01,439
a script somewhere which is owned by the

4127
02:47:01,439 --> 02:47:03,279
user

4128
02:47:03,279 --> 02:47:05,920
i commonly use the periodic script to

4129
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:09,439
drop a file in the periodic location and

4130
02:47:09,439 --> 02:47:11,080
get it executed by the

4131
02:47:11,080 --> 02:47:13,040
[Music]

4132
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:15,359
periodic wrapper

4133
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:17,760
in a day to achieve some privilege

4134
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:20,000
escalation but now it's gone because if

4135
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,880
i drop a file there

4136
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:25,600
as the user it will be executed as the

4137
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:28,080
user and not as root but

4138
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:30,920
if we can still do that so the

4139
02:47:30,920 --> 02:47:33,359
999.local script

4140
02:47:33,359 --> 02:47:35,439
defines more locations

4141
02:47:35,439 --> 02:47:37,920
and what it will do

4142
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:40,399
uh it will execute

4143
02:47:40,399 --> 02:47:42,640
the scripts we can see there like the

4144
02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:45,560
daily local which is the slash atc

4145
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:47,279
daily.local

4146
02:47:47,279 --> 02:47:49,359
and there is one for weekly and monthly

4147
02:47:49,359 --> 02:47:50,399
local

4148
02:47:50,399 --> 02:47:52,640
these files don't exist by default but

4149
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:54,640
if we manage to create them

4150
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:58,160
uh the 999.local which we run as root

4151
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:02,520
will execute these as well

4152
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:05,840
yeah uh detection

4153
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:07,359
uh i think there are a couple of things

4154
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:08,560
here uh

4155
02:48:08,560 --> 02:48:10,800
first of all

4156
02:48:10,800 --> 02:48:12,880
monitor for the change of the periodic

4157
02:48:12,880 --> 02:48:16,880
config file that shouldn't change really

4158
02:48:16,880 --> 02:48:18,479
because someone can define a new

4159
02:48:18,479 --> 02:48:20,560
location for the scripts

4160
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:21,359
uh

4161
02:48:21,359 --> 02:48:23,920
basically monitored for the change of

4162
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:26,560
any of the scripts or any of the folder

4163
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:28,880
containing the scripts

4164
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:31,920
and probably also monitor for some weird

4165
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:35,680
processes started by periodic uh so

4166
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:37,439
normally applications don't install

4167
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:39,760
periodic scripts so you can make a

4168
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:43,279
baseline but it's executed in a

4169
02:48:43,279 --> 02:48:44,560
normally

4170
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:47,120
and then anything that doesn't feel into

4171
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:49,439
that bucket

4172
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:51,760
uh is an outlier and probably a marvel

4173
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:55,359
or red email or or something else

4174
02:48:55,359 --> 02:48:59,560
next one is terminal preferences

4175
02:49:00,720 --> 02:49:02,319
so this is

4176
02:49:02,319 --> 02:49:06,640
terminal for those who don't have a mac

4177
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:10,399
and terminal can define a startup

4178
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:11,920
command

4179
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:13,920
under the profile

4180
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:16,640
and basically this is what we see here

4181
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:17,920
at the

4182
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:19,439
bottom

4183
02:49:19,439 --> 02:49:21,680
uh you can define a command which is a

4184
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:22,560
bash

4185
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:24,080
or a share command

4186
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:26,720
and that will be executed when terminal

4187
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:29,120
is launched or first started

4188
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:30,880
this configuration is stored in

4189
02:49:30,880 --> 02:49:34,160
terminals preferences file

4190
02:49:34,160 --> 02:49:36,880
which is in the library preferences

4191
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:38,880
directory

4192
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:40,640
it's a plist

4193
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:43,200
plist is a property list on mac os

4194
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:44,560
basically it's

4195
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:46,560
a configuration file

4196
02:49:46,560 --> 02:49:48,800
it can be either displayed

4197
02:49:48,800 --> 02:49:49,600
or

4198
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:52,080
stored as a binary format or in xml

4199
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:54,240
format

4200
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:56,479
i believe nowadays they try to default

4201
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:59,200
to binary format but you can still print

4202
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:01,680
it as an xml or

4203
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:05,359
overwrite it as an xml and it will work

4204
02:50:05,359 --> 02:50:07,680
and basically your command will be

4205
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:09,200
stored under the

4206
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:11,680
windows settings basic and command

4207
02:50:11,680 --> 02:50:12,640
string

4208
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:14,560
so you can just inject this into the

4209
02:50:14,560 --> 02:50:15,840
plist

4210
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:18,399
without touching terminal at all and

4211
02:50:18,399 --> 02:50:21,359
next time terminal is launched

4212
02:50:21,359 --> 02:50:23,680
you get your code executed

4213
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:25,760
uh detection just check for the

4214
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:28,720
modification of this file now if

4215
02:50:28,720 --> 02:50:31,120
if someone changes the preferences in

4216
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:33,680
terminal like they

4217
02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:36,640
enlarge the font or change the colors or

4218
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:39,359
whatever these five will be change

4219
02:50:39,359 --> 02:50:41,680
and

4220
02:50:42,319 --> 02:50:44,160
so you might get plenty of force

4221
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:45,920
positive now

4222
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:48,240
the other thing is that preferences

4223
02:50:48,240 --> 02:50:50,240
is not changed by the terminal process

4224
02:50:50,240 --> 02:50:51,520
itself

4225
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:52,319
but

4226
02:50:52,319 --> 02:50:54,800
there is a daemon on macos called the cf

4227
02:50:54,800 --> 02:50:57,200
previously

4228
02:50:57,200 --> 02:50:59,359
which runs as the user and there is

4229
02:50:59,359 --> 02:51:01,680
another instance that runs as root

4230
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:03,439
and whenever you want to change a

4231
02:51:03,439 --> 02:51:06,000
preference you call the preference api

4232
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,080
and that api will call out to the

4233
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:10,080
preference daemon and the preference

4234
02:51:10,080 --> 02:51:12,240
daemon will be the one that

4235
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:15,120
saves or loads the settings

4236
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:16,880
so basically

4237
02:51:16,880 --> 02:51:19,359
this preference file is always modified

4238
02:51:19,359 --> 02:51:21,600
by the preference daemon

4239
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,279
normally

4240
02:51:23,279 --> 02:51:25,920
but if maybe another process directly

4241
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:27,760
touches this file

4242
02:51:27,760 --> 02:51:28,560
that's

4243
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:30,640
that's not good

4244
02:51:30,640 --> 02:51:33,200
for sure

4245
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:34,479
although

4246
02:51:34,479 --> 02:51:36,640
your custom binary can also call the

4247
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:38,800
preferences api

4248
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:39,840
and

4249
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:42,000
modify it through the preferences daemon

4250
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:45,439
so there are ways around it

4251
02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:47,840
but yeah

4252
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,120
uh

4253
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:50,720
the ninth one

4254
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:54,080
it's the e1d the event monitor demon

4255
02:51:54,080 --> 02:51:55,520
it's also some

4256
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:58,240
very old

4257
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:01,040
process or daemon

4258
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:03,359
for mac os there have been two previous

4259
02:52:03,359 --> 02:52:06,960
work uh on this one by james reynold and

4260
02:52:06,960 --> 02:52:08,319
chris cross

4261
02:52:08,319 --> 02:52:11,439
uh both of them wrote a very detailed

4262
02:52:11,439 --> 02:52:15,520
blog post how this daemon works

4263
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:19,230
what it can do etc it's quite complex

4264
02:52:19,230 --> 02:52:21,520
[Music]

4265
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:24,399
to set it up

4266
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:26,560
and i don't think that anyone really

4267
02:52:26,560 --> 02:52:30,560
uses this nowadays but it's still there

4268
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:32,640
so first of all this service is not

4269
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:33,920
started

4270
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:36,240
uh by default on the system

4271
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:38,960
to start it you have to place a file in

4272
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:43,120
the private var db emand clients folder

4273
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:44,800
any file just

4274
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:46,880
dropify to a touch

4275
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:49,200
and once something is there the process

4276
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:50,800
will start up

4277
02:52:50,800 --> 02:52:52,800
so this is the first step

4278
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:54,840
then there are rules

4279
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:57,600
um for this daemon

4280
02:52:57,600 --> 02:53:01,760
in the etc e1d slash shoes

4281
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:03,439
directory

4282
02:53:03,439 --> 02:53:06,160
and it also has a config file

4283
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:09,120
which contains the additional rules pass

4284
02:53:09,120 --> 02:53:10,640
so it defines

4285
02:53:10,640 --> 02:53:12,479
a location where you can also set up

4286
02:53:12,479 --> 02:53:14,880
rules

4287
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:19,120
so here is a simple rule

4288
02:53:19,600 --> 02:53:21,760
basically the rules define

4289
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:24,160
what this demon should do and on what

4290
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:26,640
event

4291
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:29,120
should react or or

4292
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:31,200
do anything basically

4293
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:33,120
so here's a simple rule

4294
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:33,920
uh

4295
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:34,800
it

4296
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:37,520
monitors or it's

4297
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:39,840
for the event type startup so whenever

4298
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:41,840
the daemon starts up

4299
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:44,720
uh this rule will be triggered

4300
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:47,680
then we define the action

4301
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:51,359
and under the action we define command

4302
02:53:51,359 --> 02:53:53,200
which would be bash

4303
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:56,240
in this case then we define the user

4304
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:58,800
we want this command to be run under we

4305
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:00,319
set it to root

4306
02:54:00,319 --> 02:54:02,160
and then we set the arguments for the

4307
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:03,200
command

4308
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:05,920
and basically here we just run a simple

4309
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:08,000
bash script

4310
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,160
and then there is also the type which is

4311
02:54:10,160 --> 02:54:13,359
run command so this is the way this is a

4312
02:54:13,359 --> 02:54:15,920
rule file or the way you can execute the

4313
02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:18,720
best script with the email

4314
02:54:18,720 --> 02:54:21,840
d process

4315
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,359
so detection

4316
02:54:25,359 --> 02:54:28,319
uh first of all any new

4317
02:54:28,319 --> 02:54:30,800
if emond is usually not used in your

4318
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:33,520
environment any new file in the email

4319
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:35,840
clients directory is a huge alert

4320
02:54:35,840 --> 02:54:37,600
because there shouldn't be really

4321
02:54:37,600 --> 02:54:39,200
anything

4322
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:43,200
then any new or modified files in the

4323
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:45,120
roots directory

4324
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:47,120
change of the e-mount plist

4325
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:49,600
configuration file and any child

4326
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:51,840
processes of emond

4327
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:54,880
i think any of these can be

4328
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:56,960
a huge red flag

4329
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:59,438
normally

4330
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:04,000
and yeah

4331
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:05,760
so the last one

4332
02:55:05,760 --> 02:55:08,720
is called folder actions

4333
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:11,279
uh it was first detailed by cody thomas

4334
02:55:11,279 --> 02:55:14,399
uh in his blog post

4335
02:55:14,399 --> 02:55:15,520
and

4336
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:18,240
if other actions are

4337
02:55:18,240 --> 02:55:20,880
scripts dot run

4338
02:55:20,880 --> 02:55:21,920
then

4339
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:25,279
files are modified or added or deleted

4340
02:55:25,279 --> 02:55:27,760
from a certain folder further we can

4341
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:31,200
define four directions in finder

4342
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:32,560
and

4343
02:55:32,560 --> 02:55:34,479
all these scripts are located in the

4344
02:55:34,479 --> 02:55:37,520
library scripts for direction scripts

4345
02:55:37,520 --> 02:55:38,800
location

4346
02:55:38,800 --> 02:55:40,479
now it's not that simple that we just

4347
02:55:40,479 --> 02:55:42,240
place our script there and the tearbag

4348
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:43,680
executed

4349
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:45,600
there is a configuration

4350
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:47,760
goes with that in the

4351
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:50,479
four direction dispatcher p list

4352
02:55:50,479 --> 02:55:52,479
where we need to define

4353
02:55:52,479 --> 02:55:55,200
the the folders we want to monitor

4354
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:56,640
and

4355
02:55:56,640 --> 02:55:58,880
the actions we want to take like which

4356
02:55:58,880 --> 02:56:01,040
script to execute

4357
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:03,439
now this is a very ugly p list

4358
02:56:03,439 --> 02:56:06,160
because it has a very weird

4359
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:08,000
setup format

4360
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,399
and then it contains an embedded plist

4361
02:56:10,399 --> 02:56:13,279
in base64 format and that

4362
02:56:13,279 --> 02:56:16,080
embed.plist contains another embedded

4363
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:17,120
plist

4364
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:19,279
which will actually contain the the

4365
02:56:19,279 --> 02:56:21,439
final settings and the entire

4366
02:56:21,439 --> 02:56:23,680
configuration is weird

4367
02:56:23,680 --> 02:56:25,680
with some beard names

4368
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,760
and i didn't start to reverse it okay

4369
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:30,399
how you do it

4370
02:56:30,399 --> 02:56:33,040
what you can do

4371
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:35,359
is

4372
02:56:35,439 --> 02:56:37,200
create a new folder action through the

4373
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:39,200
gui

4374
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:41,200
save it and

4375
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:43,600
it will create the p list for you

4376
02:56:43,600 --> 02:56:45,359
now just you can just

4377
02:56:45,359 --> 02:56:48,160
take this please from your computer

4378
02:56:48,160 --> 02:56:50,800
and drop it on on any other mac

4379
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:53,359
and that will work

4380
02:56:53,359 --> 02:56:54,560
so

4381
02:56:54,560 --> 02:56:56,399
how we can

4382
02:56:56,399 --> 02:56:58,880
set this up without any user interaction

4383
02:56:58,880 --> 02:57:00,240
because that's

4384
02:57:00,240 --> 02:57:02,240
not straightforward

4385
02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:03,840
uh so first of all we create the

4386
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:05,439
directory for the scripts because it

4387
02:57:05,439 --> 02:57:07,840
doesn't exist by default we copy our

4388
02:57:07,840 --> 02:57:10,800
script to this location

4389
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:11,840
and then

4390
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:15,040
let's say we defined the test directory

4391
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:17,600
which we want to monitor or take action

4392
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:19,600
on

4393
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:21,680
and save the settings for that so we

4394
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:24,479
create the test directory and then we

4395
02:57:24,479 --> 02:57:27,359
copy our prepared configuration file

4396
02:57:27,359 --> 02:57:29,920
into the preferences directory

4397
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:32,960
we are still not done because it will

4398
02:57:32,960 --> 02:57:34,319
not go into

4399
02:57:34,319 --> 02:57:37,279
effect right away what we need to do is

4400
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:39,680
open the four directions setup

4401
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:41,760
application

4402
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:44,319
and then we can kill it as well but

4403
02:57:44,319 --> 02:57:45,920
basically whenever the full direction

4404
02:57:45,920 --> 02:57:48,000
setup is executed

4405
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:48,840
it

4406
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:52,240
will make the whole thing live

4407
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:54,479
uh from that point on and then if we

4408
02:57:54,479 --> 02:57:56,319
reboot uh

4409
02:57:56,319 --> 02:57:58,720
the computer it will stay active

4410
02:57:58,720 --> 02:58:01,120
but for the very first time we need to

4411
02:58:01,120 --> 02:58:02,840
do this

4412
02:58:02,840 --> 02:58:04,560
now

4413
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:06,720
what's interesting is

4414
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:09,680
the script that we dropped there will be

4415
02:58:09,680 --> 02:58:12,479
executed by the folder action dispatcher

4416
02:58:12,479 --> 02:58:13,920
process

4417
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:16,880
and if we want to access any privacy

4418
02:58:16,880 --> 02:58:18,800
related location

4419
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:20,800
uh obviously it doesn't have the right

4420
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:23,600
but it will prompt the user for that

4421
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:26,960
and what the user will see in this case

4422
02:58:26,960 --> 02:58:28,880
that the folder action dispatcher

4423
02:58:28,880 --> 02:58:30,080
process

4424
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:32,800
would like to access something

4425
02:58:32,800 --> 02:58:35,279
so it's not your script

4426
02:58:35,279 --> 02:58:36,319
or

4427
02:58:36,319 --> 02:58:37,920
whatever file

4428
02:58:37,920 --> 02:58:40,800
that the user will see that that file or

4429
02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:42,000
that

4430
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,319
scripts want to access something

4431
02:58:44,319 --> 02:58:46,960
but it's the default for the action

4432
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:48,960
dispatcher

4433
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:52,240
uh process now first i doubt that

4434
02:58:52,240 --> 02:58:54,240
most people will

4435
02:58:54,240 --> 02:58:57,600
know that this exists or know what it is

4436
02:58:57,600 --> 02:59:01,200
but it can be still misleading

4437
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:03,439
because what they see okay this is

4438
02:59:03,439 --> 02:59:05,200
like

4439
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:07,600
a legit

4440
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:08,880
process

4441
02:59:08,880 --> 02:59:09,840
comes

4442
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:12,479
by default with the system so it might

4443
02:59:12,479 --> 02:59:14,800
be right

4444
02:59:14,800 --> 02:59:16,319
it's not harmful

4445
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:20,080
it's installed by default on the system

4446
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:22,720
detection so there are

4447
02:59:22,720 --> 02:59:25,760
few steps this first any new file

4448
02:59:25,760 --> 02:59:29,040
scripts in the four direction scripts

4449
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:30,240
folder

4450
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:32,080
then the change of the

4451
02:59:32,080 --> 02:59:34,560
configuration file

4452
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:36,160
and then

4453
02:59:36,160 --> 02:59:38,080
the process which is responsible for

4454
02:59:38,080 --> 02:59:40,399
launching the scripts is the com apple

4455
02:59:40,399 --> 02:59:42,000
foundation user

4456
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,160
script service process

4457
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:46,479
so you can also monitor for this process

4458
02:59:46,479 --> 02:59:49,359
launching any other processes or scripts

4459
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:51,120
or or whatever

4460
02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:54,640
so there are a few options here

4461
02:59:55,200 --> 02:59:57,359
uh conclusion

4462
02:59:57,359 --> 03:00:00,080
so marvel actually still uses

4463
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:03,120
a launch dp list

4464
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:06,560
probably that's because it works

4465
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:08,560
unfortunately some of these persistent

4466
03:00:08,560 --> 03:00:11,120
techniques while interesting

4467
03:00:11,120 --> 03:00:14,160
some of them requires you to have root

4468
03:00:14,160 --> 03:00:17,120
some of them sandbox so not all of them

4469
03:00:17,120 --> 03:00:19,439
are perfect some of them are application

4470
03:00:19,439 --> 03:00:20,960
specific

4471
03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:23,680
so they are not perfect but

4472
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:26,000
they might work some of them relies on

4473
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,240
the user executing an application like

4474
03:00:28,240 --> 03:00:31,760
terminal or hyperspoon

4475
03:00:32,880 --> 03:00:35,359
some of them will work

4476
03:00:35,359 --> 03:00:36,840
just nicely

4477
03:00:36,840 --> 03:00:39,840
um but i think there are many unexplored

4478
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:41,279
options

4479
03:00:41,279 --> 03:00:43,840
and and i think we need to prepare for

4480
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:46,000
this as uh

4481
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:50,240
defenders and if we are retimers

4482
03:00:50,240 --> 03:00:54,000
uh we can just add all of these to our

4483
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,240
arsenal and

4484
03:00:56,240 --> 03:00:57,920
and try to use them

4485
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:01,279
and i have many others on my uh blog

4486
03:01:01,279 --> 03:01:02,399
post like

4487
03:01:02,399 --> 03:01:05,120
right now i think 29

4488
03:01:05,120 --> 03:01:08,479
and before i go to the questions

4489
03:01:08,479 --> 03:01:10,800
i want to recommend the tool which is

4490
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:13,200
written by patrick ford

4491
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:15,279
it's called blog block

4492
03:01:15,279 --> 03:01:17,760
so if you have a mac i think

4493
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:20,080
this is like a must-have tool this is

4494
03:01:20,080 --> 03:01:21,920
free

4495
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:24,080
what it does it monitors for many

4496
03:01:24,080 --> 03:01:28,080
locations which contains

4497
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:30,319
through which you can persist

4498
03:01:30,319 --> 03:01:32,960
and the launch agent is one of the

4499
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:34,880
examples

4500
03:01:34,880 --> 03:01:37,279
and it will alert you so let me just

4501
03:01:37,279 --> 03:01:38,479
show this

4502
03:01:38,479 --> 03:01:41,120
let me just create a file

4503
03:01:41,120 --> 03:01:43,439
in

4504
03:01:45,600 --> 03:01:48,600
here

4505
03:01:52,640 --> 03:01:55,120
and i got an alert that hey

4506
03:01:55,120 --> 03:01:57,359
the touch application

4507
03:01:57,359 --> 03:02:00,160
is install the new launch agent

4508
03:02:00,160 --> 03:02:02,479
do you want to allow it or not

4509
03:02:02,479 --> 03:02:02,930
um

4510
03:02:02,930 --> 03:02:04,240
[Music]

4511
03:02:04,240 --> 03:02:06,319
and i think this is pretty cool and

4512
03:02:06,319 --> 03:02:08,560
launch agents is not the only directory

4513
03:02:08,560 --> 03:02:10,399
this will be a monitor

4514
03:02:10,399 --> 03:02:11,680
um

4515
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:14,240
so i think if you have a mac uh have

4516
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:16,479
this tool especially that most mothers

4517
03:02:16,479 --> 03:02:17,760
they use

4518
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:19,520
launch agents uh

4519
03:02:19,520 --> 03:02:22,160
basically these two can block

4520
03:02:22,160 --> 03:02:25,680
almost all of marvel nowadays on mac so

4521
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:29,040
yeah it's pretty cool easy so yeah use

4522
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:31,840
it

4523
03:02:34,319 --> 03:02:36,960
any questions

4524
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:40,919
anyone yeah go

4525
03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:53,439
uh it depends um

4526
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:56,240
so the question was uh if sandbox pro

4527
03:02:56,240 --> 03:02:58,240
okay sandbox processes cannot touch the

4528
03:02:58,240 --> 03:03:00,399
system but can they open like network

4529
03:03:00,399 --> 03:03:03,600
connections and so on uh i don't

4530
03:03:03,600 --> 03:03:04,640
remember

4531
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:06,000
it's um

4532
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:07,840
the way it's defined

4533
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:10,240
uh the process the sandbox process

4534
03:03:10,240 --> 03:03:12,080
should have an entitlement for like

4535
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:14,240
hello network connection

4536
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:16,960
uh hello i don't know access this

4537
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:20,000
resource this resource and i don't

4538
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,080
remember if these

4539
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:23,120
uh

4540
03:03:23,120 --> 03:03:26,319
processes has that so it might be able

4541
03:03:26,319 --> 03:03:27,439
to

4542
03:03:27,439 --> 03:03:30,399
uh open a network connection or it might

4543
03:03:30,399 --> 03:03:32,080
not i'm not

4544
03:03:32,080 --> 03:03:36,240
100 sure actually if you want we can

4545
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:39,520
uh it takes just a second

4546
03:03:39,520 --> 03:03:42,240
to see that

4547
03:03:47,200 --> 03:03:49,760
i have the

4548
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:54,840
process here so

4549
03:03:56,720 --> 03:03:58,880
so let's see what it can do so this is

4550
03:03:58,880 --> 03:04:00,640
app sandboxed

4551
03:04:00,640 --> 03:04:02,720
what it can do so it's a network client

4552
03:04:02,720 --> 03:04:04,960
so it can open network connection

4553
03:04:04,960 --> 03:04:07,960
um

4554
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,960
and it can access like bookmarks

4555
03:04:10,960 --> 03:04:12,319
um

4556
03:04:12,319 --> 03:04:15,200
user selected files and a few other

4557
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:16,160
stuff

4558
03:04:16,160 --> 03:04:18,560
it's limited but yeah it can do a few

4559
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:21,560
items

4560
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:24,479
any other questions

4561
03:04:24,479 --> 03:04:26,960
come on don't be shy

4562
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:29,760
yeah i'm also from hungary so be awesome

4563
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:34,040
go ahead sir don't like

4564
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:42,960
no so i don't do

4565
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:45,600
um so we should repeat the question

4566
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:49,120
maybe so what's my experience with

4567
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:51,840
people clicking ok or

4568
03:04:51,840 --> 03:04:53,439
just move on with these all these

4569
03:04:53,439 --> 03:04:54,880
prompts

4570
03:04:54,880 --> 03:04:58,720
i don't do red teaming for my quest

4571
03:04:58,720 --> 03:05:01,760
in in any environment so i just do all

4572
03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:04,640
of my research in my own

4573
03:05:04,640 --> 03:05:06,720
pc but my

4574
03:05:06,720 --> 03:05:07,760
guess

4575
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:10,640
is that problem mac os

4576
03:05:10,640 --> 03:05:12,800
people click hello like

4577
03:05:12,800 --> 03:05:14,479
all these

4578
03:05:14,479 --> 03:05:16,840
so all this stuff we see

4579
03:05:16,840 --> 03:05:20,399
here so this these are settings for all

4580
03:05:20,399 --> 03:05:22,720
sorts of privacy stuff

4581
03:05:22,720 --> 03:05:23,520
like

4582
03:05:23,520 --> 03:05:25,920
it's a list of i don't know like 20

4583
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:27,680
items

4584
03:05:27,680 --> 03:05:29,840
and

4585
03:05:29,840 --> 03:05:33,359
each application has to prompt for each

4586
03:05:33,359 --> 03:05:34,880
item

4587
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:35,680
now

4588
03:05:35,680 --> 03:05:37,840
probably over time it's less prones but

4589
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:40,880
when you initially start to use a device

4590
03:05:40,880 --> 03:05:43,439
you get a whole lot of prompts and and i

4591
03:05:43,439 --> 03:05:44,399
think

4592
03:05:44,399 --> 03:05:46,640
users will be just tired of this and

4593
03:05:46,640 --> 03:05:49,840
yeah hello hello hello hello and yeah

4594
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:53,120
they they want to go on so my guess and

4595
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:56,399
this is my personal opinion is that

4596
03:05:56,399 --> 03:05:59,120
people might actually click yeah okay

4597
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:01,840
hello

4598
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:05,039
any other questions

4599
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:07,920
no

4600
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:10,000
are you guys sure

4601
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:13,040
hm okay then i guess a rounder applause

4602
03:06:13,040 --> 03:06:14,000
for

4603
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:17,279
excellent talk thank you

4604
03:06:20,720 --> 03:06:24,960
and now we have a really amusing part of

4605
03:06:24,960 --> 03:06:26,560
this conference

4606
03:06:26,560 --> 03:06:29,200
it's called human tetris

4607
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:30,880
it's going to be epic

4608
03:06:30,880 --> 03:06:33,040
there's a lot of people here

4609
03:06:33,040 --> 03:06:35,120
and let's see how badly we can mess this

4610
03:06:35,120 --> 03:06:36,720
up

4611
03:06:36,720 --> 03:06:39,040
we're going to eat now hopefully

4612
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:40,880
if no one dies in the process of getting

4613
03:06:40,880 --> 03:06:43,760
to the food and this will we have sort

4614
03:06:43,760 --> 03:06:46,160
of set up a fair

4615
03:06:46,160 --> 03:06:48,880
rules here a bit of a rule

4616
03:06:48,880 --> 03:06:52,160
how to charge the buffet of food

4617
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:53,439
so

4618
03:06:53,439 --> 03:06:56,399
i would like to ask everyone here to be

4619
03:06:56,399 --> 03:06:58,000
an adult right now

4620
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,399
and don't use the viking word

4621
03:07:00,399 --> 03:07:02,720
charge and just go

4622
03:07:02,720 --> 03:07:04,080
but this is how it's going to happen in

4623
03:07:04,080 --> 03:07:06,240
my mind when it goes pixel perfect and i

4624
03:07:06,240 --> 03:07:07,760
know that that's not going to happen but

4625
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:09,359
we could try

4626
03:07:09,359 --> 03:07:11,760
so everyone in this room and the other

4627
03:07:11,760 --> 03:07:14,760
people's

4628
04:26:59,090 --> 04:27:03,490

very much for coming i hope you're not

4636
04:29:48,960 --> 04:29:52,080
too sleepy after uh lunch but hopefully

4637
04:29:52,080 --> 04:29:53,600
uh i'll try to make it entertaining

4638
04:29:53,600 --> 04:29:55,120
enough so

4639
04:29:55,120 --> 04:29:55,920
uh

4640
04:29:55,920 --> 04:29:58,560
this uh slightly if you feel like this

4641
04:29:58,560 --> 04:30:00,319
workshop is a little bit because this is

4642
04:30:00,319 --> 04:30:02,080
like a talk slash workshop so it's very

4643
04:30:02,080 --> 04:30:03,680
practical as you will see

4644
04:30:03,680 --> 04:30:05,040
if you feel like this is a little bit

4645
04:30:05,040 --> 04:30:07,199
rushed there's also like a one hour and

4646
04:30:07,199 --> 04:30:09,520
a half recording that a little bit more

4647
04:30:09,520 --> 04:30:10,880
calm down

4648
04:30:10,880 --> 04:30:13,840
explanation of this and yeah all the the

4649
04:30:13,840 --> 04:30:15,920
slides the all the vulnerable apps that

4650
04:30:15,920 --> 04:30:17,920
i'm going to demonstrate and everything

4651
04:30:17,920 --> 04:30:19,840
else this is all available for free

4652
04:30:19,840 --> 04:30:21,600
there's just serious security comes last

4653
04:30:21,600 --> 04:30:22,720
three so

4654
04:30:22,720 --> 04:30:24,479
you can get it there if anybody's

4655
04:30:24,479 --> 04:30:26,560
interested in you can try this exercise

4656
04:30:26,560 --> 04:30:29,680
on your own and all that stuff so okay

4657
04:30:29,680 --> 04:30:32,239
so today we're going to see how

4658
04:30:32,239 --> 04:30:34,319
to hack javascript desktop applications

4659
04:30:34,319 --> 04:30:36,880
with xss and remote code execution

4660
04:30:36,880 --> 04:30:38,640
so i'll give you like a quick

4661
04:30:38,640 --> 04:30:40,399
introduction so if you have

4662
04:30:40,399 --> 04:30:42,399
no idea about this like how you can get

4663
04:30:42,399 --> 04:30:43,520
started

4664
04:30:43,520 --> 04:30:44,880
and so on and then we will see some

4665
04:30:44,880 --> 04:30:46,399
interesting scenarios about attacking

4666
04:30:46,399 --> 04:30:48,720
electron right so what xss means in the

4667
04:30:48,720 --> 04:30:51,040
context of a desktop application how to

4668
04:30:51,040 --> 04:30:53,359
turn xss into remote code execution

4669
04:30:53,359 --> 04:30:54,880
attacking preload scripts and then a

4670
04:30:54,880 --> 04:30:57,040
very interesting scenario about

4671
04:30:57,040 --> 04:30:59,040
getting code execution through

4672
04:30:59,040 --> 04:31:00,720
exploiting some inter-process

4673
04:31:00,720 --> 04:31:03,359
communication right so uh i'm abraham

4674
04:31:03,359 --> 04:31:04,720
marangooring i'm the ceo of sony

4675
04:31:04,720 --> 04:31:06,720
security we do pants with the training

4676
04:31:06,720 --> 04:31:08,239
we've delivered training at black hat

4677
04:31:08,239 --> 04:31:10,720
hacking the box and many other places

4678
04:31:10,720 --> 04:31:14,399
i do stuff with cure53 i was involved

4679
04:31:14,399 --> 04:31:16,319
with version one as well

4680
04:31:16,319 --> 04:31:18,399
and then i wrote a course for illinois

4681
04:31:18,399 --> 04:31:20,720
security a while back called practical

4682
04:31:20,720 --> 04:31:22,960
web defense i'm the founder and one of

4683
04:31:22,960 --> 04:31:25,359
the project leaders of os odf so this is

4684
04:31:25,359 --> 04:31:27,520
a completely free and open source uh os

4685
04:31:27,520 --> 04:31:30,239
flagship project so if you type awtf.org

4686
04:31:30,239 --> 04:31:32,000
in your browser takes you to the os page

4687
04:31:32,000 --> 04:31:33,680
we have two students for the google

4688
04:31:33,680 --> 04:31:35,120
summer of code this

4689
04:31:35,120 --> 04:31:37,680
summer so hopefully it will be better

4690
04:31:37,680 --> 04:31:39,600
afterwards

4691
04:31:39,600 --> 04:31:41,600
uh yeah that's my slideshare i was a

4692
04:31:41,600 --> 04:31:43,760
developer first then i switched to

4693
04:31:43,760 --> 04:31:45,439
security so

4694
04:31:45,439 --> 04:31:47,040
if you are a developer your pentester i

4695
04:31:47,040 --> 04:31:48,880
got your back i know the frustration of

4696
04:31:48,880 --> 04:31:51,120
on both sides right so

4697
04:31:51,120 --> 04:31:55,120
uh yeah so this uh this is some pentax

4698
04:31:55,120 --> 04:31:56,640
reports where

4699
04:31:56,640 --> 04:31:58,640
we did some work on so smart sharif it

4700
04:31:58,640 --> 04:32:00,000
was an application mandated in the

4701
04:32:00,000 --> 04:32:01,520
entire country of south korea so there's

4702
04:32:01,520 --> 04:32:03,600
two free public pentos reports that you

4703
04:32:03,600 --> 04:32:05,760
can download about it so by law every

4704
04:32:05,760 --> 04:32:07,279
parent and child was forced to install

4705
04:32:07,279 --> 04:32:08,880
this app and the idea was to help

4706
04:32:08,880 --> 04:32:10,399
parents be parents so the parent would

4707
04:32:10,399 --> 04:32:11,359
control

4708
04:32:11,359 --> 04:32:12,800
during what times of the day the child

4709
04:32:12,800 --> 04:32:14,479
can use the phone what websites they can

4710
04:32:14,479 --> 04:32:16,000
visit what applications they can have

4711
04:32:16,000 --> 04:32:19,279
installed stuff like that in theory

4712
04:32:19,279 --> 04:32:21,920
a nice idea to keep the children safe in

4713
04:32:21,920 --> 04:32:23,760
practice horrible security

4714
04:32:23,760 --> 04:32:25,680
implementation so it was so bad that we

4715
04:32:25,680 --> 04:32:27,040
even gave a talk about it right so if

4716
04:32:27,040 --> 04:32:28,640
you search on youtube for

4717
04:32:28,640 --> 04:32:30,560
smart sharif dumb idea

4718
04:32:30,560 --> 04:32:32,880
right you can see a talk about it and

4719
04:32:32,880 --> 04:32:34,560
that's those are the slides as well and

4720
04:32:34,560 --> 04:32:36,159
then all the stuff we did was with the

4721
04:32:36,159 --> 04:32:37,760
chinese

4722
04:32:37,760 --> 04:32:40,560
police chinese government apps so bxaq

4723
04:32:40,560 --> 04:32:42,479
is an application that the chinese

4724
04:32:42,479 --> 04:32:43,920
police installing your phone when you

4725
04:32:43,920 --> 04:32:45,359
cross the border so it grabs your

4726
04:32:45,359 --> 04:32:47,680
contacts your sms messages

4727
04:32:47,680 --> 04:32:49,199
what applications you have installed and

4728
04:32:49,199 --> 04:32:50,720
stuff like that and then uploads

4729
04:32:50,720 --> 04:32:53,120
everything to a police control server

4730
04:32:53,120 --> 04:32:55,040
ijob is more for the police officer to

4731
04:32:55,040 --> 04:32:56,800
try to enter like some information

4732
04:32:56,800 --> 04:33:01,199
manually like blood type height

4733
04:33:01,199 --> 04:33:02,880
power consumption and other stuff like

4734
04:33:02,880 --> 04:33:04,719
that and then study the great nation is

4735
04:33:04,719 --> 04:33:06,561
an interesting concept where

4736
04:33:06,561 --> 04:33:09,438
the application is not mandated in the

4737
04:33:09,438 --> 04:33:11,438
in the entire country as smart share it

4738
04:33:11,438 --> 04:33:12,799
was in korea

4739
04:33:12,799 --> 04:33:14,719
but it is encouraged in china so the

4740
04:33:14,719 --> 04:33:16,080
more you know about the great leader of

4741
04:33:16,080 --> 04:33:17,680
china the more points you get and then

4742
04:33:17,680 --> 04:33:19,199
with these points you can do some cool

4743
04:33:19,199 --> 04:33:21,680
stuff right so i gave a talk about this

4744
04:33:21,680 --> 04:33:24,719
at secti so maybe some of you swedish

4745
04:33:24,719 --> 04:33:26,160
people

4746
04:33:26,160 --> 04:33:28,799
were there or watched it so this that

4747
04:33:28,799 --> 04:33:30,639
was chinese police and cloud pets so you

4748
04:33:30,639 --> 04:33:32,879
can see uh a recording there and there's

4749
04:33:32,879 --> 04:33:35,039
a bunch of other uh public pen test

4750
04:33:35,039 --> 04:33:37,039
reports right so this is all

4751
04:33:37,039 --> 04:33:38,561
a quick way you know to learn about

4752
04:33:38,561 --> 04:33:40,080
security for free just reading the

4753
04:33:40,080 --> 04:33:42,480
public ventures reports of uh various

4754
04:33:42,480 --> 04:33:43,680
companies right

4755
04:33:43,680 --> 04:33:44,879
now uh

4756
04:33:44,879 --> 04:33:46,320
the

4757
04:33:46,320 --> 04:33:47,680
the electron course we have on by

4758
04:33:47,680 --> 04:33:49,520
extension this workshop and talk was

4759
04:33:49,520 --> 04:33:51,680
made more cool thanks to these three

4760
04:33:51,680 --> 04:33:55,199
people so shouts out uh to them so

4761
04:33:55,199 --> 04:33:58,160
masato if you you have to follow him on

4762
04:33:58,160 --> 04:34:01,520
twitter uh if you search on youtube for

4763
04:34:01,520 --> 04:34:05,359
masato versus microsoft teams he got in

4764
04:34:05,359 --> 04:34:08,480
at cancer west i think 150 000 for a

4765
04:34:08,480 --> 04:34:11,039
remote code execution

4766
04:34:11,039 --> 04:34:13,278
file descriptor uh i'm not sure if he

4767
04:34:13,278 --> 04:34:14,799
still is but he has been for many years

4768
04:34:14,799 --> 04:34:16,320
the number one

4769
04:34:16,320 --> 04:34:18,561
uh back bounty hunter for twitter and

4770
04:34:18,561 --> 04:34:19,919
then insert script has done a lot of

4771
04:34:19,919 --> 04:34:22,320
cool uh pdf research and stuff so they

4772
04:34:22,320 --> 04:34:23,039
all

4773
04:34:23,039 --> 04:34:27,599
helped uh make this presentation cooler

4774
04:34:27,599 --> 04:34:29,520
this would be if you want to take the

4775
04:34:29,520 --> 04:34:31,278
course but so i'll just skip through

4776
04:34:31,278 --> 04:34:32,080
this

4777
04:34:32,080 --> 04:34:32,958
uh

4778
04:34:32,958 --> 04:34:35,680
yeah and this and now

4779
04:34:35,680 --> 04:34:36,480
this

4780
04:34:36,480 --> 04:34:38,799
sometimes we use these slides like to

4781
04:34:38,799 --> 04:34:40,000
introduce the course and stuff so i'll

4782
04:34:40,000 --> 04:34:41,278
just talk about what we're going to be

4783
04:34:41,278 --> 04:34:42,639
talking about today right so today we

4784
04:34:42,639 --> 04:34:44,958
are going to see a bit of the

4785
04:34:44,958 --> 04:34:46,879
web preferences right so how to set the

4786
04:34:46,879 --> 04:34:48,240
security settings in the electron

4787
04:34:48,240 --> 04:34:50,480
application they package the json we

4788
04:34:50,480 --> 04:34:53,118
will see a bit of electron xss

4789
04:34:53,118 --> 04:34:56,000
exploitation how to exploit when node

4790
04:34:56,000 --> 04:34:57,520
integration is enabled and then some

4791
04:34:57,520 --> 04:35:00,000
mitigation essentials also show

4792
04:35:00,000 --> 04:35:01,759
electronegativity

4793
04:35:01,759 --> 04:35:04,080
uh from here we will be attacking

4794
04:35:04,080 --> 04:35:06,561
preload scripts

4795
04:35:06,561 --> 04:35:09,039
then electron applications since they

4796
04:35:09,039 --> 04:35:10,799
work on the desktop they can also have

4797
04:35:10,799 --> 04:35:12,958
like local leaks and stuff so there's

4798
04:35:12,958 --> 04:35:15,118
another stuff for the for that there's

4799
04:35:15,118 --> 04:35:16,799
stuff about mine in the middle then

4800
04:35:16,799 --> 04:35:18,240
repackaging is interesting right so

4801
04:35:18,240 --> 04:35:19,680
another thing you can do with electron

4802
04:35:19,680 --> 04:35:21,520
applications is

4803
04:35:21,520 --> 04:35:22,879
you can

4804
04:35:22,879 --> 04:35:24,879
extract the application then modify it

4805
04:35:24,879 --> 04:35:26,639
as you wish and then run it again right

4806
04:35:26,639 --> 04:35:28,799
so so this is a

4807
04:35:28,799 --> 04:35:31,599
a very interesting concept and also much

4808
04:35:31,599 --> 04:35:33,359
easier to do on electron applications

4809
04:35:33,359 --> 04:35:34,799
than uh

4810
04:35:34,799 --> 04:35:36,160
than on mobile applications where you

4811
04:35:36,160 --> 04:35:37,919
have to normally install the application

4812
04:35:37,919 --> 04:35:38,879
again

4813
04:35:38,879 --> 04:35:40,000
then there's another one about

4814
04:35:40,000 --> 04:35:41,438
instrumentation so modifying the

4815
04:35:41,438 --> 04:35:43,039
application at runtime so you can

4816
04:35:43,039 --> 04:35:47,278
achieve that with frida and other tools

4817
04:35:47,278 --> 04:35:48,958
and then from here we will be doing a

4818
04:35:48,958 --> 04:35:51,359
bit of attacking um

4819
04:35:51,359 --> 04:35:54,958
electron applications with file urls and

4820
04:35:54,958 --> 04:35:56,639
in windows so i'll show a demo about

4821
04:35:56,639 --> 04:35:58,160
that in a second

4822
04:35:58,160 --> 04:36:00,160
you can also exfiltrate data because

4823
04:36:00,160 --> 04:36:02,000
when you get when you have xss on the

4824
04:36:02,000 --> 04:36:03,520
desktop application

4825
04:36:03,520 --> 04:36:06,000
if the xss is working from a file url in

4826
04:36:06,000 --> 04:36:08,240
many cases you can

4827
04:36:08,240 --> 04:36:10,080
you know retrieve local files and send

4828
04:36:10,080 --> 04:36:12,240
them to an attacker and then today we

4829
04:36:12,240 --> 04:36:14,561
will have also a demo about this ipc

4830
04:36:14,561 --> 04:36:16,480
remote execution

4831
04:36:16,480 --> 04:36:19,199
so i'll just talk about this later than

4832
04:36:19,199 --> 04:36:21,039
this defeating opinion and all the stuff

4833
04:36:21,039 --> 04:36:22,719
and then this is also interesting right

4834
04:36:22,719 --> 04:36:23,759
because

4835
04:36:23,759 --> 04:36:25,680
we call this like hacking javascript

4836
04:36:25,680 --> 04:36:27,438
desktop applications so you're supposed

4837
04:36:27,438 --> 04:36:30,320
to attack the desktop but sometimes and

4838
04:36:30,320 --> 04:36:32,000
we found this in real pentest you can

4839
04:36:32,000 --> 04:36:32,958
have

4840
04:36:32,958 --> 04:36:35,840
electron components as part of a web

4841
04:36:35,840 --> 04:36:37,199
application

4842
04:36:37,199 --> 04:36:39,118
and then suddenly all these attack

4843
04:36:39,118 --> 04:36:42,080
techniques can actually serve you well

4844
04:36:42,080 --> 04:36:44,799
to hack a web server right so

4845
04:36:44,799 --> 04:36:46,400
that's all an interesting

4846
04:36:46,400 --> 04:36:48,320
uh council right so there's a lot about

4847
04:36:48,320 --> 04:36:49,278
that and then there's another

4848
04:36:49,278 --> 04:36:51,278
possibility would be uh privileged local

4849
04:36:51,278 --> 04:36:53,520
privilege collation and stuff right so

4850
04:36:53,520 --> 04:36:55,599
okay so with that out of the way let's

4851
04:36:55,599 --> 04:36:58,320
start like let's pretend like you have

4852
04:36:58,320 --> 04:37:00,561
no idea about electron security where do

4853
04:37:00,561 --> 04:37:02,000
you start right

4854
04:37:02,000 --> 04:37:03,438
so first of all

4855
04:37:03,438 --> 04:37:05,118
why are people doing this right so a lot

4856
04:37:05,118 --> 04:37:07,039
of security people are probably

4857
04:37:07,039 --> 04:37:08,320
wondering like

4858
04:37:08,320 --> 04:37:10,160
why risk it right run javascript on the

4859
04:37:10,160 --> 04:37:12,160
desktop if there's so many problems with

4860
04:37:12,160 --> 04:37:14,799
xss and so on right so

4861
04:37:14,799 --> 04:37:17,118
the main reason is that normally you are

4862
04:37:17,118 --> 04:37:18,561
going to have

4863
04:37:18,561 --> 04:37:20,320
three developer teams right so this was

4864
04:37:20,320 --> 04:37:21,438
the classic

4865
04:37:21,438 --> 04:37:23,039
desktop application development so you

4866
04:37:23,039 --> 04:37:24,320
will have to pay

4867
04:37:24,320 --> 04:37:26,160
windows developers linux developers mac

4868
04:37:26,160 --> 04:37:28,561
developers this is expensive it is three

4869
04:37:28,561 --> 04:37:30,160
different

4870
04:37:30,160 --> 04:37:32,400
development teams with different skills

4871
04:37:32,400 --> 04:37:34,639
they have to be coordinated

4872
04:37:34,639 --> 04:37:36,799
it's expensive right

4873
04:37:36,799 --> 04:37:40,400
but with electron now you lower the bar

4874
04:37:40,400 --> 04:37:42,400
to just javascript developers right

4875
04:37:42,400 --> 04:37:43,680
because there's more javascript

4876
04:37:43,680 --> 04:37:45,520
developers like let's say

4877
04:37:45,520 --> 04:37:48,160
c sharp developers for windows or you

4878
04:37:48,160 --> 04:37:48,879
know

4879
04:37:48,879 --> 04:37:51,520
linux developers and so on right so it

4880
04:37:51,520 --> 04:37:53,438
is easier to find javascript developers

4881
04:37:53,438 --> 04:37:56,719
so you have to pay them less and also

4882
04:37:56,719 --> 04:37:57,520
the

4883
04:37:57,520 --> 04:37:59,599
there's only one development team so you

4884
04:37:59,599 --> 04:38:00,958
only have to pay one development team

4885
04:38:00,958 --> 04:38:02,799
instead of three right so

4886
04:38:02,799 --> 04:38:04,958
this is uh probably one of the top

4887
04:38:04,958 --> 04:38:07,438
reasons why people are using electron

4888
04:38:07,438 --> 04:38:08,639
and then the next question you might

4889
04:38:08,639 --> 04:38:10,400
have is well who's actually doing this

4890
04:38:10,400 --> 04:38:12,719
right so you can probably recognize some

4891
04:38:12,719 --> 04:38:14,400
logos here right so microsoft teams

4892
04:38:14,400 --> 04:38:16,639
skype zooms like discord bit garden

4893
04:38:16,639 --> 04:38:19,359
gitlab signal and many others

4894
04:38:19,359 --> 04:38:20,400
so

4895
04:38:20,400 --> 04:38:22,879
to understand uh

4896
04:38:22,879 --> 04:38:24,561
these many of the attacks that i'm going

4897
04:38:24,561 --> 04:38:25,599
to show

4898
04:38:25,599 --> 04:38:27,278
when you click on for example the

4899
04:38:27,278 --> 04:38:29,520
discord application the first thing that

4900
04:38:29,520 --> 04:38:31,118
happens so let's pretend this is the

4901
04:38:31,118 --> 04:38:32,639
discord application you click on it the

4902
04:38:32,639 --> 04:38:34,000
first thing that happens is that the

4903
04:38:34,000 --> 04:38:36,160
main process starts right so main

4904
04:38:36,160 --> 04:38:38,480
process more privilege can do more stuff

4905
04:38:38,480 --> 04:38:40,561
and then the main process eventually it

4906
04:38:40,561 --> 04:38:43,359
will create a window with which the user

4907
04:38:43,359 --> 04:38:44,879
will interact with right so this will be

4908
04:38:44,879 --> 04:38:46,799
the render process more exposed to the

4909
04:38:46,799 --> 04:38:48,879
user normally xss is going to happen

4910
04:38:48,879 --> 04:38:50,400
here

4911
04:38:50,400 --> 04:38:52,958
and with security settings you can kind

4912
04:38:52,958 --> 04:38:54,000
of uh

4913
04:38:54,000 --> 04:38:56,879
you know protect this a bit better uh

4914
04:38:56,879 --> 04:38:58,240
here if you have access here you're

4915
04:38:58,240 --> 04:38:59,919
pretty much done because this has access

4916
04:38:59,919 --> 04:39:01,199
to everything right

4917
04:39:01,199 --> 04:39:02,719
but these there's some mechanisms to

4918
04:39:02,719 --> 04:39:04,719
lock this down so we will go

4919
04:39:04,719 --> 04:39:08,400
to uh about some of that today so

4920
04:39:08,400 --> 04:39:10,320
you have the operating system right so

4921
04:39:10,320 --> 04:39:12,719
windows micro linux normally

4922
04:39:12,719 --> 04:39:13,520
uh

4923
04:39:13,520 --> 04:39:15,278
then the electron

4924
04:39:15,278 --> 04:39:17,359
core is going to abstract all that from

4925
04:39:17,359 --> 04:39:19,118
the application and it will interact

4926
04:39:19,118 --> 04:39:20,719
through apis with the operating system

4927
04:39:20,719 --> 04:39:22,639
and then there's the main process

4928
04:39:22,639 --> 04:39:24,320
the render process they can talk to each

4929
04:39:24,320 --> 04:39:26,240
other through ipc which is a fancy way

4930
04:39:26,240 --> 04:39:28,320
of saying they send json to each other

4931
04:39:28,320 --> 04:39:30,080
so inter-process communication and then

4932
04:39:30,080 --> 04:39:32,639
some api calls to electron on both of

4933
04:39:32,639 --> 04:39:34,400
them as well

4934
04:39:34,400 --> 04:39:37,118
so main process can do more stuff

4935
04:39:37,118 --> 04:39:38,878
more privileged if you have accesses

4936
04:39:38,878 --> 04:39:40,400
there you're pretty much done

4937
04:39:40,400 --> 04:39:42,798
uh render a process more exposed to the

4938
04:39:42,798 --> 04:39:45,360
user can do less stuff but can be locked

4939
04:39:45,360 --> 04:39:47,600
down a bit a bit more and also very

4940
04:39:47,600 --> 04:39:49,600
important this is all based on node.js

4941
04:39:49,600 --> 04:39:52,798
right so you have um well i think i have

4942
04:39:52,798 --> 04:39:54,160
another okay now

4943
04:39:54,160 --> 04:39:55,120
so

4944
04:39:55,120 --> 04:39:56,240
you have

4945
04:39:56,240 --> 04:39:58,240
the google v8 engine that allows you to

4946
04:39:58,240 --> 04:40:00,718
run javascript on a server like with

4947
04:40:00,718 --> 04:40:04,320
node.js but also on a desktop computer

4948
04:40:04,320 --> 04:40:06,560
then on top of that this node.js on top

4949
04:40:06,560 --> 04:40:08,480
of that this electron and then electrode

4950
04:40:08,480 --> 04:40:10,240
will have these two types of processes

4951
04:40:10,240 --> 04:40:11,760
the main process and the render process

4952
04:40:11,760 --> 04:40:12,560
so

4953
04:40:12,560 --> 04:40:14,400
if you have no idea you have never seen

4954
04:40:14,400 --> 04:40:15,920
an electron application where do you

4955
04:40:15,920 --> 04:40:18,320
start right so one thing that you can do

4956
04:40:18,320 --> 04:40:19,840
is download

4957
04:40:19,840 --> 04:40:22,240
a very old application from the internet

4958
04:40:22,240 --> 04:40:24,000
so in this case this is a standard nodes

4959
04:40:24,000 --> 04:40:25,920
version two which is very old and then

4960
04:40:25,920 --> 04:40:27,360
over time there's going to be a lot of

4961
04:40:27,360 --> 04:40:28,798
vulnerabilities discovered in the

4962
04:40:28,798 --> 04:40:30,878
underlying packages so you can download

4963
04:40:30,878 --> 04:40:32,958
it and run npm audit

4964
04:40:32,958 --> 04:40:34,798
so the first time you run

4965
04:40:34,798 --> 04:40:37,200
so npm audit is here

4966
04:40:37,200 --> 04:40:38,878
so the first time you run npm mode you

4967
04:40:38,878 --> 04:40:40,320
might get this error message the error

4968
04:40:40,320 --> 04:40:42,798
message tells you what you need to do so

4969
04:40:42,798 --> 04:40:45,680
when you get this is because um

4970
04:40:45,680 --> 04:40:47,840
you can have a dependency that has a

4971
04:40:47,840 --> 04:40:49,360
dependency that has a dependency so the

4972
04:40:49,360 --> 04:40:51,280
tree of dependencies has to be resolved

4973
04:40:51,280 --> 04:40:52,160
first

4974
04:40:52,160 --> 04:40:53,680
and then

4975
04:40:53,680 --> 04:40:55,760
this will create this package log only

4976
04:40:55,760 --> 04:40:58,080
file and then you can run npm audit and

4977
04:40:58,080 --> 04:40:59,600
then you will get like some

4978
04:40:59,600 --> 04:41:01,840
vulnerabilities with this right

4979
04:41:01,840 --> 04:41:03,360
so

4980
04:41:03,360 --> 04:41:04,480
then for

4981
04:41:04,480 --> 04:41:07,600
let me drink something

4982
04:41:10,000 --> 04:41:11,520
another thing you can do is to find

4983
04:41:11,520 --> 04:41:14,080
vulnerabilities in the configuration so

4984
04:41:14,080 --> 04:41:16,160
for this exercise

4985
04:41:16,160 --> 04:41:17,920
we'll use the vulnerable

4986
04:41:17,920 --> 04:41:20,480
the vulnerable one application

4987
04:41:20,480 --> 04:41:22,798
uh if you try wget it won't work but

4988
04:41:22,798 --> 04:41:24,080
again if you go to serious security

4989
04:41:24,080 --> 04:41:26,000
comes last three you can get access to

4990
04:41:26,000 --> 04:41:27,440
all this and then you can download the

4991
04:41:27,440 --> 04:41:29,360
app from there and try this on your own

4992
04:41:29,360 --> 04:41:31,120
later on so the first thing to do is to

4993
04:41:31,120 --> 04:41:32,878
look at package.json

4994
04:41:32,878 --> 04:41:35,680
and this will have a main entry point

4995
04:41:35,680 --> 04:41:37,680
uh in this case the main entry point is

4996
04:41:37,680 --> 04:41:40,160
main.js and you can see here that we

4997
04:41:40,160 --> 04:41:42,560
have web preferences so node integration

4998
04:41:42,560 --> 04:41:44,560
is set to true which is bad and context

4999
04:41:44,560 --> 04:41:46,400
isolation is set to false which is also

5000
04:41:46,400 --> 04:41:47,200
bad

5001
04:41:47,200 --> 04:41:49,520
so why are these things bad

5002
04:41:49,520 --> 04:41:51,760
if node integration is enabled

5003
04:41:51,760 --> 04:41:54,080
the impact of any xss is immediately

5004
04:41:54,080 --> 04:41:55,440
code execution

5005
04:41:55,440 --> 04:41:58,160
right so i'll demonstrate this in a few

5006
04:41:58,160 --> 04:42:00,560
in a moment and when context isolation

5007
04:42:00,560 --> 04:42:03,440
is disabled this means we can mess the

5008
04:42:03,440 --> 04:42:04,798
javascript is running in the same

5009
04:42:04,798 --> 04:42:06,958
context

5010
04:42:06,958 --> 04:42:08,638
the um the

5011
04:42:08,638 --> 04:42:11,120
javascript on the user uh html is

5012
04:42:11,120 --> 04:42:12,320
running in the same context as the

5013
04:42:12,320 --> 04:42:14,878
javascript of the application so with an

5014
04:42:14,878 --> 04:42:16,560
xss you can kind of mess with the

5015
04:42:16,560 --> 04:42:18,000
application so i'll demonstrate this

5016
04:42:18,000 --> 04:42:19,760
later on and it will make

5017
04:42:19,760 --> 04:42:21,680
more sense then

5018
04:42:21,680 --> 04:42:23,520
does anybody see a problem with this

5019
04:42:23,520 --> 04:42:24,480
code

5020
04:42:24,480 --> 04:42:25,520
any

5021
04:42:25,520 --> 04:42:28,480
takers guessers

5022
04:42:32,638 --> 04:42:36,400
okay so we have a user input assignment

5023
04:42:36,400 --> 04:42:37,920
there's the message and it's assigned to

5024
04:42:37,920 --> 04:42:40,160
inner html so we have uh dom xss

5025
04:42:40,160 --> 04:42:41,840
vulnerability

5026
04:42:41,840 --> 04:42:44,000
now if you are interested on this uh

5027
04:42:44,000 --> 04:42:46,080
there's a dom access wiki that lists all

5028
04:42:46,080 --> 04:42:48,160
the things as sources right so sync is a

5029
04:42:48,160 --> 04:42:49,680
place in javascript where if you assign

5030
04:42:49,680 --> 04:42:51,200
user input there you're going to get dom

5031
04:42:51,200 --> 04:42:53,600
xss and source would be where user input

5032
04:42:53,600 --> 04:42:55,440
comes from right so location hash and

5033
04:42:55,440 --> 04:42:57,200
other places like that

5034
04:42:57,200 --> 04:42:59,120
okay so very good

5035
04:42:59,120 --> 04:43:01,520
then another thing you can do is to run

5036
04:43:01,520 --> 04:43:03,360
electronegativity right so this will

5037
04:43:03,360 --> 04:43:05,120
check um

5038
04:43:05,120 --> 04:43:06,958
so first thing to do is npm install add

5039
04:43:06,958 --> 04:43:08,480
toyon sec which is the company that

5040
04:43:08,480 --> 04:43:09,760
maintains this

5041
04:43:09,760 --> 04:43:11,360
electronegativity and then you have to

5042
04:43:11,360 --> 04:43:13,120
use the g at the end to install this

5043
04:43:13,120 --> 04:43:15,280
globally and then this will look for

5044
04:43:15,280 --> 04:43:16,480
vulnerabilities in electron

5045
04:43:16,480 --> 04:43:17,920
configuration and so on and here you

5046
04:43:17,920 --> 04:43:19,920
will get like some results like with the

5047
04:43:19,920 --> 04:43:22,320
affected files and the lines

5048
04:43:22,320 --> 04:43:23,840
and so on right so in this case you can

5049
04:43:23,840 --> 04:43:26,798
see the problems of main.js

5050
04:43:26,798 --> 04:43:28,560
these are the affected lines so between

5051
04:43:28,560 --> 04:43:30,718
line 7 and line 21

5052
04:43:30,718 --> 04:43:32,240
here you have a link to read more about

5053
04:43:32,240 --> 04:43:33,760
it and then there's like some

5054
04:43:33,760 --> 04:43:37,360
preliminary severity there so let's do a

5055
04:43:37,360 --> 04:43:39,920
demo about this

5056
04:43:39,920 --> 04:43:42,560
you can see this yes

5057
04:43:42,560 --> 04:43:45,040
okay so i'm just going to run npm audit

5058
04:43:45,040 --> 04:43:47,120
right so this is just you just do npm

5059
04:43:47,120 --> 04:43:48,560
audits on

5060
04:43:48,560 --> 04:43:50,560
standard nodes and you can see here like

5061
04:43:50,560 --> 04:43:51,840
we get

5062
04:43:51,840 --> 04:43:53,440
some findings

5063
04:43:53,440 --> 04:43:55,600
right so for low moderate

5064
04:43:55,600 --> 04:43:57,760
18 high eight critical so this because

5065
04:43:57,760 --> 04:43:59,760
it's a very old version so this will

5066
04:43:59,760 --> 04:44:01,120
happen with any

5067
04:44:01,120 --> 04:44:02,638
application

5068
04:44:02,638 --> 04:44:04,080
then for the configuration the first

5069
04:44:04,080 --> 04:44:06,000
thing to do is to look at package.json

5070
04:44:06,000 --> 04:44:08,080
so i'm going here for the main entry

5071
04:44:08,080 --> 04:44:10,878
point you can see that this is main.js

5072
04:44:10,878 --> 04:44:12,878
is in this case the main entry point so

5073
04:44:12,878 --> 04:44:15,600
then i can go into main.js

5074
04:44:15,600 --> 04:44:18,000
and here we can see node integration is

5075
04:44:18,000 --> 04:44:20,160
set to true which is bad and context

5076
04:44:20,160 --> 04:44:22,718
isolation is set to false which is bad

5077
04:44:22,718 --> 04:44:23,760
right

5078
04:44:23,760 --> 04:44:27,120
then on the renderer.js we have

5079
04:44:27,120 --> 04:44:29,280
the vulnerability so this would be the

5080
04:44:29,280 --> 04:44:31,120
vulnerable code where user input is

5081
04:44:31,120 --> 04:44:34,160
assigned to inner html and this would be

5082
04:44:34,160 --> 04:44:36,080
uh you know a proper

5083
04:44:36,080 --> 04:44:37,840
way to fix it right so i'll elaborate

5084
04:44:37,840 --> 04:44:40,160
more about this

5085
04:44:40,160 --> 04:44:41,600
in a second on the slides and then

5086
04:44:41,600 --> 04:44:43,280
electronic activity you just run it like

5087
04:44:43,280 --> 04:44:44,160
this

5088
04:44:44,160 --> 04:44:46,160
so you pass it the directory where the

5089
04:44:46,160 --> 04:44:48,160
application has been extracted in this

5090
04:44:48,160 --> 04:44:50,718
case it's vulnerable one so

5091
04:44:50,718 --> 04:44:53,040
now uh you can see that you get like all

5092
04:44:53,040 --> 04:44:56,560
the results uh pretty quick right

5093
04:44:56,560 --> 04:44:57,920
okay so

5094
04:44:57,920 --> 04:44:59,200
now let's see

5095
04:44:59,200 --> 04:45:00,718
let's make this more interesting and

5096
04:45:00,718 --> 04:45:02,718
start hacking stuff

5097
04:45:02,718 --> 04:45:04,798
so what does xss mean in the context of

5098
04:45:04,798 --> 04:45:07,040
a desktop application and how to turn

5099
04:45:07,040 --> 04:45:09,200
xss into code execution right so for

5100
04:45:09,200 --> 04:45:10,878
this we will keep using the vulnerable

5101
04:45:10,878 --> 04:45:12,878
one application

5102
04:45:12,878 --> 04:45:14,958
now since we have to run it

5103
04:45:14,958 --> 04:45:16,878
i told you like electron applications

5104
04:45:16,878 --> 04:45:19,280
are based on node.js and so on so the

5105
04:45:19,280 --> 04:45:21,520
zip only has the electron source code so

5106
04:45:21,520 --> 04:45:23,360
you have to do npm install first and

5107
04:45:23,360 --> 04:45:25,040
this will install electron node.js and

5108
04:45:25,040 --> 04:45:27,120
so on locally on the directory and only

5109
04:45:27,120 --> 04:45:29,680
then you can do npm start and then the

5110
04:45:29,680 --> 04:45:32,718
application will run just fine right

5111
04:45:32,718 --> 04:45:34,080
now another trick that you can do

5112
04:45:34,080 --> 04:45:36,000
against electron applications is use

5113
04:45:36,000 --> 04:45:39,200
these keyboard combinations so

5114
04:45:39,200 --> 04:45:41,120
the developers can disable this but most

5115
04:45:41,120 --> 04:45:43,600
of the time they don't so if you do ctrl

5116
04:45:43,600 --> 04:45:45,520
shift i or command shift if you have a

5117
04:45:45,520 --> 04:45:46,480
mac

5118
04:45:46,480 --> 04:45:48,160
this will open the developer tools and

5119
04:45:48,160 --> 04:45:49,280
then you can

5120
04:45:49,280 --> 04:45:51,680
kind of like debug what's going on if

5121
04:45:51,680 --> 04:45:53,680
they are output encoding correctly and

5122
04:45:53,680 --> 04:45:55,840
so on right now if you come from a web

5123
04:45:55,840 --> 04:45:57,840
security background you might attempt

5124
04:45:57,840 --> 04:45:59,200
like some payloads like this right

5125
04:45:59,200 --> 04:46:01,200
script alert one and so on

5126
04:46:01,200 --> 04:46:03,040
and in this case in this particular

5127
04:46:03,040 --> 04:46:04,400
application you will notice this doesn't

5128
04:46:04,400 --> 04:46:05,200
work

5129
04:46:05,200 --> 04:46:07,040
however in the developer tools you can

5130
04:46:07,040 --> 04:46:08,718
see that the injection was successful

5131
04:46:08,718 --> 04:46:10,638
it's just the alert is not running so

5132
04:46:10,638 --> 04:46:12,320
this is expected this is according to

5133
04:46:12,320 --> 04:46:14,320
the rfc if the page has already been

5134
04:46:14,320 --> 04:46:16,080
rendered

5135
04:46:16,080 --> 04:46:20,520
the script is not meant to be executed

5136
04:46:21,840 --> 04:46:23,520
however

5137
04:46:23,520 --> 04:46:25,120
we can get around this with just an

5138
04:46:25,120 --> 04:46:27,360
image so you just put like a bronchi

5139
04:46:27,360 --> 04:46:29,600
image and then with the error handler we

5140
04:46:29,600 --> 04:46:31,360
can get the alert working right so we

5141
04:46:31,360 --> 04:46:33,200
got alert one which is nice but we can

5142
04:46:33,200 --> 04:46:35,120
do more with this right since node

5143
04:46:35,120 --> 04:46:36,958
integration is enabled

5144
04:46:36,958 --> 04:46:39,520
i told you any xss will be immediate

5145
04:46:39,520 --> 04:46:42,000
code execution right so what we can do

5146
04:46:42,000 --> 04:46:43,840
and you can copy this from this link

5147
04:46:43,840 --> 04:46:45,040
these payloads

5148
04:46:45,040 --> 04:46:47,040
so what we can do is

5149
04:46:47,040 --> 04:46:49,920
invoke any node.js module so there's no

5150
04:46:49,920 --> 04:46:51,680
js modules that allow us to run

5151
04:46:51,680 --> 04:46:53,840
operating system commands like uh

5152
04:46:53,840 --> 04:46:55,520
required child process so this would be

5153
04:46:55,520 --> 04:46:57,920
the node.js module and then this exact

5154
04:46:57,920 --> 04:46:59,840
sync now you always want to shoot for

5155
04:46:59,840 --> 04:47:01,680
the synchronous functions

5156
04:47:01,680 --> 04:47:03,680
so that the function finishes and then

5157
04:47:03,680 --> 04:47:05,920
you get the result and then you get it

5158
04:47:05,920 --> 04:47:08,400
back in the alert because if you don't

5159
04:47:08,400 --> 04:47:10,000
use the sync function sometimes what

5160
04:47:10,000 --> 04:47:12,400
happens is you your code execution is

5161
04:47:12,400 --> 04:47:14,560
working but because of the synchronous

5162
04:47:14,560 --> 04:47:16,638
nature you don't get there is all back

5163
04:47:16,638 --> 04:47:18,560
so it's kind of weird

5164
04:47:18,560 --> 04:47:20,958
uh yeah so

5165
04:47:20,958 --> 04:47:23,440
so then uh you know you can try this and

5166
04:47:23,440 --> 04:47:25,040
then you can see here like you can run

5167
04:47:25,040 --> 04:47:26,718
any operating system command one but

5168
04:47:26,718 --> 04:47:28,080
you're not limited to just running

5169
04:47:28,080 --> 04:47:30,798
operating system commands you can also

5170
04:47:30,798 --> 04:47:32,240
load all the modules for example to

5171
04:47:32,240 --> 04:47:34,080
interact with the file system read local

5172
04:47:34,080 --> 04:47:36,160
files and so on

5173
04:47:36,160 --> 04:47:39,280
then for the developers out there or the

5174
04:47:39,280 --> 04:47:41,360
penetration testers that want to provide

5175
04:47:41,360 --> 04:47:42,840
proper

5176
04:47:42,840 --> 04:47:44,080
mitigation uh

5177
04:47:44,080 --> 04:47:46,320
recommendations in their pentax reports

5178
04:47:46,320 --> 04:47:47,840
let's talk a little bit about how to

5179
04:47:47,840 --> 04:47:49,440
mitigate this right so you should always

5180
04:47:49,440 --> 04:47:50,320
view

5181
04:47:50,320 --> 04:47:52,878
uh security as uh

5182
04:47:52,878 --> 04:47:54,320
like a little bit like an audio right as

5183
04:47:54,320 --> 04:47:55,680
you should have like several layers of

5184
04:47:55,680 --> 04:47:57,600
security right so one layer of security

5185
04:47:57,600 --> 04:47:59,600
would be to disable node integration so

5186
04:47:59,600 --> 04:48:01,520
this will reduce the impact

5187
04:48:01,520 --> 04:48:03,760
from direct code execution to

5188
04:48:03,760 --> 04:48:05,600
just alert one right so

5189
04:48:05,600 --> 04:48:07,920
you reduce the impact a little bit

5190
04:48:07,920 --> 04:48:09,360
and when you do this you will notice

5191
04:48:09,360 --> 04:48:11,520
that you get this error require is not

5192
04:48:11,520 --> 04:48:13,440
defined you can no longer

5193
04:48:13,440 --> 04:48:16,400
load node.js uh modules right so this is

5194
04:48:16,400 --> 04:48:17,840
why you get this error message so this

5195
04:48:17,840 --> 04:48:19,520
is kind of the first layer that you

5196
04:48:19,520 --> 04:48:21,040
could implement

5197
04:48:21,040 --> 04:48:23,440
then uh of course we still have accesses

5198
04:48:23,440 --> 04:48:25,120
right so if you try

5199
04:48:25,120 --> 04:48:28,480
alert one the alert one will still work

5200
04:48:28,480 --> 04:48:29,840
and then what you can do is implement

5201
04:48:29,840 --> 04:48:32,480
some content security policy to you know

5202
04:48:32,480 --> 04:48:34,320
make it a little bit tougher

5203
04:48:34,320 --> 04:48:37,440
for um xss to happen right so this is

5204
04:48:37,440 --> 04:48:38,560
going to

5205
04:48:38,560 --> 04:48:41,360
in case you forget some access somewhere

5206
04:48:41,360 --> 04:48:43,120
this will make it more difficult and

5207
04:48:43,120 --> 04:48:45,120
hopefully unexploitable right so that's

5208
04:48:45,120 --> 04:48:47,520
the that's the hope and then you do npm

5209
04:48:47,520 --> 04:48:49,120
start again so you close the application

5210
04:48:49,120 --> 04:48:51,840
then run npm start again and when you

5211
04:48:51,840 --> 04:48:54,160
try this you will see this error message

5212
04:48:54,160 --> 04:48:56,080
right refuse to execute inline event

5213
04:48:56,080 --> 04:48:57,600
handler because it violates the

5214
04:48:57,600 --> 04:48:59,680
following content security policy

5215
04:48:59,680 --> 04:49:01,760
directive and so on right so this would

5216
04:49:01,760 --> 04:49:03,280
be another layer but we still have an

5217
04:49:03,280 --> 04:49:05,440
access right so you also should add

5218
04:49:05,440 --> 04:49:07,760
another layer of defense which would be

5219
04:49:07,760 --> 04:49:09,520
fixing the xss which is actually the

5220
04:49:09,520 --> 04:49:11,920
most important thing

5221
04:49:11,920 --> 04:49:14,400
so the best way would be to avoid the

5222
04:49:14,400 --> 04:49:16,080
domex assessing so instead of using

5223
04:49:16,080 --> 04:49:19,280
inner html use text content

5224
04:49:19,280 --> 04:49:21,120
and then when you try this again you

5225
04:49:21,120 --> 04:49:23,040
will see in the developer tools

5226
04:49:23,040 --> 04:49:25,680
that the html characters have been like

5227
04:49:25,680 --> 04:49:27,680
encoded correctly and this is displayed

5228
04:49:27,680 --> 04:49:29,840
as text so this is solved but what

5229
04:49:29,840 --> 04:49:31,440
happens if you have

5230
04:49:31,440 --> 04:49:33,600
some rich text editor and you want to

5231
04:49:33,600 --> 04:49:35,440
allow some html tags and so on so in

5232
04:49:35,440 --> 04:49:37,360
those cases you should use like a well

5233
04:49:37,360 --> 04:49:39,360
hammered

5234
04:49:39,360 --> 04:49:41,600
library that for sanitization so then

5235
04:49:41,600 --> 04:49:43,840
purify is a good choice for this so you

5236
04:49:43,840 --> 04:49:45,680
can install them purify like npm

5237
04:49:45,680 --> 04:49:47,600
installed on purify on the directory of

5238
04:49:47,600 --> 04:49:49,920
the app this will add it as a dependency

5239
04:49:49,920 --> 04:49:52,080
and then you just load it

5240
04:49:52,080 --> 04:49:55,040
and here you just do inner html

5241
04:49:55,040 --> 04:49:57,200
but you do the purify of sanitize

5242
04:49:57,200 --> 04:49:58,958
message now a better way would be here

5243
04:49:58,958 --> 04:50:01,840
to add a white list of the html tags you

5244
04:50:01,840 --> 04:50:03,760
want to allow so for example

5245
04:50:03,760 --> 04:50:08,240
only allow underlying bold and so on

5246
04:50:08,240 --> 04:50:10,240
and this would be even even tougher to

5247
04:50:10,240 --> 04:50:12,080
to bypass and then when you try this you

5248
04:50:12,080 --> 04:50:14,798
try some exercise payloads you will see

5249
04:50:14,798 --> 04:50:17,760
that you know damage source x and so on

5250
04:50:17,760 --> 04:50:19,760
is there so you still have the injection

5251
04:50:19,760 --> 04:50:21,680
because you're allowing some html but

5252
04:50:21,680 --> 04:50:23,920
the owner and so on all the javascript

5253
04:50:23,920 --> 04:50:27,120
stuff has been removed right so let's do

5254
04:50:27,120 --> 04:50:30,000
a quick demo about this

5255
04:50:30,000 --> 04:50:33,760
before we start to complicate things

5256
04:50:33,760 --> 04:50:36,240
so i'm running here the vulnerable one

5257
04:50:36,240 --> 04:50:37,600
application

5258
04:50:37,600 --> 04:50:39,120
uh

5259
04:50:39,120 --> 04:50:42,878
i'll try to make this a bit bigger

5260
04:50:43,440 --> 04:50:46,440
view

5261
04:50:46,560 --> 04:50:48,718
can you read this

5262
04:50:48,718 --> 04:50:50,798
yeah it's visible right

5263
04:50:50,798 --> 04:50:53,520
okay so

5264
04:50:54,958 --> 04:50:57,600
so i'm just going to

5265
04:50:57,600 --> 04:51:00,000
try them

5266
04:51:00,000 --> 04:51:02,240
not that

5267
04:51:02,240 --> 04:51:05,600
i'm just going to try the

5268
04:51:06,000 --> 04:51:10,400
linux payloads because i'm in linux so

5269
04:51:11,360 --> 04:51:13,280
so i'm sending these payloads at once

5270
04:51:13,280 --> 04:51:18,320
right so this is the output of unnamed a

5271
04:51:18,638 --> 04:51:20,560
then now this one is taking longer so

5272
04:51:20,560 --> 04:51:23,360
this is the genome calculator

5273
04:51:23,360 --> 04:51:25,200
then

5274
04:51:25,200 --> 04:51:28,160
let's see where's my mass

5275
04:51:28,160 --> 04:51:29,600
then because the genome calculator

5276
04:51:29,600 --> 04:51:31,120
doesn't return anything you get a blank

5277
04:51:31,120 --> 04:51:32,878
alert

5278
04:51:32,878 --> 04:51:36,160
this is the output of the id command

5279
04:51:36,160 --> 04:51:37,680
and this is the output of the ls command

5280
04:51:37,680 --> 04:51:38,878
right so basically you can run any

5281
04:51:38,878 --> 04:51:40,480
command you want but as i said you could

5282
04:51:40,480 --> 04:51:41,920
require instead of required child

5283
04:51:41,920 --> 04:51:43,600
process you could require fs or you

5284
04:51:43,600 --> 04:51:45,680
could require other node.js modules and

5285
04:51:45,680 --> 04:51:47,360
do other stuff but most of the time

5286
04:51:47,360 --> 04:51:48,638
people are going to use this just

5287
04:51:48,638 --> 04:51:51,840
because you know it's just easier to to

5288
04:51:51,840 --> 04:51:53,680
demonstrate

5289
04:51:53,680 --> 04:51:54,840
okay

5290
04:51:54,840 --> 04:51:56,878
so uh

5291
04:51:56,878 --> 04:51:59,520
so this shows you a bit uh you know the

5292
04:51:59,520 --> 04:52:01,920
problem of having uh node integration

5293
04:52:01,920 --> 04:52:04,400
enabled and what we will be talking

5294
04:52:04,400 --> 04:52:06,160
about now is how to attack preload

5295
04:52:06,160 --> 04:52:08,240
scripts right so for this i'm going to

5296
04:52:08,240 --> 04:52:10,400
start booting my

5297
04:52:10,400 --> 04:52:13,920
windows vm i think is this one

5298
04:52:13,920 --> 04:52:16,080
so

5299
04:52:16,080 --> 04:52:17,600
now for this one we will be using the

5300
04:52:17,600 --> 04:52:19,760
vulnerable 2

5301
04:52:19,760 --> 04:52:21,440
application and this is what happens

5302
04:52:21,440 --> 04:52:23,360
right so when context isolation is set

5303
04:52:23,360 --> 04:52:25,440
to false

5304
04:52:25,440 --> 04:52:27,200
the preload script runs in the same

5305
04:52:27,200 --> 04:52:29,280
context as the electron application so

5306
04:52:29,280 --> 04:52:31,280
if the preload script has window abc

5307
04:52:31,280 --> 04:52:32,798
equals one to three and you alert the

5308
04:52:32,798 --> 04:52:34,878
window abc is going to be one two three

5309
04:52:34,878 --> 04:52:36,638
on the xss

5310
04:52:36,638 --> 04:52:38,718
and when context isolation is set to

5311
04:52:38,718 --> 04:52:39,840
true

5312
04:52:39,840 --> 04:52:42,480
then this will return undefined right so

5313
04:52:42,480 --> 04:52:44,240
this is why it provides better security

5314
04:52:44,240 --> 04:52:46,240
because basically you cannot mess with

5315
04:52:46,240 --> 04:52:48,480
the preload script so

5316
04:52:48,480 --> 04:52:50,878
uh i'll i think i'm going to show this

5317
04:52:50,878 --> 04:52:52,480
in the demo but basically the idea of

5318
04:52:52,480 --> 04:52:55,440
this is with an xss we can redefine

5319
04:52:55,440 --> 04:52:56,560
a function right so we will be

5320
04:52:56,560 --> 04:52:57,920
redefining

5321
04:52:57,920 --> 04:52:59,680
how the index of function works in

5322
04:52:59,680 --> 04:53:00,878
javascript

5323
04:53:00,878 --> 04:53:03,360
and then this will allow us to bypass

5324
04:53:03,360 --> 04:53:05,600
a security check so i'll just show it

5325
04:53:05,600 --> 04:53:06,638
directly

5326
04:53:06,638 --> 04:53:08,320
in the demo

5327
04:53:08,320 --> 04:53:10,798
and yeah this lights are more like if

5328
04:53:10,798 --> 04:53:13,040
you want to try it on your own so let me

5329
04:53:13,040 --> 04:53:14,080
just

5330
04:53:14,080 --> 04:53:16,798
jump to this

5331
04:53:16,958 --> 04:53:19,200
hopefully yeah

5332
04:53:19,200 --> 04:53:21,840
this is visible

5333
04:53:27,920 --> 04:53:29,600
yeah because i think if i show it in the

5334
04:53:29,600 --> 04:53:34,718
slides it's not as easily understood as

5335
04:53:34,718 --> 04:53:36,718
as in the demo like when you see live

5336
04:53:36,718 --> 04:53:38,160
moving

5337
04:53:38,160 --> 04:53:39,920
it makes more sense right so the problem

5338
04:53:39,920 --> 04:53:42,160
is um

5339
04:53:42,160 --> 04:53:44,240
with the lack of context isolation the

5340
04:53:44,240 --> 04:53:46,320
exercise is running in the same context

5341
04:53:46,320 --> 04:53:47,680
the javascript is running in the same

5342
04:53:47,680 --> 04:53:50,400
context as the application

5343
04:53:50,400 --> 04:53:51,920
so we can

5344
04:53:51,920 --> 04:53:52,958
we can do

5345
04:53:52,958 --> 04:53:54,400
interesting things with that right so

5346
04:53:54,400 --> 04:53:57,120
i'm just going to

5347
04:53:57,120 --> 04:53:59,200
start the vulnerable application

5348
04:53:59,200 --> 04:54:01,680
and this is like a messaging application

5349
04:54:01,680 --> 04:54:04,958
now it has been simplified uh

5350
04:54:04,958 --> 04:54:06,718
for ease of uh

5351
04:54:06,718 --> 04:54:08,400
debugging and so on

5352
04:54:08,400 --> 04:54:09,920
but in theory this would be like one

5353
04:54:09,920 --> 04:54:11,520
user sending a message to another right

5354
04:54:11,520 --> 04:54:13,360
so you send somebody else a message like

5355
04:54:13,360 --> 04:54:14,718
hey look at this

5356
04:54:14,718 --> 04:54:16,798
now the application linkifies the

5357
04:54:16,798 --> 04:54:18,000
message

5358
04:54:18,000 --> 04:54:19,840
and then this is a

5359
04:54:19,840 --> 04:54:22,000
very risky url right so this is a file

5360
04:54:22,000 --> 04:54:25,040
url from a network location

5361
04:54:25,040 --> 04:54:26,638
this would be like attacker.com in a

5362
04:54:26,638 --> 04:54:28,400
real attack and then you have a java

5363
04:54:28,400 --> 04:54:30,080
extension which will execute without

5364
04:54:30,080 --> 04:54:32,080
warnings in windows right so this would

5365
04:54:32,080 --> 04:54:34,480
be remote code execution if it's opened

5366
04:54:34,480 --> 04:54:36,560
in windows right so when i click on this

5367
04:54:36,560 --> 04:54:38,878
the application says this link is unsafe

5368
04:54:38,878 --> 04:54:42,240
because it is very unsafe right so

5369
04:54:42,240 --> 04:54:43,680
the application is blocking this

5370
04:54:43,680 --> 04:54:46,400
correctly and now the way the

5371
04:54:46,400 --> 04:54:48,798
application is doing this

5372
04:54:48,798 --> 04:54:50,240
is uh

5373
04:54:50,240 --> 04:54:52,560
here it is defining a safe protocols

5374
04:54:52,560 --> 04:54:54,400
array so i'm just going to break down

5375
04:54:54,400 --> 04:54:56,320
the logic of the application in the

5376
04:54:56,320 --> 04:54:58,000
developer tools so that you understand

5377
04:54:58,000 --> 04:54:59,600
how this is working right so we have an

5378
04:54:59,600 --> 04:55:02,400
array position zero is http position one

5379
04:55:02,400 --> 04:55:04,080
is https

5380
04:55:04,080 --> 04:55:05,520
and then there's this check right so

5381
04:55:05,520 --> 04:55:07,760
there's an event listener for clicks and

5382
04:55:07,760 --> 04:55:10,240
then if it is a an ace ref and so on and

5383
04:55:10,240 --> 04:55:13,200
then here there's this check right so

5384
04:55:13,200 --> 04:55:15,120
the save protocols index off different

5385
04:55:15,120 --> 04:55:16,958
than minus one and if it is different

5386
04:55:16,958 --> 04:55:19,600
than minus one so uh it is basically a

5387
04:55:19,600 --> 04:55:21,840
safe protocol then it will be sent to

5388
04:55:21,840 --> 04:55:23,840
shell open external so what shell open

5389
04:55:23,840 --> 04:55:25,680
external does is it's going to send the

5390
04:55:25,680 --> 04:55:28,000
link to the operating system

5391
04:55:28,000 --> 04:55:30,080
so if the link is hdp or sdps the

5392
04:55:30,080 --> 04:55:31,600
operating system will open the browser

5393
04:55:31,600 --> 04:55:34,560
so this is safe i mean http is not very

5394
04:55:34,560 --> 04:55:36,240
safe but at least it will not be called

5395
04:55:36,240 --> 04:55:40,480
execution so it is safe in that sense

5396
04:55:40,480 --> 04:55:42,480
and then if this fails then is when we

5397
04:55:42,480 --> 04:55:43,840
are getting this error message that this

5398
04:55:43,840 --> 04:55:45,760
link is unsafe right so if i do save

5399
04:55:45,760 --> 04:55:47,920
protocols index off

5400
04:55:47,920 --> 04:55:51,440
and i put this here

5401
04:55:52,080 --> 04:55:52,840
and

5402
04:55:52,840 --> 04:55:54,480
i

5403
04:55:54,480 --> 04:55:58,560
i do index of hdps it is position one if

5404
04:55:58,560 --> 04:56:03,520
i do http position zero and if i do file

5405
04:56:03,520 --> 04:56:04,718
um

5406
04:56:04,718 --> 04:56:06,718
so i put here file

5407
04:56:06,718 --> 04:56:08,400
you can see that this is minus one right

5408
04:56:08,400 --> 04:56:11,040
so this is why when i click on this

5409
04:56:11,040 --> 04:56:12,638
the application is sent this link is

5410
04:56:12,638 --> 04:56:16,000
unsafe now since we have uh xss in this

5411
04:56:16,000 --> 04:56:18,080
application what we can do

5412
04:56:18,080 --> 04:56:20,718
is redefine how the index of function

5413
04:56:20,718 --> 04:56:23,920
works right by sending hey look at this

5414
04:56:23,920 --> 04:56:26,000
but at the same time we're sending this

5415
04:56:26,000 --> 04:56:28,480
payload using javascript right

5416
04:56:28,480 --> 04:56:31,200
so we're sending an image

5417
04:56:31,200 --> 04:56:33,120
and then this is redefining how the

5418
04:56:33,120 --> 04:56:34,958
indexof function works in javascript so

5419
04:56:34,958 --> 04:56:36,320
we are inverting the logic of the

5420
04:56:36,320 --> 04:56:37,760
application so i send the message you

5421
04:56:37,760 --> 04:56:40,080
can see the broken image here and now

5422
04:56:40,080 --> 04:56:42,798
if i do save protocols in the excel file

5423
04:56:42,798 --> 04:56:45,120
it's going to be lit right

5424
04:56:45,120 --> 04:56:47,760
if i do http is also lit and if i do

5425
04:56:47,760 --> 04:56:50,560
https it's also lead right so regardless

5426
04:56:50,560 --> 04:56:52,320
of what you try

5427
04:56:52,320 --> 04:56:54,320
it's always going to be lit so this

5428
04:56:54,320 --> 04:56:56,080
alters the flow of the application so

5429
04:56:56,080 --> 04:56:57,840
you will never

5430
04:56:57,840 --> 04:57:00,400
fall into this link is unsafe anymore

5431
04:57:00,400 --> 04:57:02,480
and everything will be open in shell

5432
04:57:02,480 --> 04:57:05,120
open external so now if i go ahead

5433
04:57:05,120 --> 04:57:06,958
and click on this link

5434
04:57:06,958 --> 04:57:09,680
you can see that we are getting the code

5435
04:57:09,680 --> 04:57:11,440
execution right so this is like the

5436
04:57:11,440 --> 04:57:12,480
result of

5437
04:57:12,480 --> 04:57:14,638
of running that java file so we have

5438
04:57:14,638 --> 04:57:16,480
code execution

5439
04:57:16,480 --> 04:57:18,798
without warnings in in windows which is

5440
04:57:18,798 --> 04:57:21,040
uh pretty cool right

5441
04:57:21,040 --> 04:57:22,080
and then

5442
04:57:22,080 --> 04:57:25,440
hopefully i have time for the last demo

5443
04:57:25,440 --> 04:57:26,240
so

5444
04:57:26,240 --> 04:57:27,920
now we're going to see remote code

5445
04:57:27,920 --> 04:57:30,320
execution through ipc so for this one we

5446
04:57:30,320 --> 04:57:32,320
will be using the vulnerable 3

5447
04:57:32,320 --> 04:57:33,680
application

5448
04:57:33,680 --> 04:57:34,400
so

5449
04:57:34,400 --> 04:57:35,360
this

5450
04:57:35,360 --> 04:57:37,360
attack requires several things right so

5451
04:57:37,360 --> 04:57:39,920
we need an xss on the application we

5452
04:57:39,920 --> 04:57:41,920
need the main process which i told you

5453
04:57:41,920 --> 04:57:43,440
is more privileged can do more stuff and

5454
04:57:43,440 --> 04:57:44,400
so on

5455
04:57:44,400 --> 04:57:46,638
to do something dangerous right so so it

5456
04:57:46,638 --> 04:57:49,360
is listening for a get update event

5457
04:57:49,360 --> 04:57:51,280
uh and then it will basically try to get

5458
04:57:51,280 --> 04:57:53,840
the update and then the renderer process

5459
04:57:53,840 --> 04:57:55,840
on preload.js is doing also something

5460
04:57:55,840 --> 04:57:58,240
dangerous which is exposed

5461
04:57:58,240 --> 04:57:59,760
an electron api right so we have

5462
04:57:59,760 --> 04:58:02,400
electron sent and then this ipc render

5463
04:58:02,400 --> 04:58:05,120
send and so right so this is exposing an

5464
04:58:05,120 --> 04:58:06,958
electron api

5465
04:58:06,958 --> 04:58:08,240
to

5466
04:58:08,240 --> 04:58:10,638
the dom right so if we have an xss we

5467
04:58:10,638 --> 04:58:13,040
can now call directly electron sent

5468
04:58:13,040 --> 04:58:14,958
and then we are calling an electron api

5469
04:58:14,958 --> 04:58:17,600
because the application has incorrectly

5470
04:58:17,600 --> 04:58:20,080
or insecurely exposed this

5471
04:58:20,080 --> 04:58:22,638
so what we can do is just send a script

5472
04:58:22,638 --> 04:58:24,798
of electron send get update and then we

5473
04:58:24,798 --> 04:58:27,680
provide a url that has basically a linux

5474
04:58:27,680 --> 04:58:30,400
reversal so that we get code execution

5475
04:58:30,400 --> 04:58:33,600
uh on the on the application right

5476
04:58:33,600 --> 04:58:35,360
other possibilities could be

5477
04:58:35,360 --> 04:58:37,760
electron open in browser

5478
04:58:37,760 --> 04:58:39,920
calling shell open external so this this

5479
04:58:39,920 --> 04:58:41,680
type of vulnerability could happen in

5480
04:58:41,680 --> 04:58:43,920
many different ways right so as long as

5481
04:58:43,920 --> 04:58:46,240
the preload script uh in this case

5482
04:58:46,240 --> 04:58:48,080
preload.js that's something dangerous

5483
04:58:48,080 --> 04:58:50,878
like exposing an electron api like that

5484
04:58:50,878 --> 04:58:52,878
then you could call it from

5485
04:58:52,878 --> 04:58:54,798
javascript directly electronics and

5486
04:58:54,798 --> 04:58:58,400
electron sense this could be other

5487
04:58:58,400 --> 04:58:59,680
potential

5488
04:58:59,680 --> 04:59:00,878
scenarios

5489
04:59:00,878 --> 04:59:03,040
and yeah basically here i'm just going

5490
04:59:03,040 --> 04:59:06,240
to jump to the explanation so here we

5491
04:59:06,240 --> 04:59:08,958
have the main process it's listening for

5492
04:59:08,958 --> 04:59:12,480
get update then it will retrieve the url

5493
04:59:12,480 --> 04:59:13,360
so

5494
04:59:13,360 --> 04:59:15,280
now in javascript everything is event

5495
04:59:15,280 --> 04:59:17,440
based so there's the event for uh will

5496
04:59:17,440 --> 04:59:19,680
download then there's the event for it's

5497
04:59:19,680 --> 04:59:21,360
done and so on right so we'll download

5498
04:59:21,360 --> 04:59:23,200
downloads the file

5499
04:59:23,200 --> 04:59:25,680
eventually it is safe into the downloads

5500
04:59:25,680 --> 04:59:27,120
directory

5501
04:59:27,120 --> 04:59:28,080
and then

5502
04:59:28,080 --> 04:59:29,040
uh

5503
04:59:29,040 --> 04:59:30,958
it's given executable permissions and it

5504
04:59:30,958 --> 04:59:33,120
will just run it because it's an update

5505
04:59:33,120 --> 04:59:36,160
that you're supposed to to run right so

5506
04:59:36,160 --> 04:59:36,958
uh

5507
04:59:36,958 --> 04:59:38,480
yeah and then the

5508
04:59:38,480 --> 04:59:40,580
so this is the the script just the

5509
04:59:40,580 --> 04:59:42,000
[Music]

5510
04:59:42,000 --> 04:59:44,878
electron sent of this and here we have

5511
04:59:44,878 --> 04:59:48,000
like a uh linux like uh you know one

5512
04:59:48,000 --> 04:59:51,120
liner so it's basically removing a

5513
04:59:51,120 --> 04:59:52,560
temporary file

5514
04:59:52,560 --> 04:59:54,638
then it creates an input output file on

5515
04:59:54,638 --> 04:59:56,878
slash tmpf which is normally a directory

5516
04:59:56,878 --> 04:59:59,760
where the server or the in this case the

5517
04:59:59,760 --> 05:00:01,680
desktop application will probably have

5518
05:00:01,680 --> 05:00:02,958
write permissions

5519
05:00:02,958 --> 05:00:04,638
and then you just cut the file pipe it

5520
05:00:04,638 --> 05:00:07,200
to sh with interactive mode you want to

5521
05:00:07,200 --> 05:00:09,120
redirect error messages to standard

5522
05:00:09,120 --> 05:00:11,280
output so you can see that and then you

5523
05:00:11,280 --> 05:00:13,040
pipe this using netcat to the

5524
05:00:13,040 --> 05:00:15,200
attacker.com

5525
05:00:15,200 --> 05:00:17,200
port444 which is the official port for

5526
05:00:17,200 --> 05:00:19,360
shelves and then you just send this to

5527
05:00:19,360 --> 05:00:21,840
uh to the temporary file right so and

5528
05:00:21,840 --> 05:00:24,320
then on the netcat um window you will

5529
05:00:24,320 --> 05:00:26,400
get the shell so let me maybe just jump

5530
05:00:26,400 --> 05:00:28,400
to the demo and then when you use

5531
05:00:28,400 --> 05:00:30,480
console.log it will show on the terminal

5532
05:00:30,480 --> 05:00:31,600
where you're running the application

5533
05:00:31,600 --> 05:00:33,520
from but i'll show this on the demo now

5534
05:00:33,520 --> 05:00:35,520
and then on the netcat screen you should

5535
05:00:35,520 --> 05:00:37,680
be able to you know get the shell and

5536
05:00:37,680 --> 05:00:38,480
run

5537
05:00:38,480 --> 05:00:41,760
all the commands and stuff so let's just

5538
05:00:41,760 --> 05:00:43,360
jump to the demo

5539
05:00:43,360 --> 05:00:45,440
so i'm just running the vulnerable three

5540
05:00:45,440 --> 05:00:48,079
application

5541
05:00:48,718 --> 05:00:50,878
make it a bit bigger

5542
05:00:50,878 --> 05:00:53,440
and

5543
05:00:53,440 --> 05:00:54,560
now

5544
05:00:54,560 --> 05:00:57,200
i'm just going to send this

5545
05:00:57,200 --> 05:00:59,440
linux reversal

5546
05:00:59,440 --> 05:01:01,680
so

5547
05:01:01,760 --> 05:01:03,440
you would basically send this to the

5548
05:01:03,440 --> 05:01:05,760
victim user right so in this case so we

5549
05:01:05,760 --> 05:01:06,718
don't have infrastructure in the

5550
05:01:06,718 --> 05:01:08,480
previous year and now before i click on

5551
05:01:08,480 --> 05:01:10,480
this i need to make sure i'm running

5552
05:01:10,480 --> 05:01:12,638
netcat right so i'm just running netcat

5553
05:01:12,638 --> 05:01:13,680
here

5554
05:01:13,680 --> 05:01:17,840
so now if i click on this

5555
05:01:18,160 --> 05:01:20,080
and now i go in here you can see that i

5556
05:01:20,080 --> 05:01:21,200
received

5557
05:01:21,200 --> 05:01:23,840
a connection so i can run here like any

5558
05:01:23,840 --> 05:01:25,840
commands i want so

5559
05:01:25,840 --> 05:01:28,560
yeah cutency password

5560
05:01:28,560 --> 05:01:30,480
let's see

5561
05:01:30,480 --> 05:01:33,200
if i can type

5562
05:01:33,920 --> 05:01:36,320
and so on right so what happened here

5563
05:01:36,320 --> 05:01:37,200
so

5564
05:01:37,200 --> 05:01:39,040
um if we look at the source code right

5565
05:01:39,040 --> 05:01:40,878
so you can see here like main.js is

5566
05:01:40,878 --> 05:01:42,798
complete so i can go here to the source

5567
05:01:42,798 --> 05:01:44,638
code main.js

5568
05:01:44,638 --> 05:01:48,239
so i can search for complete

5569
05:01:48,560 --> 05:01:50,560
main.js is complete this is what's

5570
05:01:50,560 --> 05:01:52,400
happening before

5571
05:01:52,400 --> 05:01:53,520
right so

5572
05:01:53,520 --> 05:01:55,360
main.js is complete and then here you

5573
05:01:55,360 --> 05:01:58,560
have like getupdate is called with this

5574
05:01:58,560 --> 05:02:01,520
url this is the downloads directory

5575
05:02:01,520 --> 05:02:03,680
so it gets the url for the update

5576
05:02:03,680 --> 05:02:05,440
it downloads it and then you have like

5577
05:02:05,440 --> 05:02:07,120
the receive bytes and eventually

5578
05:02:07,120 --> 05:02:09,520
download successful running updates so

5579
05:02:09,520 --> 05:02:12,160
i can just jump for

5580
05:02:12,160 --> 05:02:15,520
the running update for example

5581
05:02:15,520 --> 05:02:17,680
and you can see it here

5582
05:02:17,680 --> 05:02:18,560
where

5583
05:02:18,560 --> 05:02:20,560
like permissions have been assigned and

5584
05:02:20,560 --> 05:02:23,200
it runs the update

5585
05:02:23,200 --> 05:02:24,840
and so

5586
05:02:24,840 --> 05:02:28,160
on yeah i have no idea how i'm doing on

5587
05:02:28,160 --> 05:02:30,400
time but i believe we have some time for

5588
05:02:30,400 --> 05:02:32,400
questions so

5589
05:02:32,400 --> 05:02:33,920
again if anybody's interested on the

5590
05:02:33,920 --> 05:02:36,878
free stuff there's uh the slides here

5591
05:02:36,878 --> 05:02:39,520
the vulnerable apps to practice with and

5592
05:02:39,520 --> 05:02:41,840
this also are recording

5593
05:02:41,840 --> 05:02:44,000
and if anybody is considering the paid

5594
05:02:44,000 --> 05:02:46,480
stuff there's a june 50 discount that

5595
05:02:46,480 --> 05:02:48,480
you can use now for fifty percent of

5596
05:02:48,480 --> 05:02:50,798
anything on the store seven secure.com

5597
05:02:50,798 --> 05:02:52,400
if anybody was interested in that and

5598
05:02:52,400 --> 05:02:54,160
with that we have time for questions i

5599
05:02:54,160 --> 05:02:55,280
believe

5600
05:02:55,280 --> 05:02:56,480
yeah

5601
05:02:56,480 --> 05:02:58,400
question questions oh that was hot

5602
05:02:58,400 --> 05:02:59,440
that was loud

5603
05:02:59,440 --> 05:03:01,760
questions anyone

5604
05:03:01,760 --> 05:03:04,878
no yeah you have questions come on

5605
05:03:04,878 --> 05:03:07,878
someone

5606
05:03:08,160 --> 05:03:11,520
no of course you do

5607
05:03:11,680 --> 05:03:14,878
so yeah good

5608
05:03:19,280 --> 05:03:21,280
the most common would be

5609
05:03:21,280 --> 05:03:23,520
the lack of context isolation

5610
05:03:23,520 --> 05:03:27,280
so electron in 2019 changed the default

5611
05:03:27,280 --> 05:03:30,638
of node integration to false by default

5612
05:03:30,638 --> 05:03:33,280
so this was turned so until 2019 it was

5613
05:03:33,280 --> 05:03:35,280
like on by default right so any xss

5614
05:03:35,280 --> 05:03:37,280
would be directly code execution unless

5615
05:03:37,280 --> 05:03:39,360
the developer manually change this and

5616
05:03:39,360 --> 05:03:40,878
then they change the default so this is

5617
05:03:40,878 --> 05:03:42,320
now less common

5618
05:03:42,320 --> 05:03:43,920
but it will still be common in old

5619
05:03:43,920 --> 05:03:45,520
electron applications that have not been

5620
05:03:45,520 --> 05:03:47,680
updated but the lack of context

5621
05:03:47,680 --> 05:03:49,920
isolation is still rampant because it's

5622
05:03:49,920 --> 05:03:52,320
the default right so

5623
05:03:52,320 --> 05:03:54,798
and another technique that i didn't show

5624
05:03:54,798 --> 05:03:57,120
is when there's no context isolation and

5625
05:03:57,120 --> 05:03:58,638
this is probably how masato got

5626
05:03:58,638 --> 05:04:00,560
microsoft teams

5627
05:04:00,560 --> 05:04:02,798
well another thing you can do is send an

5628
05:04:02,798 --> 05:04:05,120
ipc to electron itself with this hackery

5629
05:04:05,120 --> 05:04:06,320
stuff like

5630
05:04:06,320 --> 05:04:09,440
like you show you saw how i uh redefined

5631
05:04:09,440 --> 05:04:10,958
the indexof function to attack the

5632
05:04:10,958 --> 05:04:12,400
preload script right

5633
05:04:12,400 --> 05:04:14,480
so that is one of the techniques that

5634
05:04:14,480 --> 05:04:15,440
that

5635
05:04:15,440 --> 05:04:17,120
that you can use but another technique

5636
05:04:17,120 --> 05:04:19,120
that you can use is to mess with the

5637
05:04:19,120 --> 05:04:21,600
javascript coding electron itself

5638
05:04:21,600 --> 05:04:24,160
right so you can like do some hackery

5639
05:04:24,160 --> 05:04:25,280
stuff

5640
05:04:25,280 --> 05:04:27,920
and redefine like some bind and other

5641
05:04:27,920 --> 05:04:29,360
javascript methods and then you can send

5642
05:04:29,360 --> 05:04:31,040
an ipc to electron itself but that's

5643
05:04:31,040 --> 05:04:32,320
that's more complicated we explained

5644
05:04:32,320 --> 05:04:34,638
that uh in the course itself but but

5645
05:04:34,638 --> 05:04:36,958
yeah that is probably how masato got

5646
05:04:36,958 --> 05:04:38,400
microsoft teams because it's the easiest

5647
05:04:38,400 --> 05:04:40,240
thing to try right so the lack of

5648
05:04:40,240 --> 05:04:42,798
context isolation if you see it that

5649
05:04:42,798 --> 05:04:45,600
should be a remote code execution given

5650
05:04:45,600 --> 05:04:47,360
enough time you know until you get like

5651
05:04:47,360 --> 05:04:49,600
the the proof of concept working

5652
05:04:49,600 --> 05:04:51,280
which requires a little bit of skill but

5653
05:04:51,280 --> 05:04:53,440
it is possible because you can always

5654
05:04:53,440 --> 05:04:55,120
mess with the code the javascript code

5655
05:04:55,120 --> 05:04:57,120
of electron itself right so lack of

5656
05:04:57,120 --> 05:04:59,600
context isolation i would say would be

5657
05:04:59,600 --> 05:05:02,560
the most common issue and

5658
05:05:02,560 --> 05:05:04,878
definitely can be always code execution

5659
05:05:04,878 --> 05:05:07,840
if if you know you know how to attack it

5660
05:05:07,840 --> 05:05:10,240
anyone else

5661
05:05:10,240 --> 05:05:12,638
then i have a question so how common is

5662
05:05:12,638 --> 05:05:14,878
that is it common that people implement

5663
05:05:14,878 --> 05:05:17,760
on purifier in their apps as well

5664
05:05:17,760 --> 05:05:19,280
i think they have like a million

5665
05:05:19,280 --> 05:05:21,920
something downloads right yeah

5666
05:05:21,920 --> 05:05:24,400
but would you say that is common like

5667
05:05:24,400 --> 05:05:26,480
now maybe in web applications but not in

5668
05:05:26,480 --> 05:05:29,520
electron in electron this would be rare

5669
05:05:29,520 --> 05:05:31,200
yeah but in web applications sometimes

5670
05:05:31,200 --> 05:05:33,920
we see it but not you know not too much

5671
05:05:33,920 --> 05:05:35,360
uh it could it should be using more

5672
05:05:35,360 --> 05:05:36,878
often

5673
05:05:36,878 --> 05:05:38,798
at nooncon berlin the

5674
05:05:38,798 --> 05:05:40,798
freddy was talking about

5675
05:05:40,798 --> 05:05:42,480
that they are planning to implement a

5676
05:05:42,480 --> 05:05:44,160
sanitizer in the browser itself so

5677
05:05:44,160 --> 05:05:46,400
there's an rfc going on about this

5678
05:05:46,400 --> 05:05:48,160
so kind of trying to do like the dom

5679
05:05:48,160 --> 05:05:50,320
purify thing at the browser level

5680
05:05:50,320 --> 05:05:51,840
so when they do that

5681
05:05:51,840 --> 05:05:53,440
uh that's already like a working

5682
05:05:53,440 --> 05:05:55,680
progress implementation then this will

5683
05:05:55,680 --> 05:05:57,760
also be available in electron apps

5684
05:05:57,760 --> 05:05:59,760
because electron is basically running

5685
05:05:59,760 --> 05:06:02,638
chrome right so uh whatever they do in

5686
05:06:02,638 --> 05:06:04,878
the chrome browser will eventually like

5687
05:06:04,878 --> 05:06:07,600
make it to uh to electron as well

5688
05:06:07,600 --> 05:06:08,718
so

5689
05:06:08,718 --> 05:06:10,798
so yeah so then from an electron

5690
05:06:10,798 --> 05:06:12,240
application you could use the browser

5691
05:06:12,240 --> 05:06:15,360
sanitizer as well as dom purify right so

5692
05:06:15,360 --> 05:06:16,638
the purifier would be an external

5693
05:06:16,638 --> 05:06:19,680
dependency but uh but yeah this is

5694
05:06:19,680 --> 05:06:22,320
it's already an rfcn there's already um

5695
05:06:22,320 --> 05:06:24,320
a work in progress implementation about

5696
05:06:24,320 --> 05:06:25,520
it

5697
05:06:25,520 --> 05:06:28,160
so anyone who dares to ask a question

5698
05:06:28,160 --> 05:06:29,760
it's very scary

5699
05:06:29,760 --> 05:06:31,200
no

5700
05:06:31,200 --> 05:06:32,080
no

5701
05:06:32,080 --> 05:06:33,760
anyone

5702
05:06:33,760 --> 05:06:35,760
oh you can you can yeah i guess you are

5703
05:06:35,760 --> 05:06:37,760
open for questions later as well if

5704
05:06:37,760 --> 05:06:39,680
you're shy

5705
05:06:39,680 --> 05:06:41,760
okay but without further ado thank you

5706
05:06:41,760 --> 05:06:44,798
ape for the presentation

5707
05:06:50,718 --> 05:06:53,440
and uh we will yeah as you already

5708
05:06:53,440 --> 05:06:55,280
figured out we're a bit late or behind

5709
05:06:55,280 --> 05:06:58,240
the schedule as usual so uh but we are

5710
05:06:58,240 --> 05:06:59,520
we're actually

5711
05:06:59,520 --> 05:07:01,520
getting up to time now so i'm gonna

5712
05:07:01,520 --> 05:07:04,160
don't leave we're gonna do the

5713
05:07:04,160 --> 05:07:07,200
the one uh the uh mickey falcon stalker

5714
05:07:07,200 --> 05:07:08,718
how i got remote gel on your helium

5715
05:07:08,718 --> 05:07:11,840
crypto miner so be seated and then we

5716
05:07:11,840 --> 05:07:13,760
will have a short break for

5717
05:07:13,760 --> 05:07:15,120
some coffee

5718
05:07:15,120 --> 05:07:16,718
sounds good

5719
05:07:16,718 --> 05:07:18,080
cool

5720
05:07:18,080 --> 05:07:21,560
then we yep

5721
05:07:22,410 --> 05:07:30,668
[Music]

5722
05:18:08,480 --> 05:18:10,580
okay

5723
05:18:10,580 --> 05:18:13,759
[Music]

5724
05:19:00,160 --> 05:19:02,240
okay now we're ready

5725
05:19:02,240 --> 05:19:03,680
technology

5726
05:19:03,680 --> 05:19:05,680

several tech companies

5737
05:19:36,080 --> 05:19:39,200
on software development i.t security it

5738
05:19:39,200 --> 05:19:42,400
architecture those kind of things

5739
05:19:42,400 --> 05:19:43,680
i'm also

5740
05:19:43,680 --> 05:19:45,280
amateur radio

5741
05:19:45,280 --> 05:19:46,560
licensee

5742
05:19:46,560 --> 05:19:49,200
i love radio stuff which you will notice

5743
05:19:49,200 --> 05:19:51,120
here

5744
05:19:51,120 --> 05:19:54,000
i'm a board member of the wes gothenburg

5745
05:19:54,000 --> 05:19:55,760
chapter

5746
05:19:55,760 --> 05:19:58,958
some open source contributions

5747
05:19:58,958 --> 05:20:02,638
and i have programmed two satellites and

5748
05:20:02,638 --> 05:20:05,920
i love listening to them

5749
05:20:08,958 --> 05:20:13,120
so enough about me how about you uh and

5750
05:20:13,120 --> 05:20:17,120
specifically to this uh presentations

5751
05:20:17,120 --> 05:20:19,280
how many could you please raise a hand

5752
05:20:19,280 --> 05:20:22,958
if you heard about laura wan

5753
05:20:22,958 --> 05:20:24,480
all right i would

5754
05:20:24,480 --> 05:20:28,000
guess maybe 40 or something

5755
05:20:28,000 --> 05:20:29,920
and

5756
05:20:29,920 --> 05:20:31,120
how

5757
05:20:31,120 --> 05:20:35,120
many have heard of the helium blockchain

5758
05:20:35,120 --> 05:20:38,240
much fewer i would say maybe 10

5759
05:20:38,240 --> 05:20:40,000
and i'm not sure that if there's much

5760
05:20:40,000 --> 05:20:41,920
overlap what i've found is that a lot of

5761
05:20:41,920 --> 05:20:43,520
people work with the helium blockchain

5762
05:20:43,520 --> 05:20:45,040
but they don't know what it actually

5763
05:20:45,040 --> 05:20:45,920
does

5764
05:20:45,920 --> 05:20:47,040
uh

5765
05:20:47,040 --> 05:20:49,920
which to me is quite interesting but

5766
05:20:49,920 --> 05:20:54,240
always that uh all ways that we can get

5767
05:20:54,240 --> 05:20:56,638
new people into technology is good even

5768
05:20:56,638 --> 05:21:00,079
if it's through crypto

5769
05:21:02,558 --> 05:21:05,200
so for those about 60 who haven't heard

5770
05:21:05,200 --> 05:21:06,718
about lorawan

5771
05:21:06,718 --> 05:21:09,600
it's a an iot network

5772
05:21:09,600 --> 05:21:11,600
and compared to

5773
05:21:11,600 --> 05:21:12,400
the

5774
05:21:12,400 --> 05:21:14,558
normal cellular networks that we use

5775
05:21:14,558 --> 05:21:16,480
every day with our phones

5776
05:21:16,480 --> 05:21:19,120
it's much more low power

5777
05:21:19,120 --> 05:21:21,520
my phone lasts maybe throughout the day

5778
05:21:21,520 --> 05:21:25,600
if i'm if i'm lucky uh those devices are

5779
05:21:25,600 --> 05:21:28,240
maybe a little bit larger than a phone

5780
05:21:28,240 --> 05:21:31,040
but not much uh and they can have

5781
05:21:31,040 --> 05:21:34,400
between five and ten years battery life

5782
05:21:34,400 --> 05:21:36,958
so it's a big difference and if you want

5783
05:21:36,958 --> 05:21:39,840
for example put a gps tracker on one of

5784
05:21:39,840 --> 05:21:42,000
those big containers that go on the

5785
05:21:42,000 --> 05:21:43,680
chips

5786
05:21:43,680 --> 05:21:45,520
you don't want to go out and charge them

5787
05:21:45,520 --> 05:21:48,240
every day or even every year it's not

5788
05:21:48,240 --> 05:21:50,718
possible

5789
05:21:51,680 --> 05:21:53,040
and

5790
05:21:53,040 --> 05:21:55,520
the network uses gateways which has a

5791
05:21:55,520 --> 05:21:58,798
similar role to base stations in a cell

5792
05:21:58,798 --> 05:22:00,480
network

5793
05:22:00,480 --> 05:22:03,520
so most people have seen those uh

5794
05:22:03,520 --> 05:22:05,440
on roofs and things

5795
05:22:05,440 --> 05:22:08,480
with normal uh cell cellular

5796
05:22:08,480 --> 05:22:10,320
and there are similar

5797
05:22:10,320 --> 05:22:14,160
and i'll show you i have two with me

5798
05:22:15,520 --> 05:22:17,840
it's also more low cost

5799
05:22:17,840 --> 05:22:20,000
in terms of hardware a phone well you

5800
05:22:20,000 --> 05:22:21,680
can buy

5801
05:22:21,680 --> 05:22:24,798
an android phone pretty cheaply today

5802
05:22:24,798 --> 05:22:25,680
but

5803
05:22:25,680 --> 05:22:28,958
these devices cost from maybe 35 euros

5804
05:22:28,958 --> 05:22:32,080
in single quantity and if you buy 100

5805
05:22:32,080 --> 05:22:33,840
000 of them of course you will get a

5806
05:22:33,840 --> 05:22:35,520
discount

5807
05:22:35,520 --> 05:22:38,480
and the subscriptions are about half a

5808
05:22:38,480 --> 05:22:41,600
euro per month sometimes lower

5809
05:22:41,600 --> 05:22:42,638
so

5810
05:22:42,638 --> 05:22:45,520
much cheaper to use this kind of network

5811
05:22:45,520 --> 05:22:48,878
than to use the cellular networks

5812
05:22:48,878 --> 05:22:51,600
and one reason that it can be cheaper is

5813
05:22:51,600 --> 05:22:54,878
that it's much longer range so

5814
05:22:54,878 --> 05:22:57,120
you can get the same kind of coverage

5815
05:22:57,120 --> 05:23:00,480
with fewer gateways

5816
05:23:04,400 --> 05:23:06,798
building a new communications network

5817
05:23:06,798 --> 05:23:10,638
even if it's so cool as laura won it

5818
05:23:10,638 --> 05:23:12,878
takes a lot of money and the problem is

5819
05:23:12,878 --> 05:23:15,040
that nobody's going to spend a lot of

5820
05:23:15,040 --> 05:23:17,920
money putting out all these gateways

5821
05:23:17,920 --> 05:23:21,120
before there's subscription revenue

5822
05:23:21,120 --> 05:23:23,280
and of course no one in their right mind

5823
05:23:23,280 --> 05:23:25,200
would buy a subscription to a network

5824
05:23:25,200 --> 05:23:28,480
that doesn't have garbage yet

5825
05:23:28,480 --> 05:23:29,200
so

5826
05:23:29,200 --> 05:23:31,440
the problem is illustrated by this curve

5827
05:23:31,440 --> 05:23:33,600
that it takes a lot of money until it

5828
05:23:33,600 --> 05:23:35,440
lifts off

5829
05:23:35,440 --> 05:23:37,600
and that's where the helium blockchain

5830
05:23:37,600 --> 05:23:40,920
comes in

5831
05:23:41,920 --> 05:23:45,040
what the helium blockchain does is that

5832
05:23:45,040 --> 05:23:47,360
yeah we know there's not much traffic

5833
05:23:47,360 --> 05:23:48,160
yet

5834
05:23:48,160 --> 05:23:50,878
so we will pay people in our own

5835
05:23:50,878 --> 05:23:52,878
cryptocurrency

5836
05:23:52,878 --> 05:23:55,520
for just providing coverage

5837
05:23:55,520 --> 05:23:58,240
so a gateway will send out a ping all

5838
05:23:58,240 --> 05:23:59,920
the

5839
05:23:59,920 --> 05:24:01,840
other gateways that hear that ping they

5840
05:24:01,840 --> 05:24:03,360
register that

5841
05:24:03,360 --> 05:24:06,080
and by that you know that in this

5842
05:24:06,080 --> 05:24:09,120
geographical area you have coverage

5843
05:24:09,120 --> 05:24:11,040
because we could hear from here to here

5844
05:24:11,040 --> 05:24:13,200
then a device being somewhere here will

5845
05:24:13,200 --> 05:24:15,840
probably work

5846
05:24:15,840 --> 05:24:18,878
and all gateway owners uh

5847
05:24:18,878 --> 05:24:19,840
share

5848
05:24:19,840 --> 05:24:23,520
the distribution of coins

5849
05:24:23,520 --> 05:24:25,760
this incentivizes people to buy the

5850
05:24:25,760 --> 05:24:28,000
hardware because

5851
05:24:28,000 --> 05:24:29,600
they are

5852
05:24:29,600 --> 05:24:32,558
not that expensive but a bit and it

5853
05:24:32,558 --> 05:24:34,240
incentivizes people to find good

5854
05:24:34,240 --> 05:24:36,000
locations

5855
05:24:36,000 --> 05:24:38,798
the higher up the more you can

5856
05:24:38,798 --> 05:24:41,280
get others to see your and it's also

5857
05:24:41,280 --> 05:24:44,239
better for coverage

5858
05:24:45,200 --> 05:24:48,080
so does this really work i mean

5859
05:24:48,080 --> 05:24:50,718
does any blockchain really work

5860
05:24:50,718 --> 05:24:53,760
uh this is what happened the first 18

5861
05:24:53,760 --> 05:24:56,079
months

5862
05:24:57,040 --> 05:24:59,280
so we have oops

5863
05:24:59,280 --> 05:25:02,480
we have from the summer of 2019 to

5864
05:25:02,480 --> 05:25:05,440
january 1st 2021 so one and a half year

5865
05:25:05,440 --> 05:25:07,680
ago

5866
05:25:08,480 --> 05:25:10,718
what did they reach about

5867
05:25:10,718 --> 05:25:12,638
16 000

5868
05:25:12,638 --> 05:25:15,520
base stations or gateways globally not

5869
05:25:15,520 --> 05:25:17,600
really that impressive

5870
05:25:17,600 --> 05:25:19,520
but then something happens

5871
05:25:19,520 --> 05:25:20,558
so

5872
05:25:20,558 --> 05:25:24,240
this curve shows the last three years

5873
05:25:24,240 --> 05:25:26,240
and the curve so the curve i just show

5874
05:25:26,240 --> 05:25:27,760
you is half this

5875
05:25:27,760 --> 05:25:30,558
until about here

5876
05:25:30,558 --> 05:25:34,160
and now there are more than 800 000

5877
05:25:34,160 --> 05:25:36,798
gateways in the world

5878
05:25:36,798 --> 05:25:39,440
and it's all been paid for by other

5879
05:25:39,440 --> 05:25:43,760
people than the helium company

5880
05:25:43,760 --> 05:25:47,360
so that's pretty impressive

5881
05:25:47,360 --> 05:25:49,760
and the global coverage map today looks

5882
05:25:49,760 --> 05:25:51,440
something like this

5883
05:25:51,440 --> 05:25:53,920
which is also from building from scratch

5884
05:25:53,920 --> 05:25:55,840
three years to have a global coverage

5885
05:25:55,840 --> 05:25:57,760
like this

5886
05:25:57,760 --> 05:26:01,557
it's never been done before

5887
05:26:03,120 --> 05:26:07,600
and let's see if i can get this running

5888
05:26:08,798 --> 05:26:11,280
so this is stockholm i think

5889
05:26:11,280 --> 05:26:12,160
i have a

5890
05:26:12,160 --> 05:26:14,480
little trouble seeing from here so this

5891
05:26:14,480 --> 05:26:16,638
is how the network has grown

5892
05:26:16,638 --> 05:26:20,480
the last year or so

5893
05:26:20,558 --> 05:26:24,040
then we have berlin

5894
05:26:28,000 --> 05:26:30,400
and for being a crowd

5895
05:26:30,400 --> 05:26:32,400
sourced network

5896
05:26:32,400 --> 05:26:34,958
i think this is super cool here we have

5897
05:26:34,958 --> 05:26:37,359
london

5898
05:26:38,798 --> 05:26:40,320
but it's not

5899
05:26:40,320 --> 05:26:46,080
only in the large cities it's also in uh

5900
05:26:46,080 --> 05:26:47,120
usa

5901
05:26:47,120 --> 05:26:49,040
that's where it started so we have new

5902
05:26:49,040 --> 05:26:51,760
york and we can see manhattan was

5903
05:26:51,760 --> 05:26:54,558
covered pretty quickly but also

5904
05:26:54,558 --> 05:26:57,040
outside the city we have a lot of

5905
05:26:57,040 --> 05:26:59,440
coverage

5906
05:27:05,280 --> 05:27:08,240
the helium blockchain is currently about

5907
05:27:08,240 --> 05:27:10,798
number 50 it goes a bit up and down

5908
05:27:10,798 --> 05:27:11,680
every

5909
05:27:11,680 --> 05:27:14,080
minute

5910
05:27:14,320 --> 05:27:15,120
and

5911
05:27:15,120 --> 05:27:17,840
the latest market cap was around 1

5912
05:27:17,840 --> 05:27:20,878
billion before the the most recent

5913
05:27:20,878 --> 05:27:23,840
crypto crash it was about 3 billion

5914
05:27:23,840 --> 05:27:25,120
dollars

5915
05:27:25,120 --> 05:27:25,920
so

5916
05:27:25,920 --> 05:27:28,718
there's quite a lot of

5917
05:27:28,718 --> 05:27:31,040
value created for some sort of

5918
05:27:31,040 --> 05:27:34,080
definition of value

5919
05:27:34,080 --> 05:27:36,798
so enough with the background

5920
05:27:36,798 --> 05:27:39,280
the helium gateways or base stations

5921
05:27:39,280 --> 05:27:40,878
they can look

5922
05:27:40,878 --> 05:27:42,160
like this

5923
05:27:42,160 --> 05:27:44,320
this is an indoor variant of course it

5924
05:27:44,320 --> 05:27:46,638
it has a lid but it doesn't look as cool

5925
05:27:46,638 --> 05:27:49,040
without with the lid so i just removed

5926
05:27:49,040 --> 05:27:52,798
it uh so you put this this costs roughly

5927
05:27:52,798 --> 05:27:53,558
about

5928
05:27:53,558 --> 05:27:57,440
500 euros

5929
05:27:58,320 --> 05:28:02,000
and then we have the outdoor version

5930
05:28:02,000 --> 05:28:05,878
with a beefier antenna

5931
05:28:07,840 --> 05:28:10,480
and the inside

5932
05:28:10,480 --> 05:28:13,680
looks pretty nice as well

5933
05:28:16,878 --> 05:28:18,080
and

5934
05:28:18,080 --> 05:28:18,958
since

5935
05:28:18,958 --> 05:28:21,040
these

5936
05:28:21,040 --> 05:28:23,520
generate the blockchain value based on

5937
05:28:23,520 --> 05:28:24,638
coverage

5938
05:28:24,638 --> 05:28:27,520
they don't do a lot of computation

5939
05:28:27,520 --> 05:28:30,480
there's a raspberry pi compute module in

5940
05:28:30,480 --> 05:28:33,360
it and then there's some other things so

5941
05:28:33,360 --> 05:28:36,240
the total consumption is about

5942
05:28:36,240 --> 05:28:40,000
5 to 15 watts so one to three times a

5943
05:28:40,000 --> 05:28:43,280
normal raspberry pi

5944
05:28:43,280 --> 05:28:45,840
and until just

5945
05:28:45,840 --> 05:28:48,558
three weeks ago all these were full

5946
05:28:48,558 --> 05:28:51,040
blockchain nodes

5947
05:28:51,040 --> 05:28:52,400
but they

5948
05:28:52,400 --> 05:28:54,558
they realized that doesn't really scale

5949
05:28:54,558 --> 05:28:57,760
so now the blockchain has grown so it's

5950
05:28:57,760 --> 05:29:01,040
no longer on these nodes but

5951
05:29:01,040 --> 05:29:03,760
every gateway is registered in the

5952
05:29:03,760 --> 05:29:06,320
blockchain

5953
05:29:07,040 --> 05:29:08,798
and to be able to manufacture one of

5954
05:29:08,798 --> 05:29:10,480
those you need to follow

5955
05:29:10,480 --> 05:29:12,240
quite stringent

5956
05:29:12,240 --> 05:29:14,160
requirements

5957
05:29:14,160 --> 05:29:17,760
when it comes to security

5958
05:29:17,760 --> 05:29:21,440
and this is where the fun starts

5959
05:29:22,080 --> 05:29:25,280
i've highlighted a part so this is cut

5960
05:29:25,280 --> 05:29:28,080
directly from github where they describe

5961
05:29:28,080 --> 05:29:30,080
these other requirements

5962
05:29:30,080 --> 05:29:33,360
so it they say it needs to be reasonably

5963
05:29:33,360 --> 05:29:36,958
secure and resistant for tampering

5964
05:29:36,958 --> 05:29:38,718
that's a challenge

5965
05:29:38,718 --> 05:29:41,520
i accept it

5966
05:29:42,958 --> 05:29:44,558
so i started

5967
05:29:44,558 --> 05:29:47,520
just using nmap to see what's going on

5968
05:29:47,520 --> 05:29:48,878
here

5969
05:29:48,878 --> 05:29:51,600
and i noticed we have uh

5970
05:29:51,600 --> 05:29:52,878
port 80

5971
05:29:52,878 --> 05:29:56,718
port 22 22 2.

5972
05:29:56,718 --> 05:29:59,680
the other parts i know i used for the

5973
05:29:59,680 --> 05:30:01,680
blockchain network so i wasn't that

5974
05:30:01,680 --> 05:30:04,638
interested but the first two all right

5975
05:30:04,638 --> 05:30:07,360
and the one with all twos

5976
05:30:07,360 --> 05:30:10,718
my guess was something with ssh

5977
05:30:10,718 --> 05:30:13,760
so i just tried to log into it

5978
05:30:13,760 --> 05:30:15,920
and it said denied

5979
05:30:15,920 --> 05:30:19,680
so then i knew we have ssh server

5980
05:30:19,680 --> 05:30:22,160
and it seems to only support public key

5981
05:30:22,160 --> 05:30:25,280
authentication so no password okay

5982
05:30:25,280 --> 05:30:27,520
it would have been really nice if it did

5983
05:30:27,520 --> 05:30:29,520
and i could log in but it doesn't seem

5984
05:30:29,520 --> 05:30:31,680
to

5985
05:30:33,680 --> 05:30:35,200
and

5986
05:30:35,200 --> 05:30:37,520
i checked the version

5987
05:30:37,520 --> 05:30:41,360
so it's a fairly recent open ssh

5988
05:30:41,360 --> 05:30:43,440
and i checked the

5989
05:30:43,440 --> 05:30:44,878
national

5990
05:30:44,878 --> 05:30:47,120
vulnerability database

5991
05:30:47,120 --> 05:30:48,558
it shows some

5992
05:30:48,558 --> 05:30:50,400
some vulnerabilities but nothing very

5993
05:30:50,400 --> 05:30:53,400
easy

5994
05:30:54,080 --> 05:30:58,638
so i decided to put ssh on hold

5995
05:31:00,160 --> 05:31:01,360
on

5996
05:31:01,360 --> 05:31:03,280
port 80 i

5997
05:31:03,280 --> 05:31:06,558
used a tool called crawl box

5998
05:31:06,558 --> 05:31:09,120
there are lots of tools like this that

5999
05:31:09,120 --> 05:31:10,000
can

6000
05:31:10,000 --> 05:31:10,798
uh

6001
05:31:10,798 --> 05:31:12,718
just try

6002
05:31:12,718 --> 05:31:15,920
commonly used urls or endpoints

6003
05:31:15,920 --> 05:31:18,000
and it found something

6004
05:31:18,000 --> 05:31:20,798
on an address called scheduler

6005
05:31:20,798 --> 05:31:23,840
that could be interesting

6006
05:31:26,240 --> 05:31:29,120
i just accessed that endpoint and it had

6007
05:31:29,120 --> 05:31:30,878
some info

6008
05:31:30,878 --> 05:31:34,798
allowed hosts anything and it's running

6009
05:31:34,798 --> 05:31:36,558
sounds promising

6010
05:31:36,558 --> 05:31:39,920
so what is this service

6011
05:31:40,558 --> 05:31:43,440
i just google what i found and it seems

6012
05:31:43,440 --> 05:31:45,920
to have something to do with

6013
05:31:45,920 --> 05:31:48,878
something called flask ap scheduler so

6014
05:31:48,878 --> 05:31:52,160
flask is a web framework for python and

6015
05:31:52,160 --> 05:31:54,400
ap scheduler is advanced python

6016
05:31:54,400 --> 05:31:55,920
scheduler

6017
05:31:55,920 --> 05:31:58,878
okay schedulers usually run things and i

6018
05:31:58,878 --> 05:32:01,680
want to run things

6019
05:32:03,440 --> 05:32:07,040
and the flask ap scheduler has an api

6020
05:32:07,040 --> 05:32:09,680
that's convenient

6021
05:32:09,680 --> 05:32:12,480
and it seems to that we can do

6022
05:32:12,480 --> 05:32:15,440
a lot of fun stuff

6023
05:32:17,600 --> 05:32:20,240
so i just checked

6024
05:32:20,240 --> 05:32:22,718
what jobs there were we have a job

6025
05:32:22,718 --> 05:32:23,760
called

6026
05:32:23,760 --> 05:32:25,840
ship diagnostics

6027
05:32:25,840 --> 05:32:29,360
all right kind of makes sense

6028
05:32:30,320 --> 05:32:32,558
and this vendor

6029
05:32:32,558 --> 05:32:34,000
has

6030
05:32:34,000 --> 05:32:35,200
quite a lot

6031
05:32:35,200 --> 05:32:37,600
of the software in these

6032
05:32:37,600 --> 05:32:40,160
are on github it's open source so i

6033
05:32:40,160 --> 05:32:42,718
checked their repo and found that yeah

6034
05:32:42,718 --> 05:32:44,080
there is

6035
05:32:44,080 --> 05:32:44,840
a

6036
05:32:44,840 --> 05:32:48,958
task or or and python function that is

6037
05:32:48,958 --> 05:32:51,520
called run ship diagnostics

6038
05:32:51,520 --> 05:32:53,040
task

6039
05:32:53,040 --> 05:32:56,480
so we can call python functions

6040
05:32:56,480 --> 05:32:59,798
it's a start

6041
05:33:00,080 --> 05:33:03,440
and i tried calling os.name because i

6042
05:33:03,440 --> 05:33:05,840
want to do things with the os the python

6043
05:33:05,840 --> 05:33:08,400
world isn't that fun

6044
05:33:08,400 --> 05:33:10,878
and i got an error back saying

6045
05:33:10,878 --> 05:33:14,958
pro 6 is not a callable object

6046
05:33:14,958 --> 05:33:18,480
well posik is what os name normally

6047
05:33:18,480 --> 05:33:19,680
returns

6048
05:33:19,680 --> 05:33:22,480
so we have some sort of evaluation going

6049
05:33:22,480 --> 05:33:24,958
on here

6050
05:33:25,440 --> 05:33:26,240
and

6051
05:33:26,240 --> 05:33:28,798
i'm not sure what i did it was probably

6052
05:33:28,798 --> 05:33:30,878
very late at night

6053
05:33:30,878 --> 05:33:32,958
but i figured out that normally in

6054
05:33:32,958 --> 05:33:37,120
python you call os dot name but here i

6055
05:33:37,120 --> 05:33:40,718
needed to call os colon name

6056
05:33:40,718 --> 05:33:42,878
and if someone knows why please let me

6057
05:33:42,878 --> 05:33:45,440
know later i have no idea but

6058
05:33:45,440 --> 05:33:48,958
this this notation works

6059
05:33:49,600 --> 05:33:52,480
i could evaluate the environment and get

6060
05:33:52,480 --> 05:33:56,760
all the environment variables

6061
05:33:57,120 --> 05:34:01,680
and we're running at root it seems

6062
05:34:01,680 --> 05:34:04,480
very convenient

6063
05:34:07,120 --> 05:34:08,320
but still

6064
05:34:08,320 --> 05:34:10,160
running this i didn't get that much

6065
05:34:10,160 --> 05:34:12,878
information so i installed the

6066
05:34:12,878 --> 05:34:16,638
ap scheduler uh locally on my machine

6067
05:34:16,638 --> 05:34:18,160
and accessed it

6068
05:34:18,160 --> 05:34:20,878
so then i could see what happened on the

6069
05:34:20,878 --> 05:34:23,200
other side

6070
05:34:23,200 --> 05:34:26,080
so i tried something it said well i'm

6071
05:34:26,080 --> 05:34:27,520
missing

6072
05:34:27,520 --> 05:34:28,798
arguments

6073
05:34:28,798 --> 05:34:33,520
okay read up a bit try to tweak it

6074
05:34:34,080 --> 05:34:38,000
and then i figured out how to

6075
05:34:38,000 --> 05:34:41,440
run the uptime command

6076
05:34:41,440 --> 05:34:44,718
so we have some sort of shell we can run

6077
05:34:44,718 --> 05:34:47,280
binaries

6078
05:34:47,280 --> 05:34:50,400
but this output i got on my debug

6079
05:34:50,400 --> 05:34:52,480
instance on my local machine

6080
05:34:52,480 --> 05:34:56,320
i wouldn't get the output through

6081
05:34:56,320 --> 05:34:59,920
the the curl command

6082
05:35:00,400 --> 05:35:01,440
so

6083
05:35:01,440 --> 05:35:04,718
i piped the output to curl posted it to

6084
05:35:04,718 --> 05:35:08,798
just a simple log file that i have

6085
05:35:08,798 --> 05:35:11,840
so i could read it

6086
05:35:11,840 --> 05:35:15,520
then i tried to install some tools

6087
05:35:15,520 --> 05:35:18,240
run update update well i could do other

6088
05:35:18,240 --> 05:35:20,480
things but that's very convenient to

6089
05:35:20,480 --> 05:35:21,280
just

6090
05:35:21,280 --> 05:35:23,360
use the package manager

6091
05:35:23,360 --> 05:35:24,798
but

6092
05:35:24,798 --> 05:35:28,000
when i run it it says no data on my

6093
05:35:28,000 --> 05:35:30,400
server

6094
05:35:30,878 --> 05:35:33,600
you see here it also says

6095
05:35:33,600 --> 05:35:35,520
expect

6096
05:35:35,520 --> 05:35:37,840
100 continue

6097
05:35:37,840 --> 05:35:39,680
so that's how

6098
05:35:39,680 --> 05:35:44,558
you in http uh cut use several

6099
05:35:44,558 --> 05:35:49,600
packages to concatenate a long answer

6100
05:35:49,600 --> 05:35:52,878
i thought golang is fun so i'll just

6101
05:35:52,878 --> 05:35:55,920
find some code on the internet that does

6102
05:35:55,920 --> 05:35:57,120
support

6103
05:35:57,120 --> 05:35:58,080
chunking

6104
05:35:58,080 --> 05:36:01,120
so i can get the output

6105
05:36:01,520 --> 05:36:03,920
and now i get the full output of the

6106
05:36:03,920 --> 05:36:06,798
command i run

6107
05:36:13,520 --> 05:36:15,520
i installed netcat because it makes

6108
05:36:15,520 --> 05:36:18,240
things easy

6109
05:36:20,240 --> 05:36:21,280
and

6110
05:36:21,280 --> 05:36:24,718
what's really neat with this scheduler

6111
05:36:24,718 --> 05:36:26,160
is that

6112
05:36:26,160 --> 05:36:28,638
it will not spawn more shells

6113
05:36:28,638 --> 05:36:31,200
while the existing shell is running

6114
05:36:31,200 --> 05:36:32,000
because

6115
05:36:32,000 --> 05:36:34,000
the the scheduler is supposed to keep

6116
05:36:34,000 --> 05:36:35,600
one thing running

6117
05:36:35,600 --> 05:36:36,718
but if

6118
05:36:36,718 --> 05:36:38,958
my reverse shell dies

6119
05:36:38,958 --> 05:36:40,958
the scheduler will spawn a new one for

6120
05:36:40,958 --> 05:36:42,400
me

6121
05:36:42,400 --> 05:36:45,718
very nice

6122
05:36:47,200 --> 05:36:51,040
so now i have a full reverse shell

6123
05:36:51,040 --> 05:36:53,520
and i'm thinking about that ssh service

6124
05:36:53,520 --> 05:36:55,200
that i saw earlier

6125
05:36:55,200 --> 05:36:57,440
but there's no ssh

6126
05:36:57,440 --> 05:36:58,878
process running

6127
05:36:58,878 --> 05:37:01,840
and there's nothing that binds to port

6128
05:37:01,840 --> 05:37:05,280
22 222

6129
05:37:05,840 --> 05:37:08,000
i knew then that

6130
05:37:08,000 --> 05:37:10,718
these devices run on something called

6131
05:37:10,718 --> 05:37:13,040
ballena which is

6132
05:37:13,040 --> 05:37:15,520
based on docker so i'm probably inside a

6133
05:37:15,520 --> 05:37:17,120
docker

6134
05:37:17,120 --> 05:37:19,920
that's no fun

6135
05:37:21,360 --> 05:37:22,558
so we need to

6136
05:37:22,558 --> 05:37:24,558
escape out of the docker

6137
05:37:24,558 --> 05:37:27,120
and i figured out that i could

6138
05:37:27,120 --> 05:37:29,360
there are lots of really fancy docker

6139
05:37:29,360 --> 05:37:31,360
escapes out there

6140
05:37:31,360 --> 05:37:32,718
but i

6141
05:37:32,718 --> 05:37:35,600
could read the entire sd card or

6142
05:37:35,600 --> 05:37:38,240
that has or it's not an sd card actually

6143
05:37:38,240 --> 05:37:41,920
it's a soldered thing i can't remove it

6144
05:37:41,920 --> 05:37:42,878
but

6145
05:37:42,878 --> 05:37:47,280
i could mount anything i wanted

6146
05:37:47,920 --> 05:37:50,558
so i mounted i just messed around until

6147
05:37:50,558 --> 05:37:53,200
i found something interesting

6148
05:37:53,200 --> 05:37:56,638
i found an authorized keys

6149
05:37:56,638 --> 05:37:58,000
file

6150
05:37:58,000 --> 05:38:03,280
that i just added my own ssh key

6151
05:38:03,520 --> 05:38:05,440
because why make it hard when it can be

6152
05:38:05,440 --> 05:38:08,680
really easy

6153
05:38:10,480 --> 05:38:13,680
so i just ssh into the machine my key is

6154
05:38:13,680 --> 05:38:15,840
accepted

6155
05:38:15,840 --> 05:38:19,200
i am root i can list all the docker

6156
05:38:19,200 --> 05:38:20,558
containers

6157
05:38:20,558 --> 05:38:22,558
i have full access

6158
05:38:22,558 --> 05:38:25,680
to this machine

6159
05:38:27,600 --> 05:38:29,120
well that's what i

6160
05:38:29,120 --> 05:38:30,958
kind of wanted well i didn't really want

6161
05:38:30,958 --> 05:38:32,480
that because

6162
05:38:32,480 --> 05:38:35,040
i was responsible for rolling out a few

6163
05:38:35,040 --> 05:38:37,200
hundred of these

6164
05:38:37,200 --> 05:38:38,718
so i didn't want

6165
05:38:38,718 --> 05:38:42,878
them to be this hackable really

6166
05:38:43,440 --> 05:38:44,320
but

6167
05:38:44,320 --> 05:38:46,958
okay i had local access

6168
05:38:46,958 --> 05:38:49,200
nobody's gonna put their miner on an

6169
05:38:49,200 --> 05:38:51,280
open internet connection right

6170
05:38:51,280 --> 05:38:53,040
because we have firewalls and we have

6171
05:38:53,040 --> 05:38:55,840
nat routers

6172
05:38:59,040 --> 05:39:03,120
so i just ran a google search for some

6173
05:39:03,120 --> 05:39:05,840
text that appears on the port 80

6174
05:39:05,840 --> 05:39:08,638
endpoint the first just a slash it's a

6175
05:39:08,638 --> 05:39:11,120
diagnostics page

6176
05:39:11,120 --> 05:39:12,718
and

6177
05:39:12,718 --> 05:39:14,558
see this is page

6178
05:39:14,558 --> 05:39:15,680
8

6179
05:39:15,680 --> 05:39:19,520
and there are 491 results

6180
05:39:19,520 --> 05:39:20,958
that are remotely

6181
05:39:20,958 --> 05:39:23,440
exploitable i accessed a few of them

6182
05:39:23,440 --> 05:39:25,600
just to check and yeah

6183
05:39:25,600 --> 05:39:29,239
it's the same stuff

6184
05:39:33,040 --> 05:39:36,080
so what can we do with a remote shell

6185
05:39:36,080 --> 05:39:38,320
uh

6186
05:39:38,400 --> 05:39:40,958
well a lot of people that buy those they

6187
05:39:40,958 --> 05:39:43,600
do it to earn this coin they have a

6188
05:39:43,600 --> 05:39:45,840
crypto wallet they put this on their

6189
05:39:45,840 --> 05:39:49,120
home network where they probably also

6190
05:39:49,120 --> 05:39:51,520
have the device probably the phone that

6191
05:39:51,520 --> 05:39:53,440
holds their private

6192
05:39:53,440 --> 05:39:54,480
key

6193
05:39:54,480 --> 05:39:56,000
to the wallet

6194
05:39:56,000 --> 05:39:59,360
so i have a foothold inside their home

6195
05:39:59,360 --> 05:40:00,558
network

6196
05:40:00,558 --> 05:40:03,440
that i can use to attack people

6197
05:40:03,440 --> 05:40:05,200
or at least gather information about

6198
05:40:05,200 --> 05:40:07,040
them that's not really good

6199
05:40:07,040 --> 05:40:08,638
you could of course enlist them in a

6200
05:40:08,638 --> 05:40:11,200
botnet

6201
05:40:11,600 --> 05:40:13,360
there's a really interesting thing

6202
05:40:13,360 --> 05:40:16,000
because you get rewarded on how many

6203
05:40:16,000 --> 05:40:16,958
other

6204
05:40:16,958 --> 05:40:19,920
signals you see

6205
05:40:20,480 --> 05:40:22,480
i could then

6206
05:40:22,480 --> 05:40:27,280
steal the traffic that all these

6207
05:40:27,280 --> 05:40:30,558
400 something c send that to my own

6208
05:40:30,558 --> 05:40:34,240
miners and claim i also saw it

6209
05:40:34,240 --> 05:40:38,000
and that would give me more crypto

6210
05:40:38,000 --> 05:40:41,958
so that's something to do

6211
05:40:42,000 --> 05:40:43,360
and

6212
05:40:43,360 --> 05:40:45,680
during the break i discussed it briefly

6213
05:40:45,680 --> 05:40:49,120
and i got a really great suggestion uh

6214
05:40:49,120 --> 05:40:53,040
that the cryptokeys are in a

6215
05:40:53,040 --> 05:40:57,200
an hsm a security module so i can't

6216
05:40:57,200 --> 05:41:01,360
really fetch them even if i'm root

6217
05:41:01,360 --> 05:41:04,320
but maybe i can write them

6218
05:41:04,320 --> 05:41:07,120
that would mean that i could enlist all

6219
05:41:07,120 --> 05:41:09,200
those that i found on the internet to

6220
05:41:09,200 --> 05:41:11,280
instead of earning money to

6221
05:41:11,280 --> 05:41:13,600
their owner's wallet they could earn

6222
05:41:13,600 --> 05:41:17,040
this crypto to my wallet

6223
05:41:17,040 --> 05:41:20,080
i like that idea

6224
05:41:20,638 --> 05:41:23,760
of course i didn't do that i did the

6225
05:41:23,760 --> 05:41:25,680
responsible thing and tried to figure

6226
05:41:25,680 --> 05:41:26,958
out how

6227
05:41:26,958 --> 05:41:30,240
to fix this particular problem

6228
05:41:30,240 --> 05:41:33,200
and as with a lot of problems the fix

6229
05:41:33,200 --> 05:41:35,280
can be pretty simple

6230
05:41:35,280 --> 05:41:37,718
their code had a line that says

6231
05:41:37,718 --> 05:41:41,760
scheduler api enabled true

6232
05:41:41,760 --> 05:41:43,760
if you set that to false there will be

6233
05:41:43,760 --> 05:41:45,840
no scheduler endpoint and there's

6234
05:41:45,840 --> 05:41:48,638
nothing you can do

6235
05:41:50,160 --> 05:41:52,878
of course it would be good to tighten up

6236
05:41:52,878 --> 05:41:54,718
the docker security

6237
05:41:54,718 --> 05:41:56,240
because

6238
05:41:56,240 --> 05:41:59,280
isolation without really isolation how

6239
05:41:59,280 --> 05:42:01,040
clever is that

6240
05:42:01,040 --> 05:42:04,040
um

6241
05:42:07,120 --> 05:42:10,320
but coding is hard

6242
05:42:10,320 --> 05:42:11,840
and

6243
05:42:11,840 --> 05:42:13,600
i was thinking would a code review have

6244
05:42:13,600 --> 05:42:15,360
caught this

6245
05:42:15,360 --> 05:42:18,000
and i checked some some commits of

6246
05:42:18,000 --> 05:42:20,000
course i could do

6247
05:42:20,000 --> 05:42:21,760
digging it and find when it was

6248
05:42:21,760 --> 05:42:24,240
introduced

6249
05:42:24,240 --> 05:42:26,000
and would anyone guess which of these

6250
05:42:26,000 --> 05:42:28,798
commits introduced

6251
05:42:28,798 --> 05:42:31,360
the problem

6252
05:42:31,440 --> 05:42:33,520
do we have any hands up for

6253
05:42:33,520 --> 05:42:36,320
the first one

6254
05:42:36,718 --> 05:42:39,760
right how about the second

6255
05:42:39,760 --> 05:42:42,080
all right some hands

6256
05:42:42,080 --> 05:42:44,320
third one

6257
05:42:44,320 --> 05:42:48,160
nobody thinks that okay fourth

6258
05:42:48,160 --> 05:42:49,440
as some

6259
05:42:49,440 --> 05:42:51,920
all right

6260
05:42:53,680 --> 05:42:54,638
and

6261
05:42:54,638 --> 05:42:57,680
it's actually the second one

6262
05:42:57,680 --> 05:43:00,000
this was introduced when they converted

6263
05:43:00,000 --> 05:43:03,360
the app to a flask app

6264
05:43:03,360 --> 05:43:04,400
and

6265
05:43:04,400 --> 05:43:09,040
yeah it's hard to to find but

6266
05:43:09,520 --> 05:43:11,600
i think that

6267
05:43:11,600 --> 05:43:13,920
there will be mistakes made and the

6268
05:43:13,920 --> 05:43:16,480
important thing is is there a way to

6269
05:43:16,480 --> 05:43:19,200
report the problem

6270
05:43:19,200 --> 05:43:20,958
is there

6271
05:43:20,958 --> 05:43:24,160
a way to fix the problem push out a fix

6272
05:43:24,160 --> 05:43:27,040
do you have automatic updates

6273
05:43:27,040 --> 05:43:28,878
i contacted the vendor

6274
05:43:28,878 --> 05:43:30,958
the first response was like we don't

6275
05:43:30,958 --> 05:43:33,840
think this is important

6276
05:43:33,840 --> 05:43:36,000
and that was partly me to blame because

6277
05:43:36,000 --> 05:43:38,958
i hadn't really explained i said i can

6278
05:43:38,958 --> 05:43:42,080
do this on my minor and they're like

6279
05:43:42,080 --> 05:43:43,920
well you own it you can do whatever you

6280
05:43:43,920 --> 05:43:46,320
like i was like yeah but i can also do

6281
05:43:46,320 --> 05:43:48,240
it to all these sites

6282
05:43:48,240 --> 05:43:50,480
or machines i found on google and

6283
05:43:50,480 --> 05:43:52,320
they're like okay

6284
05:43:52,320 --> 05:43:53,920
so

6285
05:43:53,920 --> 05:43:57,360
i luckily i had some previous contact

6286
05:43:57,360 --> 05:43:59,280
with this company

6287
05:43:59,280 --> 05:44:01,040
i had met the

6288
05:44:01,040 --> 05:44:04,320
ceo and and the two founders in a pub in

6289
05:44:04,320 --> 05:44:07,120
london uh half a year earlier

6290
05:44:07,120 --> 05:44:09,280
and i had a support

6291
05:44:09,280 --> 05:44:11,200
support access through slack to them so

6292
05:44:11,200 --> 05:44:14,160
i posted in the support channel

6293
05:44:14,160 --> 05:44:15,840
it took a while before they really got

6294
05:44:15,840 --> 05:44:18,160
what the problem was and when they got

6295
05:44:18,160 --> 05:44:20,878
it five minutes later the ceo pops in in

6296
05:44:20,878 --> 05:44:22,240
the support thread

6297
05:44:22,240 --> 05:44:24,160
i don't think that normally happens on

6298
05:44:24,160 --> 05:44:26,240
big companies but this is quite a small

6299
05:44:26,240 --> 05:44:27,760
company

6300
05:44:27,760 --> 05:44:30,160
and

6301
05:44:31,920 --> 05:44:33,840
after they really realized what the

6302
05:44:33,840 --> 05:44:36,400
problem was it was patched later the

6303
05:44:36,400 --> 05:44:37,600
same day

6304
05:44:37,600 --> 05:44:40,160
i think within two hours and they pushed

6305
05:44:40,160 --> 05:44:43,840
out an update later that day

6306
05:44:43,840 --> 05:44:44,638
so

6307
05:44:44,638 --> 05:44:45,680
then

6308
05:44:45,680 --> 05:44:48,320
at least this particular

6309
05:44:48,320 --> 05:44:50,240
way of attacking was

6310
05:44:50,240 --> 05:44:53,240
plugged

6311
05:45:00,000 --> 05:45:01,280
so

6312
05:45:01,280 --> 05:45:04,558
of course your security people you

6313
05:45:04,558 --> 05:45:06,480
probably know how to attack things

6314
05:45:06,480 --> 05:45:10,240
already but maybe not hardware well

6315
05:45:10,240 --> 05:45:12,320
hardware run software

6316
05:45:12,320 --> 05:45:14,320
and you can use tools that you're

6317
05:45:14,320 --> 05:45:16,878
probably already familiar with

6318
05:45:16,878 --> 05:45:19,920
i used nmap to check which ports i could

6319
05:45:19,920 --> 05:45:23,840
attack the crawl bot thing to see

6320
05:45:23,840 --> 05:45:25,760
what end points are available and

6321
05:45:25,760 --> 05:45:28,000
there's something uh

6322
05:45:28,000 --> 05:45:30,878
i was thinking about because crawl bot

6323
05:45:30,878 --> 05:45:35,760
has a word list of i think 6 000

6324
05:45:35,760 --> 05:45:39,519
different endpoints that it tries

6325
05:45:39,600 --> 05:45:41,200
since a lot of

6326
05:45:41,200 --> 05:45:44,558
the software is open source i could have

6327
05:45:44,558 --> 05:45:46,638
pulled all the strings from the source

6328
05:45:46,638 --> 05:45:49,120
code and just fed it through the crawl

6329
05:45:49,120 --> 05:45:50,480
bot to see

6330
05:45:50,480 --> 05:45:53,680
if i found something else

6331
05:45:54,798 --> 05:45:56,878
i used curl to

6332
05:45:56,878 --> 05:45:59,120
access the service

6333
05:45:59,120 --> 05:46:01,360
some people might prefer postman of

6334
05:46:01,360 --> 05:46:04,718
course that works as well

6335
05:46:04,718 --> 05:46:06,958
you can use whatever tool you like

6336
05:46:06,958 --> 05:46:09,440
i had the chunked server that was a big

6337
05:46:09,440 --> 05:46:11,440
key to exfiltrate

6338
05:46:11,440 --> 05:46:14,000
the information for my command because

6339
05:46:14,000 --> 05:46:17,360
before i found out that i could not get

6340
05:46:17,360 --> 05:46:19,520
back what really happened so it was a

6341
05:46:19,520 --> 05:46:22,958
lot of trial and error

6342
05:46:24,320 --> 05:46:27,280
and then netcat for a reverse shell

6343
05:46:27,280 --> 05:46:30,520
pretty basic

6344
05:46:33,120 --> 05:46:35,920
so that's what i did

6345
05:46:35,920 --> 05:46:38,638
any questions

6346
05:46:44,718 --> 05:46:46,240
does nobody have any questions i mean

6347
05:46:46,240 --> 05:46:49,600
we're talking about crypto here guys

6348
05:46:49,680 --> 05:46:51,920
yeah if someone has the the bing

6349
05:46:51,920 --> 05:46:54,798
 bingo scorecard i think i'm

6350
05:46:54,798 --> 05:46:56,400
pretty good at it now did you mention

6351
05:46:56,400 --> 05:46:58,160
cyber yet

6352
05:46:58,160 --> 05:46:58,958
no

6353
05:46:58,958 --> 05:47:02,558
well i did yeah thanks

6354
05:47:02,558 --> 05:47:04,798
uh nothing uh well actually i have a

6355
05:47:04,798 --> 05:47:06,878
question so you mentioned you found uh

6356
05:47:06,878 --> 05:47:09,120
was it 450

6357
05:47:09,120 --> 05:47:12,160
something open uh instances of this yes

6358
05:47:12,160 --> 05:47:15,600
um but the coverage map is huge

6359
05:47:15,600 --> 05:47:18,638
uh what what did you say like 800 000

6360
05:47:18,638 --> 05:47:19,840
devices

6361
05:47:19,840 --> 05:47:22,958
yeah there are multiple vendors right so

6362
05:47:22,958 --> 05:47:24,558
there are like 10

6363
05:47:24,558 --> 05:47:26,638
10 different vendors this particular

6364
05:47:26,638 --> 05:47:29,920
vendor i think has shipped about

6365
05:47:29,920 --> 05:47:31,920
eighty thousand or something like that

6366
05:47:31,920 --> 05:47:33,840
so ten percent of the network so would

6367
05:47:33,840 --> 05:47:35,600
you think that the reason for the only

6368
05:47:35,600 --> 05:47:38,480
being 450 is that that those were only

6369
05:47:38,480 --> 05:47:40,558
the ones you found or is it that people

6370
05:47:40,558 --> 05:47:41,600
are not

6371
05:47:41,600 --> 05:47:43,440
they're not remotely accessible or have

6372
05:47:43,440 --> 05:47:44,798
people been doing making their own

6373
05:47:44,798 --> 05:47:47,280
configuration changes what do you think

6374
05:47:47,280 --> 05:47:49,200
i don't think they made configuration

6375
05:47:49,200 --> 05:47:51,520
changes because this is supposed to be

6376
05:47:51,520 --> 05:47:53,280
fairly locked down

6377
05:47:53,280 --> 05:47:56,798
without getting this access there

6378
05:47:56,798 --> 05:47:59,360
the vendors are not allowed to give

6379
05:47:59,360 --> 05:48:02,160
shell access to even to the owner right

6380
05:48:02,160 --> 05:48:03,680
so i don't think it's remote

6381
05:48:03,680 --> 05:48:07,680
configuration it's probably

6382
05:48:07,760 --> 05:48:11,120
maybe people put them on

6383
05:48:11,120 --> 05:48:13,520
somewhere high up

6384
05:48:13,520 --> 05:48:14,400
and

6385
05:48:14,400 --> 05:48:16,320
there's not an internet connection so

6386
05:48:16,320 --> 05:48:19,680
they use a sim card that's not behind a

6387
05:48:19,680 --> 05:48:22,240
nut so it's full for lexus

6388
05:48:22,240 --> 05:48:24,798
that could be the case uh i tried

6389
05:48:24,798 --> 05:48:28,080
searching a bit through showdown but i

6390
05:48:28,080 --> 05:48:29,840
didn't find anything interesting because

6391
05:48:29,840 --> 05:48:31,680
there it would be interesting to get

6392
05:48:31,680 --> 05:48:34,400
this statistics to see

6393
05:48:34,400 --> 05:48:38,080
what types of ips what countries

6394
05:48:38,080 --> 05:48:40,718
but i didn't dig into that okay well

6395
05:48:40,718 --> 05:48:43,200
maybe it's

6396
05:48:43,680 --> 05:48:45,280
yeah exactly and maybe it's an area for

6397
05:48:45,280 --> 05:48:46,958
further research

6398
05:48:46,958 --> 05:48:48,480
yeah it could be okay do we have any

6399
05:48:48,480 --> 05:48:51,040
more questions

6400
05:48:51,600 --> 05:48:54,000
okay it looks like that's it oh actually

6401
05:48:54,000 --> 05:48:56,400
over here

6402
05:49:01,200 --> 05:49:02,638
could you repeat the question michael

6403
05:49:02,638 --> 05:49:04,000
yeah if i

6404
05:49:04,000 --> 05:49:06,000
if i estimated the value of tokens i

6405
05:49:06,000 --> 05:49:07,360
could steal

6406
05:49:07,360 --> 05:49:10,798
or well existing tokens then i would

6407
05:49:10,798 --> 05:49:12,400
have to

6408
05:49:12,400 --> 05:49:14,558
break into someone's wallet

6409
05:49:14,558 --> 05:49:16,400
and then of course that that wallet

6410
05:49:16,400 --> 05:49:18,638
could be either empty or have a few

6411
05:49:18,638 --> 05:49:22,718
hundred thousand dollars or euros

6412
05:49:22,718 --> 05:49:25,840
the average for any of those on the

6413
05:49:25,840 --> 05:49:28,638
network is about

6414
05:49:28,638 --> 05:49:32,320
i think about a hundred euros per month

6415
05:49:32,320 --> 05:49:34,878
right now so with these

6416
05:49:34,878 --> 05:49:37,040
450

6417
05:49:37,040 --> 05:49:41,840
it's 45 000 euros per month

6418
05:49:41,840 --> 05:49:46,160
that's a pretty nice passive income yeah

6419
05:49:46,320 --> 05:49:49,638
any more questions

6420
05:49:49,920 --> 05:49:51,760
okay looks like that's it all right

6421
05:49:51,760 --> 05:49:53,690
thank you so much thank you

6422
05:49:53,690 --> 05:50:00,400
[Applause]

6423
05:50:00,400 --> 05:50:03,200
all right um

6424
05:50:03,200 --> 05:50:05,120
so as you can tell probably by looking

6425
05:50:05,120 --> 05:50:07,520
behind me it's time for a long-awaited

6426
05:50:07,520 --> 05:50:08,958
coffee break

6427
05:50:08,958 --> 05:50:11,360
i think we all need it at this point and

6428
05:50:11,360 --> 05:50:13,360
because it's our fifth

6429
05:50:13,360 --> 05:50:14,798
anniversary

6430
05:50:14,798 --> 05:50:17,760
uh we will have cake

6431
05:50:17,760 --> 05:50:19,440
it's not a lie

6432
05:50:19,440 --> 05:50:21,680
but it is first come first serve

6433
05:50:21,680 --> 05:50:25,240
so charge

6434
06:29:09,040 --> 06:29:10,718
really excited to be here appreciate the

6435
06:29:10,718 --> 06:29:13,040
invitation so this

6436
06:29:13,040 --> 06:29:14,638
presentation we're going to talk about

6437
06:29:14,638 --> 06:29:15,440
some

6438
06:29:15,440 --> 06:29:17,120
cyber activities

6439
06:29:17,120 --> 06:29:20,240
that have happened historically in space

6440
06:29:20,240 --> 06:29:23,120
and we'll get into some best practices

6441
06:29:23,120 --> 06:29:26,558
as the space industries develops and

6442
06:29:26,558 --> 06:29:28,558
experts like ourselves professionals get

6443
06:29:28,558 --> 06:29:29,920
involved with

6444
06:29:29,920 --> 06:29:32,160
helping secure space systems

6445
06:29:32,160 --> 06:29:33,760
help put

6446
06:29:33,760 --> 06:29:36,400
bring some good best practices to light

6447
06:29:36,400 --> 06:29:38,240
to make sure it's on your radar

6448
06:29:38,240 --> 06:29:39,120
but

6449
06:29:39,120 --> 06:29:41,360
to lay a good foundation we start

6450
06:29:41,360 --> 06:29:42,878
talking about space systems if you're

6451
06:29:42,878 --> 06:29:46,000
not familiar with space systems

6452
06:29:46,000 --> 06:29:48,080
here on the earth we have what we call

6453
06:29:48,080 --> 06:29:49,840
ground stations similar think of a

6454
06:29:49,840 --> 06:29:51,360
ground station as like your network

6455
06:29:51,360 --> 06:29:52,878
operations center your security

6456
06:29:52,878 --> 06:29:54,558
operations center for your enterprise

6457
06:29:54,558 --> 06:29:57,600
business your telecommunications company

6458
06:29:57,600 --> 06:29:59,520
the space systems are going to have a

6459
06:29:59,520 --> 06:30:01,120
ground station system where they can

6460
06:30:01,120 --> 06:30:02,240
monitor

6461
06:30:02,240 --> 06:30:04,638
and keep up with the health and status

6462
06:30:04,638 --> 06:30:07,520
of the satellite the spacecraft itself

6463
06:30:07,520 --> 06:30:09,600
and the payloads that are on the

6464
06:30:09,600 --> 06:30:12,160
spacecraft and in this example we have a

6465
06:30:12,160 --> 06:30:14,000
picture of nasa

6466
06:30:14,000 --> 06:30:15,840
who has ground stations around the world

6467
06:30:15,840 --> 06:30:17,600
for this particular project so that they

6468
06:30:17,600 --> 06:30:18,878
can control

6469
06:30:18,878 --> 06:30:22,080
the spacecraft and the payloads

6470
06:30:22,080 --> 06:30:24,000
so they're so no matter where the

6471
06:30:24,000 --> 06:30:25,920
spacecraft is in orbit they have

6472
06:30:25,920 --> 06:30:28,240
visibility and can communicate with

6473
06:30:28,240 --> 06:30:31,120
those spacecraft

6474
06:30:31,360 --> 06:30:33,360
now what i found really interesting when

6475
06:30:33,360 --> 06:30:35,680
i started doing research on this subject

6476
06:30:35,680 --> 06:30:37,600
is everyone's talking about the cloud

6477
06:30:37,600 --> 06:30:39,440
every you know who isn't doesn't have a

6478
06:30:39,440 --> 06:30:41,600
big cloud project going on these days

6479
06:30:41,600 --> 06:30:43,360
well interestingly enough

6480
06:30:43,360 --> 06:30:45,520
with the all of the new capabilities

6481
06:30:45,520 --> 06:30:47,360
that are being developed with space it

6482
06:30:47,360 --> 06:30:50,000
space is also utilizing the cloud

6483
06:30:50,000 --> 06:30:53,840
microsoft leaf space out of italy

6484
06:30:53,840 --> 06:30:57,120
uh amazon aws

6485
06:30:57,120 --> 06:30:59,200
google they're all

6486
06:30:59,200 --> 06:31:01,920
building out a space support capability

6487
06:31:01,920 --> 06:31:03,840
where they where you can outsource your

6488
06:31:03,840 --> 06:31:05,520
ground station

6489
06:31:05,520 --> 06:31:07,680
to their data center and instead of

6490
06:31:07,680 --> 06:31:09,760
having to build your own private ground

6491
06:31:09,760 --> 06:31:12,320
station network you can use their

6492
06:31:12,320 --> 06:31:13,760
infrastructure which i find really

6493
06:31:13,760 --> 06:31:15,360
interesting that the

6494
06:31:15,360 --> 06:31:18,080
how uh space is moving to the cloud but

6495
06:31:18,080 --> 06:31:20,638
also along those same lines

6496
06:31:20,638 --> 06:31:21,840
if you haven't been following anything

6497
06:31:21,840 --> 06:31:24,638
news there is a great deal of of a data

6498
06:31:24,638 --> 06:31:25,680
center

6499
06:31:25,680 --> 06:31:27,600
uh cloud infrastructure that's actually

6500
06:31:27,600 --> 06:31:29,840
being looked at moving to space there's

6501
06:31:29,840 --> 06:31:31,840
a company called leo cloud where they're

6502
06:31:31,840 --> 06:31:33,680
going to put storage capabilities in

6503
06:31:33,680 --> 06:31:34,638
space

6504
06:31:34,638 --> 06:31:36,958
there's a ramos out of italy that's just

6505
06:31:36,958 --> 06:31:40,638
developed a two terabyte hard drive to

6506
06:31:40,638 --> 06:31:42,638
put on satellites in space for storage

6507
06:31:42,638 --> 06:31:44,958
and i read like a week or two ago that

6508
06:31:44,958 --> 06:31:46,558
there's actually a company that's going

6509
06:31:46,558 --> 06:31:48,718
looking at putting data centers on the

6510
06:31:48,718 --> 06:31:51,600
moon actually in uh lava tunnels on the

6511
06:31:51,600 --> 06:31:53,040
moon so

6512
06:31:53,040 --> 06:31:55,760
so space is moving to the cloud so

6513
06:31:55,760 --> 06:31:58,000
yeah

6514
06:31:58,000 --> 06:32:00,400
everybody's doing it so we've started by

6515
06:32:00,400 --> 06:32:03,360
the satellite some spacecraft

6516
06:32:03,360 --> 06:32:05,840
we have different orbits depending on

6517
06:32:05,840 --> 06:32:08,638
the application of the system it's that

6518
06:32:08,638 --> 06:32:10,478
is uh the mission

6519
06:32:10,478 --> 06:32:13,200
so like uh you know starlink

6520
06:32:13,200 --> 06:32:14,878
is in the news all the time these days

6521
06:32:14,878 --> 06:32:16,400
with elon's uh

6522
06:32:16,400 --> 06:32:18,638
spacex project with the internet

6523
06:32:18,638 --> 06:32:20,160
services they're going to provide and

6524
06:32:20,160 --> 06:32:22,000
that is going in the very low earth

6525
06:32:22,000 --> 06:32:22,958
orbit

6526
06:32:22,958 --> 06:32:25,840
about 250 kilometers to 450 kilometers

6527
06:32:25,840 --> 06:32:28,400
is what's called very low earth orbit

6528
06:32:28,400 --> 06:32:30,320
and then you then there's a low earth

6529
06:32:30,320 --> 06:32:32,958
orbit and with that low earth orbit

6530
06:32:32,958 --> 06:32:34,958
the satellite is orbiting around the

6531
06:32:34,958 --> 06:32:37,120
earth it's about four hour about every

6532
06:32:37,120 --> 06:32:39,440
four hours it'll evolve revolve around

6533
06:32:39,440 --> 06:32:41,520
the orbit around the earth it's spinning

6534
06:32:41,520 --> 06:32:44,000
really fast and then think about geo

6535
06:32:44,000 --> 06:32:46,638
geos like your cable tv

6536
06:32:46,638 --> 06:32:48,320
services your telecommunications

6537
06:32:48,320 --> 06:32:50,718
services where the satellite is locked

6538
06:32:50,718 --> 06:32:54,400
in and orbits with the earth and keeps a

6539
06:32:54,400 --> 06:32:56,878
a fix on a certain geographic area all

6540
06:32:56,878 --> 06:32:58,080
the time that's that's what's happening

6541
06:32:58,080 --> 06:33:00,878
with geo leo is orbiting really fast and

6542
06:33:00,878 --> 06:33:02,958
then the geo is fixed

6543
06:33:02,958 --> 06:33:05,200
on certain points

6544
06:33:05,200 --> 06:33:06,320
so

6545
06:33:06,320 --> 06:33:08,320
so from a threat standpoint we started

6546
06:33:08,320 --> 06:33:10,320
talking about spacecraft systems in

6547
06:33:10,320 --> 06:33:12,080
space

6548
06:33:12,080 --> 06:33:14,558
what the uh the scientists have come up

6549
06:33:14,558 --> 06:33:17,120
with is they categorize deception maybe

6550
06:33:17,120 --> 06:33:18,558
say spoofing

6551
06:33:18,558 --> 06:33:21,200
uh disruption where somebody maybe an

6552
06:33:21,200 --> 06:33:23,200
electronic warfare attack and it's

6553
06:33:23,200 --> 06:33:25,280
really uh we're seeing they used to be

6554
06:33:25,280 --> 06:33:26,798
there was electronic warfare and cyber

6555
06:33:26,798 --> 06:33:28,718
but it's really converging together in a

6556
06:33:28,718 --> 06:33:30,638
lot of the conversations now we're like

6557
06:33:30,638 --> 06:33:31,600
with

6558
06:33:31,600 --> 06:33:33,840
with electronic warfare and cyber being

6559
06:33:33,840 --> 06:33:36,400
under the same umbrella where uh say

6560
06:33:36,400 --> 06:33:38,320
you're doing rf jamming

6561
06:33:38,320 --> 06:33:42,080
maybe uh you know where somebody cranks

6562
06:33:42,080 --> 06:33:44,400
up a high capability electronic warfare

6563
06:33:44,400 --> 06:33:47,760
type system to jam a uh a radio

6564
06:33:47,760 --> 06:33:50,000
frequency signal and then it's removed

6565
06:33:50,000 --> 06:33:51,520
as soon as the power as soon as the

6566
06:33:51,520 --> 06:33:54,000
power is gone the jamming is removed so

6567
06:33:54,000 --> 06:33:56,160
it's a temporary disruption all the way

6568
06:33:56,160 --> 06:33:59,360
to maybe a microwave

6569
06:33:59,360 --> 06:34:01,120
or uh lasers

6570
06:34:01,120 --> 06:34:02,400
where

6571
06:34:02,400 --> 06:34:04,400
certain capabilities in the spacecraft

6572
06:34:04,400 --> 06:34:07,360
could be permanently damaged you could

6573
06:34:07,360 --> 06:34:09,440
um

6574
06:34:09,440 --> 06:34:11,200
and then you know and then the

6575
06:34:11,200 --> 06:34:12,718
degradation and then there's been a lot

6576
06:34:12,718 --> 06:34:14,878
of conversations with destruction

6577
06:34:14,878 --> 06:34:16,400
there's four countries in the world

6578
06:34:16,400 --> 06:34:18,558
right now uh the us

6579
06:34:18,558 --> 06:34:21,440
russia india and china who have

6580
06:34:21,440 --> 06:34:23,120
demonstrated the ability to totally

6581
06:34:23,120 --> 06:34:25,280
destroy a spacecraft with a missile

6582
06:34:25,280 --> 06:34:26,400
the bad thing about doing that

6583
06:34:26,400 --> 06:34:29,360
destruction is it creates a debris field

6584
06:34:29,360 --> 06:34:30,558
uh because they're when you blow

6585
06:34:30,558 --> 06:34:31,760
something up in space you know there's

6586
06:34:31,760 --> 06:34:33,360
not somebody up there sweeping up the

6587
06:34:33,360 --> 06:34:35,280
mess so now we have when that happens

6588
06:34:35,280 --> 06:34:36,958
there are always debris in space and so

6589
06:34:36,958 --> 06:34:38,558
there's a concern now

6590
06:34:38,558 --> 06:34:40,000
that with all the

6591
06:34:40,000 --> 06:34:41,840
with space being populated with so many

6592
06:34:41,840 --> 06:34:43,120
satellites

6593
06:34:43,120 --> 06:34:44,478
and uh

6594
06:34:44,478 --> 06:34:46,478
rockets that have not uh deorbited that

6595
06:34:46,478 --> 06:34:48,160
are still floating around in space

6596
06:34:48,160 --> 06:34:50,798
orbiting their uh

6597
06:34:50,798 --> 06:34:53,280
and with asad activity where

6598
06:34:53,280 --> 06:34:54,718
spacecraft has been blown up it's

6599
06:34:54,718 --> 06:34:56,478
creating a large debris field and

6600
06:34:56,478 --> 06:34:58,558
there's a concern about a chain reaction

6601
06:34:58,558 --> 06:35:00,160
where a piece of debris hits a piece of

6602
06:35:00,160 --> 06:35:02,558
debris or a live satellite that's

6603
06:35:02,558 --> 06:35:04,958
actually in production and coupling

6604
06:35:04,958 --> 06:35:06,958
creates generates more debris and it

6605
06:35:06,958 --> 06:35:09,360
causes a chain reaction where debris

6606
06:35:09,360 --> 06:35:12,000
hits debris called and it just

6607
06:35:12,000 --> 06:35:13,280
ends up being a really big chain

6608
06:35:13,280 --> 06:35:15,600
reaction of more and more debris

6609
06:35:15,600 --> 06:35:17,600
being created it calls it's called a

6610
06:35:17,600 --> 06:35:20,000
kessler syndrome where the low earth

6611
06:35:20,000 --> 06:35:22,400
orbit will no longer be usable

6612
06:35:22,400 --> 06:35:23,920
hopefully we never see that there's a

6613
06:35:23,920 --> 06:35:25,600
lot of activities going on to be able to

6614
06:35:25,600 --> 06:35:27,840
start cleaning up

6615
06:35:27,840 --> 06:35:30,080
the orbit and getting debris out there's

6616
06:35:30,080 --> 06:35:31,280
a lot of interesting work happening

6617
06:35:31,280 --> 06:35:32,400
there

6618
06:35:32,400 --> 06:35:34,080
when we start talking about space system

6619
06:35:34,080 --> 06:35:35,440
uh threats

6620
06:35:35,440 --> 06:35:36,638
in this presentation we'll talk about

6621
06:35:36,638 --> 06:35:39,120
some jamming uh malware there's actually

6622
06:35:39,120 --> 06:35:42,240
i got some examples of malware in space

6623
06:35:42,240 --> 06:35:44,400
spoofing like i said there's

6624
06:35:44,400 --> 06:35:46,240
there's the control network for the

6625
06:35:46,240 --> 06:35:48,400
payload for the like the mission of the

6626
06:35:48,400 --> 06:35:50,400
spacecraft and then the spacecraft

6627
06:35:50,400 --> 06:35:52,240
itself the tt and c

6628
06:35:52,240 --> 06:35:53,520
uh

6629
06:35:53,520 --> 06:35:55,760
and then uh and we're gonna talk about

6630
06:35:55,760 --> 06:35:57,280
a lot of the communication especially

6631
06:35:57,280 --> 06:35:58,320
with the

6632
06:35:58,320 --> 06:36:00,478
systems that are already in orbit are

6633
06:36:00,478 --> 06:36:03,120
not encrypted i always assumed

6634
06:36:03,120 --> 06:36:04,718
everything was encrypted

6635
06:36:04,718 --> 06:36:06,878
well some of it is you know there's a

6636
06:36:06,878 --> 06:36:07,920
great deal that's not and we're going to

6637
06:36:07,920 --> 06:36:10,160
get into some real world examples where

6638
06:36:10,160 --> 06:36:12,240
uh things are not and as we all know

6639
06:36:12,240 --> 06:36:14,878
from doing our enterprise and other

6640
06:36:14,878 --> 06:36:16,320
network

6641
06:36:16,320 --> 06:36:18,798
cyber security operations that if if

6642
06:36:18,798 --> 06:36:20,160
it's unencrypted then we're opening

6643
06:36:20,160 --> 06:36:23,520
ourselves up to replay hijacking etc

6644
06:36:23,520 --> 06:36:25,120
eavesdropping

6645
06:36:25,120 --> 06:36:26,320
so we'll get into some real world

6646
06:36:26,320 --> 06:36:30,160
examples of that now again

6647
06:36:30,160 --> 06:36:32,160
when we start talking about uh

6648
06:36:32,160 --> 06:36:34,878
attacking spacecraft we

6649
06:36:34,878 --> 06:36:36,958
we can we can temporarily degrade the

6650
06:36:36,958 --> 06:36:39,040
services of spacecraft we like

6651
06:36:39,040 --> 06:36:42,478
electronic warfare maybe laser dazzling

6652
06:36:42,478 --> 06:36:45,760
a a sensor on a satellite and when you

6653
06:36:45,760 --> 06:36:47,600
pull those sources away

6654
06:36:47,600 --> 06:36:49,680
shut them down then the spacecraft will

6655
06:36:49,680 --> 06:36:51,360
go on and communicate like it normally

6656
06:36:51,360 --> 06:36:53,760
would so that's reversible but if we

6657
06:36:53,760 --> 06:36:55,680
start going and doing what kinetic

6658
06:36:55,680 --> 06:36:57,760
attacks where we're actually shooting

6659
06:36:57,760 --> 06:36:59,760
missiles uh

6660
06:36:59,760 --> 06:37:01,680
at the satellite or we're using some

6661
06:37:01,680 --> 06:37:03,680
kind of directed energy some kind of uh

6662
06:37:03,680 --> 06:37:05,920
like a microwave high powered microwave

6663
06:37:05,920 --> 06:37:08,638
or high power laser we could

6664
06:37:08,638 --> 06:37:10,478
have effects that totally degrade the

6665
06:37:10,478 --> 06:37:13,520
spacecraft that are non-reversible

6666
06:37:13,520 --> 06:37:14,718
uh

6667
06:37:14,718 --> 06:37:16,240
we'll talk about the

6668
06:37:16,240 --> 06:37:17,760
actors in space

6669
06:37:17,760 --> 06:37:19,680
you know everybody's pretty much aware

6670
06:37:19,680 --> 06:37:22,320
of the viasack

6671
06:37:22,320 --> 06:37:25,280
episode uh in ukraine where the network

6672
06:37:25,280 --> 06:37:27,840
management network for the user

6673
06:37:27,840 --> 06:37:30,400
component of the space system the user

6674
06:37:30,400 --> 06:37:33,360
terminals were uh were basically bricked

6675
06:37:33,360 --> 06:37:35,440
because someone broke into that

6676
06:37:35,440 --> 06:37:37,440
that part of the network through a my

6677
06:37:37,440 --> 06:37:38,958
understanding of misconfigured firewall

6678
06:37:38,958 --> 06:37:41,040
vpn and we're able to change the

6679
06:37:41,040 --> 06:37:43,040
firmware and push out new firmware that

6680
06:37:43,040 --> 06:37:46,638
brick the boxes is my understanding

6681
06:37:47,520 --> 06:37:49,520
which is really interesting as a as a

6682
06:37:49,520 --> 06:37:51,120
network person

6683
06:37:51,120 --> 06:37:52,638
that was the vector that they went

6684
06:37:52,638 --> 06:37:55,120
through the network management there uh

6685
06:37:55,120 --> 06:37:56,160
but then

6686
06:37:56,160 --> 06:37:58,240
so it was a real sophisticated attack

6687
06:37:58,240 --> 06:38:00,240
from that standpoint but there's also

6688
06:38:00,240 --> 06:38:01,840
some really uh

6689
06:38:01,840 --> 06:38:03,280
from you know from a nation-state side

6690
06:38:03,280 --> 06:38:05,120
but there's also some

6691
06:38:05,120 --> 06:38:08,000
problems uh from uh from down to the

6692
06:38:08,000 --> 06:38:09,440
hobbyist

6693
06:38:09,440 --> 06:38:10,798
you don't have to be a nation state to

6694
06:38:10,798 --> 06:38:12,958
be able to go in and pull information

6695
06:38:12,958 --> 06:38:14,958
from satellites it's actually improving

6696
06:38:14,958 --> 06:38:16,638
it's been published at black hat years

6697
06:38:16,638 --> 06:38:19,440
and years ago and more recently

6698
06:38:19,440 --> 06:38:21,680
in the defcon 2 also i believe

6699
06:38:21,680 --> 06:38:22,958
and also recently here in the last

6700
06:38:22,958 --> 06:38:25,040
couple years it's real easy just to go

6701
06:38:25,040 --> 06:38:27,120
in and pull information off of

6702
06:38:27,120 --> 06:38:29,680
satellites that passively will actually

6703
06:38:29,680 --> 06:38:31,440
have to actively do anything and you can

6704
06:38:31,440 --> 06:38:33,360
do it as a hobbyist i know people right

6705
06:38:33,360 --> 06:38:34,558
now who

6706
06:38:34,558 --> 06:38:36,878
are using their their like a home

6707
06:38:36,878 --> 06:38:38,958
satellite dish and are passively just

6708
06:38:38,958 --> 06:38:40,718
pulling internet traffic off of

6709
06:38:40,718 --> 06:38:42,080
satellite lanes could and it's

6710
06:38:42,080 --> 06:38:43,920
unencrypted some of it is encrypted

6711
06:38:43,920 --> 06:38:45,360
because you know they're using encrypted

6712
06:38:45,360 --> 06:38:47,680
applications but the satellite link

6713
06:38:47,680 --> 06:38:50,478
itself is not encrypted so

6714
06:38:50,478 --> 06:38:52,798
the data is only encrypted because

6715
06:38:52,798 --> 06:38:55,520
the apps they're using are encrypted

6716
06:38:55,520 --> 06:38:57,040
key point there is we'll make through as

6717
06:38:57,040 --> 06:38:58,958
we go through this presentation and if

6718
06:38:58,958 --> 06:39:00,160
it needs to be secure you better be

6719
06:39:00,160 --> 06:39:01,600
applying your own encryption don't

6720
06:39:01,600 --> 06:39:02,958
assume that somebody else is encrypting

6721
06:39:02,958 --> 06:39:04,798
for you

6722
06:39:04,798 --> 06:39:06,000
so

6723
06:39:06,000 --> 06:39:06,958
i spent

6724
06:39:06,958 --> 06:39:09,040
since 99 i've been involved with red

6725
06:39:09,040 --> 06:39:11,920
teaming and penetration testing

6726
06:39:11,920 --> 06:39:14,558
for numerous organizations enterprises

6727
06:39:14,558 --> 06:39:15,520
uh

6728
06:39:15,520 --> 06:39:17,920
telecommunication service providers

6729
06:39:17,920 --> 06:39:19,920
and and others

6730
06:39:19,920 --> 06:39:21,760
and also teaching it and i always like

6731
06:39:21,760 --> 06:39:24,638
to go and look at uh offensive thing

6732
06:39:24,638 --> 06:39:26,718
operations from using attack trees to

6733
06:39:26,718 --> 06:39:29,360
tell the story the step-by-step story

6734
06:39:29,360 --> 06:39:31,600
and so this kind of uh

6735
06:39:31,600 --> 06:39:33,520
looking at the space the way i started

6736
06:39:33,520 --> 06:39:34,718
looking at it as i was doing this

6737
06:39:34,718 --> 06:39:36,718
research is uh

6738
06:39:36,718 --> 06:39:38,478
is the ground station to satellite you

6739
06:39:38,478 --> 06:39:40,080
have that trust relationship between the

6740
06:39:40,080 --> 06:39:42,320
ground station and the satellite

6741
06:39:42,320 --> 06:39:44,400
typically was private a private ground

6742
06:39:44,400 --> 06:39:45,280
station

6743
06:39:45,280 --> 06:39:47,360
now like i mentioned earlier in the

6744
06:39:47,360 --> 06:39:51,760
presentation it's moving to the cloud so

6745
06:39:51,760 --> 06:39:53,520
which is going to open up a whole nother

6746
06:39:53,520 --> 06:39:56,400
level of trust relationships

6747
06:39:56,400 --> 06:39:58,718
with the cloud infrastructure that uh is

6748
06:39:58,718 --> 06:39:59,760
going to be trusted it's going to need

6749
06:39:59,760 --> 06:40:01,440
to be locked down so that's going to

6750
06:40:01,440 --> 06:40:03,920
open up a really broad attack surface

6751
06:40:03,920 --> 06:40:06,240
of the insider threat inside of the

6752
06:40:06,240 --> 06:40:08,000
organization who is paying for the

6753
06:40:08,000 --> 06:40:11,120
mission funding the mission and the uh

6754
06:40:11,120 --> 06:40:12,558
whoever wherever we're hosting it

6755
06:40:12,558 --> 06:40:13,760
whether it's in our private ground

6756
06:40:13,760 --> 06:40:15,520
station or in a cloud

6757
06:40:15,520 --> 06:40:17,600
we're going to have all that that attack

6758
06:40:17,600 --> 06:40:19,760
surface of uh

6759
06:40:19,760 --> 06:40:21,360
that's going to need to be locked down

6760
06:40:21,360 --> 06:40:23,280
now there's a theoretical scenario

6761
06:40:23,280 --> 06:40:25,120
that's really interesting to me

6762
06:40:25,120 --> 06:40:26,160
i think we're going to probably see

6763
06:40:26,160 --> 06:40:28,000
something in the future

6764
06:40:28,000 --> 06:40:31,120
is uh satellite the satellite

6765
06:40:31,120 --> 06:40:32,718
right now everything that i've been

6766
06:40:32,718 --> 06:40:34,558
reading is ground to satellite but

6767
06:40:34,558 --> 06:40:37,200
there's a i've read a couple papers

6768
06:40:37,200 --> 06:40:38,798
that are talking about satellite to

6769
06:40:38,798 --> 06:40:40,478
satellite being something to be

6770
06:40:40,478 --> 06:40:41,840
considered in the future that'll be

6771
06:40:41,840 --> 06:40:43,440
really interesting

6772
06:40:43,440 --> 06:40:44,878
but there's nothing out there now real

6773
06:40:44,878 --> 06:40:46,878
world that i'm aware of

6774
06:40:46,878 --> 06:40:49,040
and then there's a possible scenario

6775
06:40:49,040 --> 06:40:50,638
this is going to be more sophisticated

6776
06:40:50,638 --> 06:40:52,478
probably a nation state someone's got to

6777
06:40:52,478 --> 06:40:54,558
be really well funded to go and build up

6778
06:40:54,558 --> 06:40:57,200
a ground station capability to intercept

6779
06:40:57,200 --> 06:41:00,320
your spacecraft on their own it's most

6780
06:41:00,320 --> 06:41:02,320
likely what someone's going to do is

6781
06:41:02,320 --> 06:41:04,080
attack an existing ground station a

6782
06:41:04,080 --> 06:41:06,478
private ground station or a cloud ground

6783
06:41:06,478 --> 06:41:07,840
station and pivot off that ground

6784
06:41:07,840 --> 06:41:09,200
station

6785
06:41:09,200 --> 06:41:12,638
to go up to the spacecraft this is going

6786
06:41:12,638 --> 06:41:15,920
to be probably the predominant vector

6787
06:41:15,920 --> 06:41:18,080
now this is what i found is extremely

6788
06:41:18,080 --> 06:41:19,680
interesting you know back in the years

6789
06:41:19,680 --> 06:41:21,360
ago everybody was talking about stux and

6790
06:41:21,360 --> 06:41:22,558
until we were sick of hearing about

6791
06:41:22,558 --> 06:41:23,680
stokes in it

6792
06:41:23,680 --> 06:41:25,440
well i'm going to bring up about stuxton

6793
06:41:25,440 --> 06:41:26,478
again

6794
06:41:26,478 --> 06:41:28,478
because uh because i found some a lot of

6795
06:41:28,478 --> 06:41:29,760
things and it was published that black

6796
06:41:29,760 --> 06:41:33,679
had a lot of articles on it

6797
06:41:33,760 --> 06:41:34,718
about

6798
06:41:34,718 --> 06:41:37,920
apparently when stuxnet got released and

6799
06:41:37,920 --> 06:41:39,840
got out into the wild apparently it

6800
06:41:39,840 --> 06:41:43,280
found its way into a cable tv network in

6801
06:41:43,280 --> 06:41:45,680
india and was and they were actually

6802
06:41:45,680 --> 06:41:47,360
using

6803
06:41:47,360 --> 06:41:48,160
the

6804
06:41:48,160 --> 06:41:50,638
same siemens plc controller in the wind

6805
06:41:50,638 --> 06:41:52,000
cc program

6806
06:41:52,000 --> 06:41:54,000
that stuxnet targeted and uh it has

6807
06:41:54,000 --> 06:41:55,600
actually targeted the satellite that it

6808
06:41:55,600 --> 06:41:58,240
was used to rotate the solar panels on

6809
06:41:58,240 --> 06:42:00,478
satellite apparently it fried it and

6810
06:42:00,478 --> 06:42:03,440
that's when it disabled that satellite

6811
06:42:03,440 --> 06:42:06,878
so i found out very interesting

6812
06:42:06,878 --> 06:42:08,558
now

6813
06:42:08,558 --> 06:42:10,000
i'm going back to school

6814
06:42:10,000 --> 06:42:12,000
to study space systems i got really

6815
06:42:12,000 --> 06:42:13,280
interested in space so i decided i'm

6816
06:42:13,280 --> 06:42:15,280
going to go back back and study

6817
06:42:15,280 --> 06:42:16,160
and

6818
06:42:16,160 --> 06:42:18,240
what i found really interesting is

6819
06:42:18,240 --> 06:42:20,558
there's uh all this space weather who

6820
06:42:20,558 --> 06:42:21,760
knew that their space weather you know

6821
06:42:21,760 --> 06:42:23,840
what was watching the weather on tv well

6822
06:42:23,840 --> 06:42:25,600
apparently there's a lot of weather out

6823
06:42:25,600 --> 06:42:28,718
in space and a lot of it's generated by

6824
06:42:28,718 --> 06:42:29,680
by

6825
06:42:29,680 --> 06:42:31,760
the sun so we have wind

6826
06:42:31,760 --> 06:42:33,680
we have all these solar flare solar

6827
06:42:33,680 --> 06:42:35,840
storms that are in space and it's

6828
06:42:35,840 --> 06:42:38,958
generating all kinds of protons and ions

6829
06:42:38,958 --> 06:42:41,200
and electrons and putting all kinds of

6830
06:42:41,200 --> 06:42:44,080
particles out in space and you measure

6831
06:42:44,080 --> 06:42:46,958
einstein's equation e equal m c square

6832
06:42:46,958 --> 06:42:50,160
was it was used to

6833
06:42:50,160 --> 06:42:53,120
to measure the energy of those small

6834
06:42:53,120 --> 06:42:55,920
particles that energy like of the uh

6835
06:42:55,920 --> 06:42:58,958
cosmic the cosmic rays that are being

6836
06:42:58,958 --> 06:43:01,200
shot through the

6837
06:43:01,200 --> 06:43:02,638
solar system

6838
06:43:02,638 --> 06:43:04,000
and

6839
06:43:04,000 --> 06:43:05,440
what i what i discovered during the

6840
06:43:05,440 --> 06:43:07,520
research and going to school

6841
06:43:07,520 --> 06:43:09,280
is that all these particles and things

6842
06:43:09,280 --> 06:43:10,558
over time

6843
06:43:10,558 --> 06:43:12,478
will deteriorate despite the materials

6844
06:43:12,478 --> 06:43:14,478
that the spacecraft is made of and not

6845
06:43:14,478 --> 06:43:16,638
only and not only will they deteriorate

6846
06:43:16,638 --> 06:43:18,478
the materials that this spacecraft is

6847
06:43:18,478 --> 06:43:20,558
made of actually doing like a uh a

6848
06:43:20,558 --> 06:43:22,478
chemical catalyst

6849
06:43:22,478 --> 06:43:24,638
and uh and

6850
06:43:24,638 --> 06:43:27,840
deteriorate over time depending on how

6851
06:43:27,840 --> 06:43:29,760
what materials were used

6852
06:43:29,760 --> 06:43:32,000
the chemical makeup of the materials it

6853
06:43:32,000 --> 06:43:34,320
could also affect the electronics

6854
06:43:34,320 --> 06:43:36,558
and uh and it caused disruption so i'm

6855
06:43:36,558 --> 06:43:37,920
referring that to

6856
06:43:37,920 --> 06:43:40,478
einstein denial of service

6857
06:43:40,478 --> 06:43:43,840
you heard it here first

6858
06:43:45,120 --> 06:43:47,440
but uh but but from a cyber standpoint

6859
06:43:47,440 --> 06:43:48,638
the reason you care from a cyber

6860
06:43:48,638 --> 06:43:50,878
standpoint is and this is the reason

6861
06:43:50,878 --> 06:43:52,638
that so much of the satellite

6862
06:43:52,638 --> 06:43:54,718
communications i discovered is not

6863
06:43:54,718 --> 06:43:56,400
really encrypted

6864
06:43:56,400 --> 06:43:58,958
because those particles that are those

6865
06:43:58,958 --> 06:44:00,878
ions and protons all that stuff that's

6866
06:44:00,878 --> 06:44:03,520
being spewed out in the space from the

6867
06:44:03,520 --> 06:44:04,320
sun

6868
06:44:04,320 --> 06:44:06,638
can cause what is called a single event

6869
06:44:06,638 --> 06:44:09,040
upset where it will flip bits in the

6870
06:44:09,040 --> 06:44:11,200
electronics and

6871
06:44:11,200 --> 06:44:13,280
and all you uh professionals that deal

6872
06:44:13,280 --> 06:44:16,000
with encryption you know that

6873
06:44:16,000 --> 06:44:18,638
the last thing we need is to have a you

6874
06:44:18,638 --> 06:44:21,040
know multi-million dollar spacecraft

6875
06:44:21,040 --> 06:44:23,280
in space and we've got encryption and

6876
06:44:23,280 --> 06:44:24,718
all of a sudden we start getting bits

6877
06:44:24,718 --> 06:44:28,160
flipped on our vpn encryption capability

6878
06:44:28,160 --> 06:44:30,080
and so we're going to lose sync

6879
06:44:30,080 --> 06:44:31,200
and then we're going to be trying to

6880
06:44:31,200 --> 06:44:33,040
sing back up and if we're in a solar

6881
06:44:33,040 --> 06:44:34,000
storm

6882
06:44:34,000 --> 06:44:35,200
and have you know there's a lot of

6883
06:44:35,200 --> 06:44:37,200
activities the sun's like here recently

6884
06:44:37,200 --> 06:44:38,798
been very active

6885
06:44:38,798 --> 06:44:40,638
with the solar flares

6886
06:44:40,638 --> 06:44:42,798
we could lose communications

6887
06:44:42,798 --> 06:44:44,958
with our device because we're constantly

6888
06:44:44,958 --> 06:44:47,920
trying to re-sync our encryption keys so

6889
06:44:47,920 --> 06:44:49,520
that is the reason

6890
06:44:49,520 --> 06:44:51,600
that a lot of the spacecraft especially

6891
06:44:51,600 --> 06:44:53,600
the low-cost spacecraft

6892
06:44:53,600 --> 06:44:56,240
are not uh using encryption

6893
06:44:56,240 --> 06:44:58,638
because because to use encryption they

6894
06:44:58,638 --> 06:45:01,040
would have to use radiation hardening

6895
06:45:01,040 --> 06:45:03,760
equipment have to get it have to improve

6896
06:45:03,760 --> 06:45:05,200
the

6897
06:45:05,200 --> 06:45:07,440
the materials that are protecting the

6898
06:45:07,440 --> 06:45:08,320
chips

6899
06:45:08,320 --> 06:45:09,680
so that they would not lose the

6900
06:45:09,680 --> 06:45:12,320
connectivity so to drive down the cost

6901
06:45:12,320 --> 06:45:13,120
the

6902
06:45:13,120 --> 06:45:14,718
they assume the risk of not using

6903
06:45:14,718 --> 06:45:17,200
encryption

6904
06:45:18,878 --> 06:45:21,280
and so as you well know if we don't have

6905
06:45:21,280 --> 06:45:22,878
encryption it's like plugging into the

6906
06:45:22,878 --> 06:45:25,680
hotel wi-fi if it ain't encrypted and

6907
06:45:25,680 --> 06:45:28,400
you're on the wi-fi we all can we always

6908
06:45:28,400 --> 06:45:30,320
all we have to do is uh lock into your

6909
06:45:30,320 --> 06:45:33,280
channel and pull up some wireshark and

6910
06:45:33,280 --> 06:45:34,478
start capturing your traffic it's a

6911
06:45:34,478 --> 06:45:35,760
little it's more involved with a

6912
06:45:35,760 --> 06:45:38,320
satellite with the equipment is is a low

6913
06:45:38,320 --> 06:45:40,400
cost get you a software-defined radio

6914
06:45:40,400 --> 06:45:42,000
you know get the equipment you know

6915
06:45:42,000 --> 06:45:45,840
nominal cost and you can lock in and get

6916
06:45:45,840 --> 06:45:48,080
your dish and you can lock in and pull

6917
06:45:48,080 --> 06:45:50,240
satellite communications off the air

6918
06:45:50,240 --> 06:45:52,160
unencrypted

6919
06:45:52,160 --> 06:45:54,400
and it's and it's all documented out on

6920
06:45:54,400 --> 06:45:55,680
the internet so it just takes a little

6921
06:45:55,680 --> 06:45:58,080
bit of work small budget to make that

6922
06:45:58,080 --> 06:45:59,840
happen so you can passively sit there in

6923
06:45:59,840 --> 06:46:01,440
unencrypted

6924
06:46:01,440 --> 06:46:03,120
capture network traffic

6925
06:46:03,120 --> 06:46:05,120
i know a software engineer where i live

6926
06:46:05,120 --> 06:46:07,120
that

6927
06:46:07,120 --> 06:46:08,160
no background he's not a

6928
06:46:08,160 --> 06:46:10,798
telecommunications person he's not a

6929
06:46:10,798 --> 06:46:12,638
cyber security person just a good

6930
06:46:12,638 --> 06:46:14,400
software person

6931
06:46:14,400 --> 06:46:15,360
went and

6932
06:46:15,360 --> 06:46:18,000
made this happen with using a home uh

6933
06:46:18,000 --> 06:46:20,878
satellite dish very very little effort

6934
06:46:20,878 --> 06:46:23,840
and uh it's totally ripping uh

6935
06:46:23,840 --> 06:46:25,680
packets apart coming off of satellite

6936
06:46:25,680 --> 06:46:27,440
coms

6937
06:46:27,440 --> 06:46:28,478
because it's out there just being

6938
06:46:28,478 --> 06:46:30,478
multicast out on there so here's a

6939
06:46:30,478 --> 06:46:32,240
here's a real world example of

6940
06:46:32,240 --> 06:46:34,638
unencrypted communications uh there was

6941
06:46:34,638 --> 06:46:37,120
a navy satellite

6942
06:46:37,120 --> 06:46:38,798
that that the navy was using for

6943
06:46:38,798 --> 06:46:41,440
communications and apparently some real

6944
06:46:41,440 --> 06:46:43,840
innovative individuals uh in the radio

6945
06:46:43,840 --> 06:46:44,878
community

6946
06:46:44,878 --> 06:46:46,798
uh discovered that that the satellite

6947
06:46:46,798 --> 06:46:48,400
was used in open communications and so

6948
06:46:48,400 --> 06:46:50,400
they turned it into a cb radio network

6949
06:46:50,400 --> 06:46:52,718
for themselves

6950
06:46:52,718 --> 06:46:54,478
and uh and they were

6951
06:46:54,478 --> 06:46:56,478
apparently you could

6952
06:46:56,478 --> 06:46:59,200
it was disrupting uh stealing resources

6953
06:46:59,200 --> 06:47:02,478
from uh the navy's mission so

6954
06:47:02,478 --> 06:47:06,000
by the time they uh start started uh

6955
06:47:06,000 --> 06:47:07,840
doing investigations and all and

6956
06:47:07,840 --> 06:47:09,360
arresting people they arrested ended up

6957
06:47:09,360 --> 06:47:12,160
arresting 39 people across six states in

6958
06:47:12,160 --> 06:47:13,280
brazil

6959
06:47:13,280 --> 06:47:14,718
and my understanding is about the time

6960
06:47:14,718 --> 06:47:16,400
they started getting everybody arrested

6961
06:47:16,400 --> 06:47:18,320
other people started using it

6962
06:47:18,320 --> 06:47:20,320
because it's unencrypted

6963
06:47:20,320 --> 06:47:21,840
so

6964
06:47:21,840 --> 06:47:24,000
so there's one example here's a here's

6965
06:47:24,000 --> 06:47:26,160
another real example of proves that

6966
06:47:26,160 --> 06:47:28,160
things are not encrypted

6967
06:47:28,160 --> 06:47:29,120
you know

6968
06:47:29,120 --> 06:47:31,040
if you like like i say if you need it

6969
06:47:31,040 --> 06:47:32,558
secure you better go and put your own

6970
06:47:32,558 --> 06:47:34,958
overlay network it's kind of like a

6971
06:47:34,958 --> 06:47:38,718
some research i did on mpls vpns a few

6972
06:47:38,718 --> 06:47:41,120
years ago where everyone assumes that

6973
06:47:41,120 --> 06:47:44,878
vpn means a virtual private network and

6974
06:47:44,878 --> 06:47:46,558
implies encryption

6975
06:47:46,558 --> 06:47:49,120
vpn does not imply encryption and just

6976
06:47:49,120 --> 06:47:50,558
because you're using a satellite com

6977
06:47:50,558 --> 06:47:52,000
doesn't imply that somebody is

6978
06:47:52,000 --> 06:47:54,320
encrypting that satellite for you

6979
06:47:54,320 --> 06:47:56,798
because it's just not and so in this

6980
06:47:56,798 --> 06:47:58,160
example

6981
06:47:58,160 --> 06:47:59,760
there was some malware that was focused

6982
06:47:59,760 --> 06:48:02,718
on southern europe the middle east north

6983
06:48:02,718 --> 06:48:04,320
africa region

6984
06:48:04,320 --> 06:48:05,680
and

6985
06:48:05,680 --> 06:48:07,840
what the malware would do is a user

6986
06:48:07,840 --> 06:48:10,240
would get infected

6987
06:48:10,240 --> 06:48:11,680
and

6988
06:48:11,680 --> 06:48:12,558
the

6989
06:48:12,558 --> 06:48:14,160
the c2 server

6990
06:48:14,160 --> 06:48:17,120
was located on the satellite network it

6991
06:48:17,120 --> 06:48:18,958
was set up on a

6992
06:48:18,958 --> 06:48:20,798
to receive satellite communications and

6993
06:48:20,798 --> 06:48:22,718
it would just go and use somebody's ip

6994
06:48:22,718 --> 06:48:26,478
address in that satellite network

6995
06:48:26,478 --> 06:48:28,478
and and so an end user would get

6996
06:48:28,478 --> 06:48:29,680
infected

6997
06:48:29,680 --> 06:48:31,200
and when they got infected they'd phone

6998
06:48:31,200 --> 06:48:33,760
home it would phone it would go and send

6999
06:48:33,760 --> 06:48:37,280
its phone home message to the c2 server

7000
06:48:37,280 --> 06:48:39,920
on the satellite network and then the

7001
06:48:39,920 --> 06:48:40,638
the

7002
06:48:40,638 --> 06:48:42,160
c2 server

7003
06:48:42,160 --> 06:48:43,920
would send the response back to that

7004
06:48:43,920 --> 06:48:47,120
infected device over a fixed wire line

7005
06:48:47,120 --> 06:48:48,000
so

7006
06:48:48,000 --> 06:48:49,520
one part of the communication would come

7007
06:48:49,520 --> 06:48:50,798
in over the

7008
06:48:50,798 --> 06:48:52,958
satellite broadcast and then another

7009
06:48:52,958 --> 06:48:55,760
connection would go the response would

7010
06:48:55,760 --> 06:48:57,920
go over the wire line so it was an async

7011
06:48:57,920 --> 06:48:59,840
so if you're a threat hunter and there's

7012
06:48:59,840 --> 06:49:02,160
a lot of blue team folks here a lot of

7013
06:49:02,160 --> 06:49:04,160
threat hunters it'd be really hard to go

7014
06:49:04,160 --> 06:49:05,360
and chase that one down where the

7015
06:49:05,360 --> 06:49:07,200
connection is coming off of one part of

7016
06:49:07,200 --> 06:49:08,320
the connection is coming off of a

7017
06:49:08,320 --> 06:49:09,920
satellite broadcast

7018
06:49:09,920 --> 06:49:12,478
going to some somebody some user's ip

7019
06:49:12,478 --> 06:49:14,000
address out in

7020
06:49:14,000 --> 06:49:16,958
out in that geographic region and then

7021
06:49:16,958 --> 06:49:18,958
the return portion of the communication

7022
06:49:18,958 --> 06:49:20,878
is going over a wire line that would two

7023
06:49:20,878 --> 06:49:22,478
totally different service providers

7024
06:49:22,478 --> 06:49:24,000
really harder to

7025
06:49:24,000 --> 06:49:25,760
tie that one down

7026
06:49:25,760 --> 06:49:27,760
but that would not be that would not be

7027
06:49:27,760 --> 06:49:30,080
uh happening if the communication was

7028
06:49:30,080 --> 06:49:31,440
encrypted

7029
06:49:31,440 --> 06:49:33,840
so for

7030
06:49:34,000 --> 06:49:36,400
another example was uh that was proven

7031
06:49:36,400 --> 06:49:39,040
out was in the news back in 2009 was

7032
06:49:39,040 --> 06:49:41,440
with uh with satellite video

7033
06:49:41,440 --> 06:49:43,280
communication in the

7034
06:49:43,280 --> 06:49:45,600
the gulf war

7035
06:49:45,600 --> 06:49:48,240
in iraq was uh captured

7036
06:49:48,240 --> 06:49:50,878
unencrypted

7037
06:49:51,280 --> 06:49:54,878
now i mentioned this earlier

7038
06:49:55,280 --> 06:49:57,040
at some point with all the satellites

7039
06:49:57,040 --> 06:49:58,638
being put up in space and everybody's

7040
06:49:58,638 --> 06:50:00,478
doing internet all the

7041
06:50:00,478 --> 06:50:02,958
the internet in space and things right

7042
06:50:02,958 --> 06:50:03,680
now

7043
06:50:03,680 --> 06:50:05,520
majority of the satellites are using

7044
06:50:05,520 --> 06:50:08,160
proprietary or specialized protocols

7045
06:50:08,160 --> 06:50:09,120
legacy

7046
06:50:09,120 --> 06:50:10,958
satellite protocols

7047
06:50:10,958 --> 06:50:12,478
that have been in place for many years

7048
06:50:12,478 --> 06:50:14,400
they're trusted but things are quickly

7049
06:50:14,400 --> 06:50:17,200
moving the ip ipv4 and ipv6 are being

7050
06:50:17,200 --> 06:50:20,080
used in space and things move more and

7051
06:50:20,080 --> 06:50:21,680
more to

7052
06:50:21,680 --> 06:50:23,760
ip and all this new infrastructure is

7053
06:50:23,760 --> 06:50:25,920
moving into space with all the cubesats

7054
06:50:25,920 --> 06:50:28,878
and nanosats and all the other satellite

7055
06:50:28,878 --> 06:50:30,478
services that are being deployed in

7056
06:50:30,478 --> 06:50:32,400
space at some point someone is going to

7057
06:50:32,400 --> 06:50:34,000
figure out how to do a satellite

7058
06:50:34,000 --> 06:50:36,478
satellite hack

7059
06:50:36,478 --> 06:50:38,400
like right now it's totally theoretical

7060
06:50:38,400 --> 06:50:40,718
but what i found really interesting is

7061
06:50:40,718 --> 06:50:42,798
most the communications right now are rf

7062
06:50:42,798 --> 06:50:45,040
radio frequency communications from the

7063
06:50:45,040 --> 06:50:47,280
spacecraft to the ground and satellite

7064
06:50:47,280 --> 06:50:49,600
the satellite is over radio frequency

7065
06:50:49,600 --> 06:50:51,520
but it's moving to optical which is

7066
06:50:51,520 --> 06:50:54,400
going to be a whole lot harder to

7067
06:50:54,400 --> 06:50:55,920
intercept when things start going to

7068
06:50:55,920 --> 06:50:58,080
free space optics

7069
06:50:58,080 --> 06:50:59,040
for

7070
06:50:59,040 --> 06:51:00,080
communication so it's going to be

7071
06:51:00,080 --> 06:51:02,000
interesting how this all evolves

7072
06:51:02,000 --> 06:51:05,360
but i won't put it on your radar

7073
06:51:07,120 --> 06:51:09,520
so for some examples of real world hacks

7074
06:51:09,520 --> 06:51:11,120
that have happened i was really

7075
06:51:11,120 --> 06:51:12,400
surprised as i started doing this

7076
06:51:12,400 --> 06:51:15,840
research i had no idea so many

7077
06:51:15,840 --> 06:51:17,520
so much had actually really happened

7078
06:51:17,520 --> 06:51:19,840
real world in 1998 there was a the u.s

7079
06:51:19,840 --> 06:51:23,120
german uh satellite rosat

7080
06:51:23,120 --> 06:51:26,400
that was uh the ground station

7081
06:51:26,400 --> 06:51:27,680
got hacked

7082
06:51:27,680 --> 06:51:29,520
and from that ground station

7083
06:51:29,520 --> 06:51:31,440
the satellite was hacked through that

7084
06:51:31,440 --> 06:51:33,680
trust relationship since it's kind of

7085
06:51:33,680 --> 06:51:34,798
like a network management system

7086
06:51:34,798 --> 06:51:35,920
somebody's going to break into your

7087
06:51:35,920 --> 06:51:37,920
router easiest way to hack the router is

7088
06:51:37,920 --> 06:51:39,680
to hack the network management system

7089
06:51:39,680 --> 06:51:42,080
first well the ground station in this

7090
06:51:42,080 --> 06:51:44,478
case that controls the satellite guy got

7091
06:51:44,478 --> 06:51:46,000
attacked and they were able to take

7092
06:51:46,000 --> 06:51:47,760
control of the satellite and then turn

7093
06:51:47,760 --> 06:51:49,920
the satellite so that it pointed toward

7094
06:51:49,920 --> 06:51:51,600
the sun

7095
06:51:51,600 --> 06:51:52,400
and

7096
06:51:52,400 --> 06:51:53,680
burned up the

7097
06:51:53,680 --> 06:51:56,080
capability

7098
06:51:56,080 --> 06:51:58,958
for that satellite

7099
06:52:00,400 --> 06:52:02,440
then in uh

7100
06:52:02,440 --> 06:52:04,478
2007-2008 there was the landsat

7101
06:52:04,478 --> 06:52:07,200
satellite that someone hacked

7102
06:52:07,200 --> 06:52:09,200
most likely they got through a trusted

7103
06:52:09,200 --> 06:52:11,840
ground station

7104
06:52:11,840 --> 06:52:12,958
and

7105
06:52:12,958 --> 06:52:16,240
they had they had control of it

7106
06:52:16,240 --> 06:52:19,200
for 12 minutes in this case

7107
06:52:19,200 --> 06:52:21,760
and what what was published is they had

7108
06:52:21,760 --> 06:52:24,000
the attackers had total control of the

7109
06:52:24,000 --> 06:52:26,320
satellite but they apparently didn't

7110
06:52:26,320 --> 06:52:28,478
know what they how to manage the

7111
06:52:28,478 --> 06:52:30,400
satellite and one things i've discovered

7112
06:52:30,400 --> 06:52:32,798
during some other research is there is a

7113
06:52:32,798 --> 06:52:34,878
really long list

7114
06:52:34,878 --> 06:52:37,120
of space protocols

7115
06:52:37,120 --> 06:52:38,160
space

7116
06:52:38,160 --> 06:52:40,240
satellite command languages

7117
06:52:40,240 --> 06:52:42,958
and satellite operating systems

7118
06:52:42,958 --> 06:52:44,958
there's a really long list of each one

7119
06:52:44,958 --> 06:52:46,798
of those the protocols the operating

7120
06:52:46,798 --> 06:52:50,638
systems and the interface languages so i

7121
06:52:50,638 --> 06:52:52,558
my thought is is whoever the adversary

7122
06:52:52,558 --> 06:52:54,718
was that got onto those satellites

7123
06:52:54,718 --> 06:52:56,558
maybe they got they got the access to

7124
06:52:56,558 --> 06:52:58,558
the ground station but once they got on

7125
06:52:58,558 --> 06:53:00,958
the spacecraft they didn't know the

7126
06:53:00,958 --> 06:53:02,798
language syntax

7127
06:53:02,798 --> 06:53:04,080
kind of like me

7128
06:53:04,080 --> 06:53:06,240
being a windows unix person getting on

7129
06:53:06,240 --> 06:53:09,360
an old vax vms or a mainframe system i

7130
06:53:09,360 --> 06:53:11,040
may have gotten access but i have no

7131
06:53:11,040 --> 06:53:13,680
idea what i'm doing with an as400 or

7132
06:53:13,680 --> 06:53:17,200
mainframe or vms box that's you know

7133
06:53:17,200 --> 06:53:18,798
because i don't know the language the uh

7134
06:53:18,798 --> 06:53:20,798
the cli the command language

7135
06:53:20,798 --> 06:53:23,040
so that's that's my thoughts on what

7136
06:53:23,040 --> 06:53:24,638
probably happened here with this landsat

7137
06:53:24,638 --> 06:53:26,400
7

7138
06:53:26,400 --> 06:53:29,760
uh similar was uh the terrace satellite

7139
06:53:29,760 --> 06:53:32,958
they had com the adversary had complete

7140
06:53:32,958 --> 06:53:35,040
control of the satellite

7141
06:53:35,040 --> 06:53:37,040
they had the access

7142
06:53:37,040 --> 06:53:39,120
they had the access to do whatever they

7143
06:53:39,120 --> 06:53:40,160
wanted

7144
06:53:40,160 --> 06:53:43,040
on two different occasions in 2008 but

7145
06:53:43,040 --> 06:53:46,000
they apparently again similarly to the

7146
06:53:46,000 --> 06:53:48,558
landsat satellite they though they had

7147
06:53:48,558 --> 06:53:50,718
the access

7148
06:53:50,718 --> 06:53:53,520
they uh then were not able to execute

7149
06:53:53,520 --> 06:53:56,320
commands to do anything like deorbited

7150
06:53:56,320 --> 06:53:57,920
or something you know or turn it towards

7151
06:53:57,920 --> 06:53:58,798
the sun

7152
06:53:58,798 --> 06:54:00,958
in this case

7153
06:54:00,958 --> 06:54:03,280
so security by obscurity worked in those

7154
06:54:03,280 --> 06:54:05,680
cases

7155
06:54:06,478 --> 06:54:08,160
uh but here's a

7156
06:54:08,160 --> 06:54:10,320
in this case in the there was a noaa

7157
06:54:10,320 --> 06:54:12,478
weather satellite in this case it was

7158
06:54:12,478 --> 06:54:14,080
attributed to the chinese that they were

7159
06:54:14,080 --> 06:54:16,160
actually able to take full control of

7160
06:54:16,160 --> 06:54:18,240
the satellite but then

7161
06:54:18,240 --> 06:54:20,718
the access was taken back control of the

7162
06:54:20,718 --> 06:54:23,440
satellite was taken back and

7163
06:54:23,440 --> 06:54:24,840
then they were removed from the

7164
06:54:24,840 --> 06:54:28,240
satellite but in this case they

7165
06:54:28,240 --> 06:54:30,240
they had control of it from what i might

7166
06:54:30,240 --> 06:54:32,638
understand

7167
06:54:34,000 --> 06:54:34,958
this one was really interesting

7168
06:54:34,958 --> 06:54:36,798
everybody's talking about ransomware

7169
06:54:36,798 --> 06:54:39,760
but there was apparently like

7170
06:54:39,760 --> 06:54:42,240
in 99 a satellite

7171
06:54:42,240 --> 06:54:43,600
for skynet

7172
06:54:43,600 --> 06:54:44,798
in the uk

7173
06:54:44,798 --> 06:54:47,120
the military they have uh have four

7174
06:54:47,120 --> 06:54:50,160
satellites that are comprised they build

7175
06:54:50,160 --> 06:54:53,120
uh the skynet constellation and one of

7176
06:54:53,120 --> 06:54:54,558
the four apparently

7177
06:54:54,558 --> 06:54:57,680
was uh hacked and held for ransom

7178
06:54:57,680 --> 06:54:59,040
so i found that really interesting with

7179
06:54:59,040 --> 06:55:00,400
everyone talking about ransomware these

7180
06:55:00,400 --> 06:55:01,840
days in the news

7181
06:55:01,840 --> 06:55:03,440
back in 99 a satellite was held for

7182
06:55:03,440 --> 06:55:05,840
ransom so and with all the satellites

7183
06:55:05,840 --> 06:55:07,920
that are being launched into space a lot

7184
06:55:07,920 --> 06:55:10,240
of the new satellites are linux based

7185
06:55:10,240 --> 06:55:13,200
running raspberry pi's beagle bones like

7186
06:55:13,200 --> 06:55:15,600
a little piece of trivia fire you really

7187
06:55:15,600 --> 06:55:17,760
realize uh that when

7188
06:55:17,760 --> 06:55:20,240
starlink spacex and starlink when they

7189
06:55:20,240 --> 06:55:21,280
launch a

7190
06:55:21,280 --> 06:55:23,760
rocket with 28 satellites

7191
06:55:23,760 --> 06:55:26,638
i was reading that a a rocket with 28

7192
06:55:26,638 --> 06:55:28,400
starlink satellites has

7193
06:55:28,400 --> 06:55:31,760
4 000 linux computers on it that's a lot

7194
06:55:31,760 --> 06:55:32,878
of linux

7195
06:55:32,878 --> 06:55:33,920
now

7196
06:55:33,920 --> 06:55:35,680
it's they do a really good job of

7197
06:55:35,680 --> 06:55:38,400
securing and hardening their systems but

7198
06:55:38,400 --> 06:55:40,240
if someone was to ever figure out how to

7199
06:55:40,240 --> 06:55:41,680
go and do some kind of piece of

7200
06:55:41,680 --> 06:55:44,320
ransomware uh malware and get it into

7201
06:55:44,320 --> 06:55:46,958
that that linens kernel that would make

7202
06:55:46,958 --> 06:55:49,360
a pretty interesting ransomware attack

7203
06:55:49,360 --> 06:55:51,360
to get ransomware in space can't help

7204
06:55:51,360 --> 06:55:53,360
but wonder you know at some point with

7205
06:55:53,360 --> 06:55:55,280
everything moving to open source in

7206
06:55:55,280 --> 06:55:56,478
space

7207
06:55:56,478 --> 06:55:58,080
uh you know ip

7208
06:55:58,080 --> 06:56:01,280
version 4 ipv6 linux at some point are

7209
06:56:01,280 --> 06:56:03,360
we going to see maybe a ransomware

7210
06:56:03,360 --> 06:56:04,878
attack in space

7211
06:56:04,878 --> 06:56:06,400
with some of these new satellite

7212
06:56:06,400 --> 06:56:09,680
constellations that are going up

7213
06:56:11,040 --> 06:56:13,920
another example of malware in space

7214
06:56:13,920 --> 06:56:16,638
is there

7215
06:56:16,638 --> 06:56:18,638
two times uh two events that i'm aware

7216
06:56:18,638 --> 06:56:20,798
of were

7217
06:56:20,798 --> 06:56:22,958
russian cosmonauts working on the space

7218
06:56:22,958 --> 06:56:25,360
station accidentally unintentionally

7219
06:56:25,360 --> 06:56:28,000
infected systems on the space station

7220
06:56:28,000 --> 06:56:29,120
once by

7221
06:56:29,120 --> 06:56:32,798
usb thumb drive and uh through a windows

7222
06:56:32,798 --> 06:56:35,600
laptop that had malware embroidering the

7223
06:56:35,600 --> 06:56:38,478
space station now the network there was

7224
06:56:38,478 --> 06:56:40,400
infected on the space station was not

7225
06:56:40,400 --> 06:56:43,760
the the flight control system it did not

7226
06:56:43,760 --> 06:56:44,718
threaten

7227
06:56:44,718 --> 06:56:48,160
the flight system for the space station

7228
06:56:48,160 --> 06:56:50,240
apparently wasn't on a sensitive network

7229
06:56:50,240 --> 06:56:51,600
the same you know control the

7230
06:56:51,600 --> 06:56:54,718
environmental systems etc but it was

7231
06:56:54,718 --> 06:56:57,440
there was an infection on in the network

7232
06:56:57,440 --> 06:56:59,280
uh

7233
06:56:59,280 --> 06:57:01,840
so

7234
06:57:02,798 --> 06:57:05,120
well there's a great deal

7235
06:57:05,120 --> 06:57:07,280
of work being done in the field of cyber

7236
06:57:07,280 --> 06:57:09,680
security for space there's an

7237
06:57:09,680 --> 06:57:10,798
international organization the

7238
06:57:10,798 --> 06:57:13,040
consultative committee for space data

7239
06:57:13,040 --> 06:57:14,878
systems that's an it's an international

7240
06:57:14,878 --> 06:57:16,160
organization lots of countries

7241
06:57:16,160 --> 06:57:18,638
contribute to it the standards and best

7242
06:57:18,638 --> 06:57:20,478
practices for security

7243
06:57:20,478 --> 06:57:22,320
and uh protocols encryption are

7244
06:57:22,320 --> 06:57:24,400
published just like it is for our

7245
06:57:24,400 --> 06:57:26,160
enterprise and service provider

7246
06:57:26,160 --> 06:57:28,320
telecommunications networks but like

7247
06:57:28,320 --> 06:57:29,600
everything else

7248
06:57:29,600 --> 06:57:31,360
it's out there we've got to go and use

7249
06:57:31,360 --> 06:57:34,240
it and implement it and do the uh

7250
06:57:34,240 --> 06:57:36,478
systems engineering

7251
06:57:36,478 --> 06:57:38,160
but a lot of times the trade stud the

7252
06:57:38,160 --> 06:57:40,320
system engineer trace studies have been

7253
06:57:40,320 --> 06:57:42,160
done and the risk has been assumed

7254
06:57:42,160 --> 06:57:43,680
because in

7255
06:57:43,680 --> 06:57:45,760
radiation hardening to protect the

7256
06:57:45,760 --> 06:57:48,160
encryption costs money so it just isn't

7257
06:57:48,160 --> 06:57:50,240
implemented but the standards

7258
06:57:50,240 --> 06:57:52,558
the best practices are published but you

7259
06:57:52,558 --> 06:57:54,160
know

7260
06:57:54,160 --> 06:57:56,080
somebody's got to use it build it in

7261
06:57:56,080 --> 06:57:58,558
build it into the budget

7262
06:57:58,558 --> 06:58:00,320
well

7263
06:58:00,320 --> 06:58:01,840
don't try to read this live i just

7264
06:58:01,840 --> 06:58:03,760
wanted but uh but i wanted to make sure

7265
06:58:03,760 --> 06:58:05,360
it's available in case anyone wants to

7266
06:58:05,360 --> 06:58:07,360
slide these are the current best

7267
06:58:07,360 --> 06:58:09,520
practices that i'm aware of they're out

7268
06:58:09,520 --> 06:58:12,160
there nist in the last year has pushed

7269
06:58:12,160 --> 06:58:14,718
out a couple uh new standards for

7270
06:58:14,718 --> 06:58:17,200
commercial satellites and for ground

7271
06:58:17,200 --> 06:58:20,878
stations there's a nist 8270

7272
06:58:20,878 --> 06:58:21,718
and

7273
06:58:21,718 --> 06:58:24,958
8401 from nist if you're interested in

7274
06:58:24,958 --> 06:58:27,840
this i would check out

7275
06:58:28,320 --> 06:58:30,638
there's a

7276
06:58:30,638 --> 06:58:32,958
aerospace corporation

7277
06:58:32,958 --> 06:58:34,160
modder

7278
06:58:34,160 --> 06:58:36,718
mit lincoln labs

7279
06:58:36,718 --> 06:58:39,600
noaa

7280
06:58:39,600 --> 06:58:42,798
and also recently uh cesa and nsa have

7281
06:58:42,798 --> 06:58:45,360
put out best practices for securing uh

7282
06:58:45,360 --> 06:58:48,160
satellite communications for

7283
06:58:48,160 --> 06:58:50,000
so the the standards are being put out

7284
06:58:50,000 --> 06:58:52,080
there there's the orbital alliance that

7285
06:58:52,080 --> 06:58:53,280
put it that's put out some best

7286
06:58:53,280 --> 06:58:55,760
practices for commercial space so

7287
06:58:55,760 --> 06:58:57,600
there's there's good there's good

7288
06:58:57,600 --> 06:58:59,040
information being put out there about

7289
06:58:59,040 --> 06:59:01,600
how to harden these networks both for uh

7290
06:59:01,600 --> 06:59:03,680
users for the user terminal all the way

7291
06:59:03,680 --> 06:59:05,440
to the ground station and the satellite

7292
06:59:05,440 --> 06:59:06,878
as they're being developed so if you

7293
06:59:06,878 --> 06:59:08,638
work for a university the the best

7294
06:59:08,638 --> 06:59:10,240
practices and information to get these

7295
06:59:10,240 --> 06:59:12,320
systems hardened to protect them so you

7296
06:59:12,320 --> 06:59:14,400
can maintain control are out there and

7297
06:59:14,400 --> 06:59:16,000
if you want the slides with all these

7298
06:59:16,000 --> 06:59:17,440
links and everything i'll be happy to

7299
06:59:17,440 --> 06:59:19,040
provide it to you just hit me up and

7300
06:59:19,040 --> 06:59:21,840
i'll give it to you

7301
06:59:22,080 --> 06:59:24,958
my recommendations is is

7302
06:59:24,958 --> 06:59:26,478
everybody's talking about devsecops we

7303
06:59:26,478 --> 06:59:28,320
need to get devsecops

7304
06:59:28,320 --> 06:59:29,920
in the space business because we're

7305
06:59:29,920 --> 06:59:32,080
going to build what they call space 2.0

7306
06:59:32,080 --> 06:59:33,600
all these new systems it needs to be

7307
06:59:33,600 --> 06:59:35,680
hardened it's great that we're using all

7308
06:59:35,680 --> 06:59:37,600
the open source tools and we're getting

7309
06:59:37,600 --> 06:59:40,000
away from uh you know uh

7310
06:59:40,000 --> 06:59:42,958
old proprietary uh

7311
06:59:42,958 --> 06:59:45,680
obscure protocols and operating systems

7312
06:59:45,680 --> 06:59:47,600
but as we move we need to go and start

7313
06:59:47,600 --> 06:59:49,360
building them devsecops from the very

7314
06:59:49,360 --> 06:59:51,520
beginning and monitor that supply chain

7315
06:59:51,520 --> 06:59:53,920
and lock down those trust relationships

7316
06:59:53,920 --> 06:59:55,520
especially as things are moving to the

7317
06:59:55,520 --> 06:59:56,718
cloud it's going to be really important

7318
06:59:56,718 --> 06:59:59,520
to lock those trust relationships down

7319
06:59:59,520 --> 07:00:01,920
and protect against what i call the vpt

7320
07:00:01,920 --> 07:00:03,920
the vendor persistent threat don't let

7321
07:00:03,920 --> 07:00:06,000
these vendors go and put in uh back

7322
07:00:06,000 --> 07:00:08,558
doors for their remote access that are

7323
07:00:08,558 --> 07:00:10,638
have weak authentication it turns around

7324
07:00:10,638 --> 07:00:12,320
enabling someone to help us start

7325
07:00:12,320 --> 07:00:14,840
managing our spacecraft

7326
07:00:14,840 --> 07:00:18,080
but and what i've the one thing i'm

7327
07:00:18,080 --> 07:00:20,320
really excited about interesting to see

7328
07:00:20,320 --> 07:00:21,680
is

7329
07:00:21,680 --> 07:00:24,080
is the implementation of intrusion

7330
07:00:24,080 --> 07:00:26,638
prevention systems and logging

7331
07:00:26,638 --> 07:00:28,798
capabilities actually being put on

7332
07:00:28,798 --> 07:00:30,638
satellites there's a big push now with

7333
07:00:30,638 --> 07:00:32,798
satellites to be developed with

7334
07:00:32,798 --> 07:00:34,400
software-defined it's called a

7335
07:00:34,400 --> 07:00:36,240
software-defined satellite

7336
07:00:36,240 --> 07:00:37,040
where

7337
07:00:37,040 --> 07:00:38,718
the satellite capabilities are being

7338
07:00:38,718 --> 07:00:41,120
virtualized so the payload all those

7339
07:00:41,120 --> 07:00:43,520
systems can be virtualized running vms

7340
07:00:43,520 --> 07:00:45,440
as well as containers

7341
07:00:45,440 --> 07:00:47,120
and so if you can run if you can start

7342
07:00:47,120 --> 07:00:49,200
running vms and you can run containers

7343
07:00:49,200 --> 07:00:51,840
why can't we have a vm a container with

7344
07:00:51,840 --> 07:00:54,160
security capabilities maybe applying

7345
07:00:54,160 --> 07:00:56,400
machine learning and ai capabilities to

7346
07:00:56,400 --> 07:00:58,718
monitor the commands that are being sent

7347
07:00:58,718 --> 07:01:01,600
we already know what the time sequence

7348
07:01:01,600 --> 07:01:03,600
and the sequence of commands that we

7349
07:01:03,600 --> 07:01:05,360
traditionally will be sending to our

7350
07:01:05,360 --> 07:01:08,878
spacecraft so if we uh if we know how

7351
07:01:08,878 --> 07:01:11,040
we're going to operate

7352
07:01:11,040 --> 07:01:13,040
and that's the time sequence and the

7353
07:01:13,040 --> 07:01:15,440
delay we expect the order of certain

7354
07:01:15,440 --> 07:01:18,240
commands and operations we can go and

7355
07:01:18,240 --> 07:01:20,638
baseline that this should be pretty easy

7356
07:01:20,638 --> 07:01:23,040
uh with low overhead to apply machine

7357
07:01:23,040 --> 07:01:24,958
learning ai techniques to quickly

7358
07:01:24,958 --> 07:01:27,600
identify some kind of anomaly happening

7359
07:01:27,600 --> 07:01:29,840
in the network and hey flag hey

7360
07:01:29,840 --> 07:01:31,040
somebody's trying to help us run the

7361
07:01:31,040 --> 07:01:33,200
network the spacecraft now and since

7362
07:01:33,200 --> 07:01:34,958
we're running containers and vms and

7363
07:01:34,958 --> 07:01:37,920
things maybe we can if we start needing

7364
07:01:37,920 --> 07:01:40,240
to do instant response we can revert

7365
07:01:40,240 --> 07:01:42,400
back to a known good configuration a

7366
07:01:42,400 --> 07:01:45,280
known good container and no good vm

7367
07:01:45,280 --> 07:01:47,440
until we can do root cause analysis of

7368
07:01:47,440 --> 07:01:48,958
what's happening

7369
07:01:48,958 --> 07:01:51,680
to the system

7370
07:01:52,240 --> 07:01:55,120
uh now when as i started doing uh

7371
07:01:55,120 --> 07:01:57,360
research on this one things i was really

7372
07:01:57,360 --> 07:01:59,680
happy to discover is there is a lot of

7373
07:01:59,680 --> 07:02:02,080
open source capabilities out there so if

7374
07:02:02,080 --> 07:02:03,600
you want to learn space you want to

7375
07:02:03,600 --> 07:02:05,600
learn satellite systems maybe

7376
07:02:05,600 --> 07:02:08,080
for yourself for your company or you

7377
07:02:08,080 --> 07:02:10,240
want to take it back to your university

7378
07:02:10,240 --> 07:02:11,440
and hopefully

7379
07:02:11,440 --> 07:02:13,520
maybe go back and help your high school

7380
07:02:13,520 --> 07:02:15,040
students and other students that have

7381
07:02:15,040 --> 07:02:17,040
the aptitude and interest in science

7382
07:02:17,040 --> 07:02:18,638
there's a lot of tools out there that

7383
07:02:18,638 --> 07:02:21,040
are free and this stuff will run in a

7384
07:02:21,040 --> 07:02:23,520
container running a vm run on a

7385
07:02:23,520 --> 07:02:25,680
raspberry pi beaglebone

7386
07:02:25,680 --> 07:02:28,718
uh this nasa core flight system that is

7387
07:02:28,718 --> 07:02:30,400
satellite software and it'll run on a

7388
07:02:30,400 --> 07:02:32,798
raspberry pi or your beaglebone or run

7389
07:02:32,798 --> 07:02:34,320
in a container

7390
07:02:34,320 --> 07:02:36,558
you can download it for free the ball

7391
07:02:36,558 --> 07:02:37,760
aerospace

7392
07:02:37,760 --> 07:02:40,000
cosmos is actually a ground station

7393
07:02:40,000 --> 07:02:42,798
software it'll manage iot devices as

7394
07:02:42,798 --> 07:02:45,120
well but you can manage cfs with the

7395
07:02:45,120 --> 07:02:47,920
ball aerospace cosmos real nice gui

7396
07:02:47,920 --> 07:02:48,840
point and

7397
07:02:48,840 --> 07:02:51,440
click it's a nice tool that you might

7398
07:02:51,440 --> 07:02:54,958
want to play with and nasa 42 spa is a

7399
07:02:54,958 --> 07:02:56,878
space simulator and he'll do the whole

7400
07:02:56,878 --> 07:03:00,478
orbit uh simulation for you all in a

7401
07:03:00,478 --> 07:03:02,840
nice environment soon it's all free and

7402
07:03:02,840 --> 07:03:04,878
similar uh uh

7403
07:03:04,878 --> 07:03:07,760
that's nasa offers the nasa operational

7404
07:03:07,760 --> 07:03:10,240
simulator for small satellites nos three

7405
07:03:10,240 --> 07:03:12,160
that's also available out on github for

7406
07:03:12,160 --> 07:03:14,638
free if you that's another satellite you

7407
07:03:14,638 --> 07:03:16,000
can play with

7408
07:03:16,000 --> 07:03:18,080
and then uh if you want to go and

7409
07:03:18,080 --> 07:03:20,160
look at uh doing satellite tracking

7410
07:03:20,160 --> 07:03:21,920
there's art the artemis project and

7411
07:03:21,920 --> 07:03:23,280
satnags

7412
07:03:23,280 --> 07:03:25,200
they're pretty interesting but uh the

7413
07:03:25,200 --> 07:03:27,520
openstack kit's pretty popular

7414
07:03:27,520 --> 07:03:28,718
and i'd highly recommend if you're

7415
07:03:28,718 --> 07:03:30,240
interested in learning more about

7416
07:03:30,240 --> 07:03:32,320
satellites and playing with it getting

7417
07:03:32,320 --> 07:03:34,798
familiar with protocols etc go look at

7418
07:03:34,798 --> 07:03:38,478
uh the open side kit that nasa

7419
07:03:38,478 --> 07:03:40,240
has released it's got to work nasa put

7420
07:03:40,240 --> 07:03:41,280
it out there

7421
07:03:41,280 --> 07:03:44,478
they know a little bit about space

7422
07:03:45,120 --> 07:03:46,558
but

7423
07:03:46,558 --> 07:03:47,360
but

7424
07:03:47,360 --> 07:03:48,718
that's what i had to present to you guys

7425
07:03:48,718 --> 07:03:49,920
today uh

7426
07:03:49,920 --> 07:03:51,680
i really really appreciate the security

7427
07:03:51,680 --> 07:03:53,280
fest team uh giving me the opportunity

7428
07:03:53,280 --> 07:03:55,920
to come to sweden and hang out with

7429
07:03:55,920 --> 07:03:57,120
everyone it's been really nice it's a

7430
07:03:57,120 --> 07:04:00,160
beautiful country it's really nice uh

7431
07:04:00,160 --> 07:04:02,320
it's before i step off stage any

7432
07:04:02,320 --> 07:04:04,798
questions

7433
07:04:05,360 --> 07:04:07,878
come on guys don't be shy it's about

7434
07:04:07,878 --> 07:04:11,958
space yeah

7435
07:04:25,520 --> 07:04:26,638
are you talking about satellite the

7436
07:04:26,638 --> 07:04:29,840
satellite did you yeah well the

7437
07:04:29,840 --> 07:04:32,638
satellite he's asking is uh

7438
07:04:32,638 --> 07:04:34,160
is the threat changing we're like with

7439
07:04:34,160 --> 07:04:35,920
starlink with all the large

7440
07:04:35,920 --> 07:04:38,000
constellations that are going up with

7441
07:04:38,000 --> 07:04:39,280
satellites there's a lot of large

7442
07:04:39,280 --> 07:04:40,798
constellations going on not just

7443
07:04:40,798 --> 07:04:42,320
startling

7444
07:04:42,320 --> 07:04:44,160
i'm

7445
07:04:44,160 --> 07:04:46,400
you know space is really huge so if a

7446
07:04:46,400 --> 07:04:49,600
satellite got if satellite got attacked

7447
07:04:49,600 --> 07:04:51,200
if someone was to take control of a

7448
07:04:51,200 --> 07:04:55,040
satellite that had propulsion capability

7449
07:04:55,040 --> 07:04:57,520
uh theoretically

7450
07:04:57,520 --> 07:04:59,360
you could drive that satellite that's

7451
07:04:59,360 --> 07:05:00,958
been taking control of and try to go and

7452
07:05:00,958 --> 07:05:03,200
drive it into debris or to another

7453
07:05:03,200 --> 07:05:05,520
satellite but the the vacuum of space is

7454
07:05:05,520 --> 07:05:06,718
really huge so it's going to have to

7455
07:05:06,718 --> 07:05:08,320
have the fuel and be in the right orbit

7456
07:05:08,320 --> 07:05:10,080
right place where it can get to that

7457
07:05:10,080 --> 07:05:12,400
point

7458
07:05:18,558 --> 07:05:20,958
well that's uh yeah

7459
07:05:20,958 --> 07:05:22,958
so from the cyber side it's all

7460
07:05:22,958 --> 07:05:24,718
theoretical right now there's nothing

7461
07:05:24,718 --> 07:05:27,680
that's been been shown to happen

7462
07:05:27,680 --> 07:05:29,120
that i've been able to read i just read

7463
07:05:29,120 --> 07:05:31,600
a couple papers where a few people

7464
07:05:31,600 --> 07:05:34,000
brought up the idea

7465
07:05:34,000 --> 07:05:35,120
but

7466
07:05:35,120 --> 07:05:37,040
i'm sure i'm sure something could happen

7467
07:05:37,040 --> 07:05:38,718
in the future maybe especially if

7468
07:05:38,718 --> 07:05:40,958
they're trusted maybe if there's a

7469
07:05:40,958 --> 07:05:42,320
satellite you know there's a couple

7470
07:05:42,320 --> 07:05:43,440
satellites that are talking to each

7471
07:05:43,440 --> 07:05:44,478
other they're part of the same

7472
07:05:44,478 --> 07:05:46,320
constellation they have that trust

7473
07:05:46,320 --> 07:05:48,638
relationship where they're talking uh

7474
07:05:48,638 --> 07:05:50,638
over uh

7475
07:05:50,638 --> 07:05:52,958
you know optical uh free space laser

7476
07:05:52,958 --> 07:05:54,400
communication which is being popped

7477
07:05:54,400 --> 07:05:57,040
about a lot right now or rf comms maybe

7478
07:05:57,040 --> 07:05:58,320
through that truss relationship a

7479
07:05:58,320 --> 07:06:00,240
satellite could be used to export

7480
07:06:00,240 --> 07:06:01,840
another satellite

7481
07:06:01,840 --> 07:06:02,798
but

7482
07:06:02,798 --> 07:06:04,000
but that's right now it's all

7483
07:06:04,000 --> 07:06:05,920
theoretical but certainly something that

7484
07:06:05,920 --> 07:06:08,160
could possibly happen if someone has the

7485
07:06:08,160 --> 07:06:10,240
knowledge of uh that constellation and

7486
07:06:10,240 --> 07:06:11,120
how it's

7487
07:06:11,120 --> 07:06:12,798
orchestrated

7488
07:06:12,798 --> 07:06:14,878
it's probably it's like says theoretical

7489
07:06:14,878 --> 07:06:16,240
but it's probably possible you know how

7490
07:06:16,240 --> 07:06:17,760
much of what we deal with every day was

7491
07:06:17,760 --> 07:06:19,520
theoretical

7492
07:06:19,520 --> 07:06:23,280
you know months ago now it's happening

7493
07:06:23,520 --> 07:06:26,558
all right anyone else

7494
07:06:27,120 --> 07:06:28,400
don't be shy

7495
07:06:28,400 --> 07:06:29,920
he's putting the cyber back in

7496
07:06:29,920 --> 07:06:31,440
cyberspace

7497
07:06:31,440 --> 07:06:33,600
come on guys

7498
07:06:33,600 --> 07:06:34,558

yay

7520
07:27:52,160 --> 07:27:54,160
it's gonna be fun i'm not gonna do the

7521
07:27:54,160 --> 07:27:56,558
thing that all the other cool people did

7522
07:27:56,558 --> 07:27:59,280
like space hacking and

7523
07:27:59,280 --> 07:28:00,878
no not

7524
07:28:00,878 --> 07:28:02,958
but i'm gonna show you some neat stuff

7525
07:28:02,958 --> 07:28:04,638
that's probably gonna

7526
07:28:04,638 --> 07:28:06,478
you know change the way you think about

7527
07:28:06,478 --> 07:28:09,040
your research because all of you

7528
07:28:09,040 --> 07:28:11,920
do cool stuff and that stuff

7529
07:28:11,920 --> 07:28:14,718
needs to be viewed by people and

7530
07:28:14,718 --> 07:28:17,760
way to do that is simply to

7531
07:28:17,760 --> 07:28:20,638
make sure that it gets available and

7532
07:28:20,638 --> 07:28:22,320
find that's why we're gonna have it

7533
07:28:22,320 --> 07:28:24,878
today's topic is how to write a banger

7534
07:28:24,878 --> 07:28:26,320
blog post and

7535
07:28:26,320 --> 07:28:27,760
the importance of having a personal

7536
07:28:27,760 --> 07:28:28,958
brand so

7537
07:28:28,958 --> 07:28:32,000
this is my this is not my this is my

7538
07:28:32,000 --> 07:28:36,718
name hi uh this is my friend stephan

7539
07:28:36,718 --> 07:28:39,360
he's uh he's from germany and he has

7540
07:28:39,360 --> 07:28:42,000
this really cool website

7541
07:28:42,000 --> 07:28:43,600
where he puts

7542
07:28:43,600 --> 07:28:46,718
articles around hacking and stuff that's

7543
07:28:46,718 --> 07:28:48,798
what he does and

7544
07:28:48,798 --> 07:28:52,080
he has somewhere around 70 to

7545
07:28:52,080 --> 07:28:54,240
sometimes 100 000 views every month on

7546
07:28:54,240 --> 07:28:56,638
the content he creates which is pretty

7547
07:28:56,638 --> 07:28:59,760
sweet and that's not a fluke because

7548
07:28:59,760 --> 07:29:03,600
he understands the value of keyword

7549
07:29:03,600 --> 07:29:06,558
research so as we can see here cosec

7550
07:29:06,558 --> 07:29:09,680
which is his domain he's ranking on

7551
07:29:09,680 --> 07:29:12,398
these positions like one two two one two

7552
07:29:12,398 --> 07:29:14,878
two one on these

7553
07:29:14,878 --> 07:29:17,440
these different topics here on google

7554
07:29:17,440 --> 07:29:19,600
search and that is

7555
07:29:19,600 --> 07:29:23,440
everywhere internationally so he gets

7556
07:29:23,440 --> 07:29:25,920
on hack book books on hacking hacking

7557
07:29:25,920 --> 07:29:27,840
books best hacking books and then

7558
07:29:27,840 --> 07:29:29,040
eventually

7559
07:29:29,040 --> 07:29:31,280
hack wordpress website not that many

7560
07:29:31,280 --> 07:29:33,360
people looks at that but hey

7561
07:29:33,360 --> 07:29:34,798
people are still interested in doing

7562
07:29:34,798 --> 07:29:37,360
that so he drives that traffic and you

7563
07:29:37,360 --> 07:29:40,080
can see here these are the estimates of

7564
07:29:40,080 --> 07:29:42,798
amount of searches every month

7565
07:29:42,798 --> 07:29:44,320
that's being made

7566
07:29:44,320 --> 07:29:45,360
11

7567
07:29:45,360 --> 07:29:48,558
300 on hack books and he gets an average

7568
07:29:48,558 --> 07:29:51,680
around 4 000 on that

7569
07:29:51,680 --> 07:29:53,520
pretty sweet right

7570
07:29:53,520 --> 07:29:55,680
because the thing is that all these

7571
07:29:55,680 --> 07:29:58,000
different keywords that he ranks on he's

7572
07:29:58,000 --> 07:30:01,120
driving into this blog post that he runs

7573
07:30:01,120 --> 07:30:02,320
ads on

7574
07:30:02,320 --> 07:30:04,558
so he can keep back and relax and have a

7575
07:30:04,558 --> 07:30:06,718
really good time while people purchase

7576
07:30:06,718 --> 07:30:08,638
stuff online on the internet and he's

7577
07:30:08,638 --> 07:30:11,280
getting a good side hustle income not

7578
07:30:11,280 --> 07:30:13,600
bad for writing a blog right

7579
07:30:13,600 --> 07:30:16,638
in the meantime i'm over here 100 000

7580
07:30:16,638 --> 07:30:18,478
subscribers on my youtube a couple of

7581
07:30:18,478 --> 07:30:20,080
looks and

7582
07:30:20,080 --> 07:30:22,558
i earn about less what

7583
07:30:22,558 --> 07:30:25,760
you guys charge an hour

7584
07:30:25,760 --> 07:30:28,240
so i'm a bit jealous there

7585
07:30:28,240 --> 07:30:30,478
and the reason why this is working out

7586
07:30:30,478 --> 07:30:33,760
for stefan is that he understands

7587
07:30:33,760 --> 07:30:38,320
seo which is search engine optimization

7588
07:30:38,320 --> 07:30:41,440
but he also understands search engine

7589
07:30:41,440 --> 07:30:44,798
result pages which is this serp thing

7590
07:30:44,798 --> 07:30:47,120
this is marketing baba

7591
07:30:47,120 --> 07:30:50,160
but you'll get used to it after a while

7592
07:30:50,160 --> 07:30:51,360
and

7593
07:30:51,360 --> 07:30:53,600
what is when we're talking about ranking

7594
07:30:53,600 --> 07:30:55,280
serp it's this

7595
07:30:55,280 --> 07:30:56,320
getting

7596
07:30:56,320 --> 07:30:59,600
the number one spot on your keyword that

7597
07:30:59,600 --> 07:31:01,200
you're searching for

7598
07:31:01,200 --> 07:31:03,040
on a particular

7599
07:31:03,040 --> 07:31:05,280
topic and then adapting accordingly to

7600
07:31:05,280 --> 07:31:07,920
rank of number one there's

7601
07:31:07,920 --> 07:31:10,558
well there's over 100 factors

7602
07:31:10,558 --> 07:31:13,600
to be really fair google don't really

7603
07:31:13,600 --> 07:31:15,840
talk about it they don't tell anyone and

7604
07:31:15,840 --> 07:31:18,000
most people just guess around you can

7605
07:31:18,000 --> 07:31:20,240
guess around pretty well by earning

7606
07:31:20,240 --> 07:31:24,718
about a 52 000 year to be a seo

7607
07:31:24,718 --> 07:31:25,920
specialist

7608
07:31:25,920 --> 07:31:28,320
this is an average salary

7609
07:31:28,320 --> 07:31:31,280
i'm not an expert this is not me

7610
07:31:31,280 --> 07:31:33,520

7611
07:31:33,520 --> 07:31:34,558

that's going to help you to

7613
07:31:37,600 --> 07:31:40,000
you know get your content seen if you

7614
07:31:40,000 --> 07:31:42,558
spend a lot of time doing research

7615
07:31:42,558 --> 07:31:44,080
it's way more fun if people read it

7616
07:31:44,080 --> 07:31:45,280
right so we're going to talk about

7617
07:31:45,280 --> 07:31:46,638
keyword research we're going to talk

7618

about domains and their authority we're

7619
07:31:48,878 --> 07:31:51,840
going to talk about titling and metadata

7620
07:31:51,840 --> 07:31:54,080
serp clickbaits

7621
07:31:54,080 --> 07:31:57,360
filenames redux and other stuff in short

7622
07:31:57,360 --> 07:31:59,040
we're going to talk about how you can

7623
07:31:59,040 --> 07:32:01,280
get things to rank on the first page on

7624
07:32:01,280 --> 07:32:03,440
google awesome

7625
07:32:03,440 --> 07:32:06,080
bear in mind with me though

7626
07:32:06,080 --> 07:32:08,798
content is king you need to provide

7627
07:32:08,798 --> 07:32:10,798
value when you do these things if you

7628
07:32:10,798 --> 07:32:13,280
don't we're going to penalize you

7629
07:32:13,280 --> 07:32:14,478
because you're

7630
07:32:14,478 --> 07:32:16,958
you're farming backlinks or you you

7631
07:32:16,958 --> 07:32:20,080
stuffing keywords in your page and they

7632
07:32:20,080 --> 07:32:22,798
don't like that so don't don't go black

7633
07:32:22,798 --> 07:32:25,600
hat seo on me try to do it the ordinary

7634
07:32:25,600 --> 07:32:27,440
way and google is going to love you for

7635
07:32:27,440 --> 07:32:29,840
that

7636
07:32:30,080 --> 07:32:32,240
here's another thing too

7637
07:32:32,240 --> 07:32:34,080
most of us in tech

7638
07:32:34,080 --> 07:32:35,200
not really

7639
07:32:35,200 --> 07:32:36,558
as common in sweden as it is

7640
07:32:36,558 --> 07:32:38,398
internationally spent about three to

7641
07:32:38,398 --> 07:32:41,280
five years at a company that's a long

7642
07:32:41,280 --> 07:32:43,360
that's the time we spend between we

7643
07:32:43,360 --> 07:32:44,878
changing employers

7644
07:32:44,878 --> 07:32:46,798
and during that time we want to do the

7645
07:32:46,798 --> 07:32:48,160
things that we do

7646
07:32:48,160 --> 07:32:50,478
we want to do cool research

7647
07:32:50,478 --> 07:32:53,360
that's amazing and mind-breaking and

7648
07:32:53,360 --> 07:32:56,320
everything's all awesome

7649
07:32:56,320 --> 07:32:59,360
and leave all that marketing

7650
07:32:59,360 --> 07:33:00,080
to

7651
07:33:00,080 --> 07:33:03,680
the the marketing people that have

7652
07:33:03,680 --> 07:33:06,240

7654
07:33:09,600 --> 07:33:10,958
things that

7655
07:33:10,958 --> 07:33:12,878
they think is super super important

7656
07:33:12,878 --> 07:33:15,360
while you're there and doing your cool

7657
07:33:15,360 --> 07:33:16,638
research

7658
07:33:16,638 --> 07:33:18,638
so

7659
07:33:18,638 --> 07:33:19,760
you're doing your stuff and you're

7660
07:33:19,760 --> 07:33:22,320

7663
07:33:27,280 --> 07:33:28,558
so

7664
07:33:28,558 --> 07:33:31,280
so when they have this brainstorming

7665
07:33:31,280 --> 07:33:32,638
meeting where they're going to create

7666
07:33:32,638 --> 07:33:34,718
their content calendar

7667
07:33:34,718 --> 07:33:36,958
together they're like okay let's talk

7668
07:33:36,958 --> 07:33:39,200
about the research that this guide made

7669
07:33:39,200 --> 07:33:41,920
 now let's do talk about sales

7670
07:33:41,920 --> 07:33:43,920
because that's what marketing are here

7671
07:33:43,920 --> 07:33:46,558
for their job is to drive

7672
07:33:46,558 --> 07:33:49,360
money you're meant to do something else

7673
07:33:49,360 --> 07:33:50,718
so um

7674
07:33:50,718 --> 07:33:52,478
when you quit that job

7675
07:33:52,478 --> 07:33:54,478
and say i'm done with this now i'm gonna

7676
07:33:54,478 --> 07:33:57,360
go somewhere else and have fun

7677
07:33:57,360 --> 07:33:58,958
the thing is that you're gonna have a

7678
07:33:58,958 --> 07:34:01,920
new squad of marketing people to rely on

7679
07:34:01,920 --> 07:34:04,160
that's gonna do oh we're gonna do cool

7680
07:34:04,160 --> 07:34:07,200
research no we're gonna do sales so

7681
07:34:07,200 --> 07:34:08,798
you need to start the whole process over

7682
07:34:08,798 --> 07:34:11,120
again every three to five years which is

7683
07:34:11,120 --> 07:34:14,478
not that fun and that is why you need a

7684
07:34:14,478 --> 07:34:16,398
personal brand

7685
07:34:16,398 --> 07:34:19,280
okay i see a lot of introverts in here

7686
07:34:19,280 --> 07:34:21,520
don't freak out you don't need to be

7687
07:34:21,520 --> 07:34:22,878
like me

7688
07:34:22,878 --> 07:34:25,040
you can have a domain where you write

7689
07:34:25,040 --> 07:34:28,080
stuff and share information and cool

7690
07:34:28,080 --> 07:34:31,520
things right because who knows

7691
07:34:31,520 --> 07:34:32,878
where you're going to be in the next

7692
07:34:32,878 --> 07:34:34,878
three to five years and wouldn't it be

7693
07:34:34,878 --> 07:34:37,520
cool then just fall back

7694
07:34:37,520 --> 07:34:39,120
on the things that you created over

7695
07:34:39,120 --> 07:34:40,080
years

7696
07:34:40,080 --> 07:34:42,878
and even though you have your own domain

7697
07:34:42,878 --> 07:34:45,200
bear with me here company says

7698
07:34:45,200 --> 07:34:47,040
well you did this research actually on

7699
07:34:47,040 --> 07:34:50,160
your on your work time it belongs to us

7700
07:34:50,160 --> 07:34:51,360
you say yes

7701
07:34:51,360 --> 07:34:54,000
that is true is it okay if i publish it

7702
07:34:54,000 --> 07:34:56,718
on my own website as well

7703
07:34:56,718 --> 07:34:59,600

7704
07:34:59,600 --> 07:35:00,718

7705
07:35:00,718 --> 07:35:01,920
more

7706
07:35:01,920 --> 07:35:04,320
authority around your business company

7707
07:35:04,320 --> 07:35:07,120

7709
07:35:09,360 --> 07:35:11,120

everybody's happy so

7711
07:35:13,440 --> 07:35:15,920
owning your own brand is quite

7712
07:35:15,920 --> 07:35:16,878
interesting

7713
07:35:16,878 --> 07:35:18,798
let's do a case study for the fun of it

7714
07:35:18,798 --> 07:35:19,840
i mean

7715
07:35:19,840 --> 07:35:22,320
why not do practical things

7716
07:35:22,320 --> 07:35:25,760
this is my friend christopher

7717
07:35:25,760 --> 07:35:27,920
coog

7718
07:35:27,920 --> 07:35:29,760
coogs likes to

7719
07:35:29,760 --> 07:35:31,120
do barbecue

7720
07:35:31,120 --> 07:35:32,638
but he also likes to hack a lot of

7721
07:35:32,638 --> 07:35:33,440
things

7722
07:35:33,440 --> 07:35:35,280
i took that picture quite happy about

7723
07:35:35,280 --> 07:35:37,600
that by the way

7724
07:35:37,600 --> 07:35:39,920
he used to work at f-secure which is now

7725
07:35:39,920 --> 07:35:41,120
named something else that i don't know

7726
07:35:41,120 --> 07:35:42,240
what it is

7727
07:35:42,240 --> 07:35:46,080
and he has this domain called yarek

7728
07:35:46,080 --> 07:35:47,920
and he's quite fresh

7729
07:35:47,920 --> 07:35:49,680
you see here on way back here else he

7730
07:35:49,680 --> 07:35:51,760
hasn't been active since like the mid of

7731
07:35:51,760 --> 07:35:54,160
2021 probably where he decided that

7732
07:35:54,160 --> 07:35:56,398
maybe i should do something else with my

7733
07:35:56,398 --> 07:35:57,520
life

7734
07:35:57,520 --> 07:36:00,478
so he bought a domain

7735
07:36:00,478 --> 07:36:02,000
and

7736
07:36:02,000 --> 07:36:03,840
the question is why did he go for a

7737
07:36:03,840 --> 07:36:06,280
dot-com domain or a dot sc demand

7738
07:36:06,280 --> 07:36:08,958
jerky.se is a swedish domain

7739
07:36:08,958 --> 07:36:11,040
well he was smart there he didn't

7740
07:36:11,040 --> 07:36:12,558
didn't really know it at the time but he

7741
07:36:12,558 --> 07:36:15,680
was really smart because the whole idea

7742
07:36:15,680 --> 07:36:19,200
with getting a localized domain is that

7743
07:36:19,200 --> 07:36:21,840
we're in sweden now when we search on

7744
07:36:21,840 --> 07:36:22,878
things

7745
07:36:22,878 --> 07:36:25,120
a dot essay domain has got to get higher

7746
07:36:25,120 --> 07:36:28,958
ranking on the sites that we do

7747
07:36:28,958 --> 07:36:31,360
cook he's doing business in sweden

7748
07:36:31,360 --> 07:36:33,520
that's where he makes he has his

7749
07:36:33,520 --> 07:36:35,600
customers and that's where he's moving

7750
07:36:35,600 --> 07:36:37,920
around he don't really care about india

7751
07:36:37,920 --> 07:36:40,558
he doesn't care about the us well if

7752
07:36:40,558 --> 07:36:41,920
you're speaking at a conference maybe

7753
07:36:41,920 --> 07:36:42,718
but

7754
07:36:42,718 --> 07:36:44,398
not really

7755
07:36:44,398 --> 07:36:45,840
and when you're doing domains there's

7756
07:36:45,840 --> 07:36:47,120
different kinds of things you need to

7757
07:36:47,120 --> 07:36:49,120
think about should it be a subdomain

7758
07:36:49,120 --> 07:36:52,320
which is cool that kind of works but

7759
07:36:52,320 --> 07:36:54,958
you you need to deal with it seo based

7760
07:36:54,958 --> 07:36:57,360
as different sites just like a dot and

7761
07:36:57,360 --> 07:37:00,320
dot sc domain a dot d e domain needs to

7762
07:37:00,320 --> 07:37:02,638
be treated differently because if i

7763
07:37:02,638 --> 07:37:05,080
change let's say

7764
07:37:05,080 --> 07:37:09,360
blog.example.com to www

7765
07:37:09,360 --> 07:37:11,200
all those backlinks that i created

7766
07:37:11,200 --> 07:37:12,798
earlier

7767
07:37:12,798 --> 07:37:14,958
go down the drain so all the reputation

7768
07:37:14,958 --> 07:37:17,040
you built up over the years that's going

7769
07:37:17,040 --> 07:37:19,440
to be gone since you're greedy and wants

7770
07:37:19,440 --> 07:37:22,718
another domain so think about it first

7771
07:37:22,718 --> 07:37:23,520
right

7772
07:37:23,520 --> 07:37:25,600
so he has his domain you have that too

7773
07:37:25,600 --> 07:37:27,520
now right because all of you need

7774
07:37:27,520 --> 07:37:30,320
domains i'm not affiliated with godaddy

7775
07:37:30,320 --> 07:37:32,718
i probably should uh

7776
07:37:32,718 --> 07:37:34,558
but so you write your code and you put

7777
07:37:34,558 --> 07:37:36,398
it up there and you're all happy

7778
07:37:36,398 --> 07:37:39,200
the next step is to make google aware on

7779
07:37:39,200 --> 07:37:40,638
the things that you actually do this is

7780
07:37:40,638 --> 07:37:43,520
called indexing there's a great tool

7781
07:37:43,520 --> 07:37:46,638
called google search console which is

7782
07:37:46,638 --> 07:37:49,040
mandatory for you to use if you use a

7783
07:37:49,040 --> 07:37:51,120
website because this is where you

7784
07:37:51,120 --> 07:37:53,440
register your domain show your proof

7785
07:37:53,440 --> 07:37:55,200
that you own it

7786
07:37:55,200 --> 07:37:57,760
by using all these fancy authentication

7787
07:37:57,760 --> 07:37:59,360
things

7788
07:37:59,360 --> 07:38:02,000
that means google is going to pick it up

7789
07:38:02,000 --> 07:38:03,920
and know that you're doing stuff and

7790
07:38:03,920 --> 07:38:05,920
that's also where you can you can look

7791
07:38:05,920 --> 07:38:07,120
what kind of keywords people are

7792
07:38:07,120 --> 07:38:08,558
searching for that hates your domain you

7793
07:38:08,558 --> 07:38:10,320
can also adapt to it it's really

7794
07:38:10,320 --> 07:38:11,600
important

7795
07:38:11,600 --> 07:38:13,600
and a way to identify if the domain you

7796
07:38:13,600 --> 07:38:16,240
have is actually indexed is doing like a

7797
07:38:16,240 --> 07:38:17,360
google door

7798
07:38:17,360 --> 07:38:19,280
site your site

7799
07:38:19,280 --> 07:38:21,120
things show up congratulations you've

7800
07:38:21,120 --> 07:38:22,878
been indexed

7801
07:38:22,878 --> 07:38:25,760
things doesn't show up sucks being you

7802
07:38:25,760 --> 07:38:29,199
and that can take up to six months

7803
07:38:29,440 --> 07:38:31,600
these ones are super boring nobody

7804
07:38:31,600 --> 07:38:33,600
really cares about robo.txt and

7805
07:38:33,600 --> 07:38:36,160
sitemap.xml it's just annoying stuff

7806
07:38:36,160 --> 07:38:38,240
unless you're a crawler and unless

7807
07:38:38,240 --> 07:38:39,440
you're googling bing and whatever

7808
07:38:39,440 --> 07:38:40,320
because

7809
07:38:40,320 --> 07:38:42,798
robot.txt kind of means please don't

7810
07:38:42,798 --> 07:38:44,398
look at these

7811
07:38:44,398 --> 07:38:48,478
while sitemap xml is wow you can index

7812
07:38:48,478 --> 07:38:50,160
all this stuff that comes here and i

7813
07:38:50,160 --> 07:38:51,840
actually updated things for you right

7814
07:38:51,840 --> 07:38:55,360
now google crawler so please upload that

7815
07:38:55,360 --> 07:38:57,920
information inside the index

7816
07:38:57,920 --> 07:39:01,280
this is crucial if you are releasing uh

7817
07:39:01,280 --> 07:39:03,120
blogs and whatever because you want to

7818
07:39:03,120 --> 07:39:04,478
rank up

7819
07:39:04,478 --> 07:39:06,558
kuganda the hand decided he didn't need

7820
07:39:06,558 --> 07:39:10,320
those so he got a 404 on both of those

7821
07:39:10,320 --> 07:39:12,718
which means that yeah

7822
07:39:12,718 --> 07:39:16,398
has a quite low domain authority it's

7823
07:39:16,398 --> 07:39:17,760
not really

7824
07:39:17,760 --> 07:39:19,520
trusted

7825
07:39:19,520 --> 07:39:20,440
like a

7826
07:39:20,440 --> 07:39:22,878
sitemap.xml would make a difference but

7827
07:39:22,878 --> 07:39:25,680
but that's the whole thing and if you if

7828
07:39:25,680 --> 07:39:27,760
he has no traffic and anything 14

7829
07:39:27,760 --> 07:39:29,680
referring ips but if we take century

7830
07:39:29,680 --> 07:39:31,840
instead they they're good at their stuff

7831
07:39:31,840 --> 07:39:34,240
they do they're currently ranking

7832
07:39:34,240 --> 07:39:35,840
somewhere around

7833
07:39:35,840 --> 07:39:38,080
alexa ranking 6 million or so that could

7834
07:39:38,080 --> 07:39:39,120
be better

7835
07:39:39,120 --> 07:39:41,600
but domain authority is good and they

7836
07:39:41,600 --> 07:39:43,120
get a lot of reference

7837
07:39:43,120 --> 07:39:45,680
this is what is defined as a trusted

7838
07:39:45,680 --> 07:39:48,240
domain 33 is cool

7839
07:39:48,240 --> 07:39:51,520
then we have my friend daniel measler

7840
07:39:51,520 --> 07:39:54,080
he has a podcast he has a newsletter he

7841
07:39:54,080 --> 07:39:56,798
do a lot of a lot of cool stuff he's

7842
07:39:56,798 --> 07:39:59,760
currently ranking on about 100 000 on

7843
07:39:59,760 --> 07:40:01,520
the alexa top

7844
07:40:01,520 --> 07:40:03,760
1 million websites that's a good number

7845
07:40:03,760 --> 07:40:06,240
he has a domain authority of 65

7846
07:40:06,240 --> 07:40:07,040
and

7847
07:40:07,040 --> 07:40:09,600
people are very actively helping him

7848
07:40:09,600 --> 07:40:12,638
push which means that if i get feature

7849
07:40:12,638 --> 07:40:15,360
on his domain and he links me

7850
07:40:15,360 --> 07:40:18,478
i get the authority of danny miesler

7851
07:40:18,478 --> 07:40:20,320
hitting my site

7852
07:40:20,320 --> 07:40:22,000
because that is what is defined as

7853
07:40:22,000 --> 07:40:24,558
domain authority that's why

7854
07:40:24,558 --> 07:40:27,520
you need a lot of backlinks and relevant

7855
07:40:27,520 --> 07:40:30,398
content so these crawlers and indians

7856
07:40:30,398 --> 07:40:32,160
and everyone else can do the things that

7857
07:40:32,160 --> 07:40:35,120
they say they don't do thank you

7858
07:40:35,120 --> 07:40:37,760
because everything according to google

7859
07:40:37,760 --> 07:40:40,240
there's no thing named domain authority

7860
07:40:40,240 --> 07:40:41,760
there's no thing named something else

7861
07:40:41,760 --> 07:40:43,680
because they want to rewrite the thing

7862
07:40:43,680 --> 07:40:45,600
all the time so of course they don't

7863
07:40:45,600 --> 07:40:47,360
want to do that but

7864
07:40:47,360 --> 07:40:48,878
like i mentioned it's really important

7865
07:40:48,878 --> 07:40:50,478
to remember that

7866
07:40:50,478 --> 07:40:53,760
if you link people uh or people link you

7867
07:40:53,760 --> 07:40:55,280
that's a good thing because that's going

7868
07:40:55,280 --> 07:40:56,558
to give you

7869
07:40:56,558 --> 07:40:58,638
a chance to

7870
07:40:58,638 --> 07:41:00,080
you know level up your game a bit and

7871
07:41:00,080 --> 07:41:01,760
gain more authority like stefan's

7872
07:41:01,760 --> 07:41:03,120
website for instance we talked about

7873
07:41:03,120 --> 07:41:05,680
that earlier 2000 websites is linking

7874
07:41:05,680 --> 07:41:09,120
him and he has about 16 000 backlinks

7875
07:41:09,120 --> 07:41:11,280
referring to his domain

7876
07:41:11,280 --> 07:41:12,718
it's good

7877
07:41:12,718 --> 07:41:14,558
the strength in his domain and that's

7878
07:41:14,558 --> 07:41:17,040
why he gets a higher ranking because if

7879
07:41:17,040 --> 07:41:19,760
you doing that well you're all good but

7880
07:41:19,760 --> 07:41:23,040
remember when i said that um

7881
07:41:23,040 --> 07:41:25,360
your website if it's called your

7882
07:41:25,360 --> 07:41:27,440
authority strengthening someone else

7883
07:41:27,440 --> 07:41:29,920
like i would say a 13 thing in this case

7884
07:41:29,920 --> 07:41:31,680
would be

7885
07:41:31,680 --> 07:41:33,440
this is a great hacker

7886
07:41:33,440 --> 07:41:34,718
i'm currently now authority

7887
07:41:34,718 --> 07:41:36,398
strengthening this

7888
07:41:36,398 --> 07:41:37,680
or i could say

7889
07:41:37,680 --> 07:41:40,080
um

7890
07:41:40,160 --> 07:41:42,718
jason is a great hacker there's well and

7891
07:41:42,718 --> 07:41:45,040
cook is a fraud that is something else

7892
07:41:45,040 --> 07:41:46,958
like you'll figure things out how it

7893
07:41:46,958 --> 07:41:49,280
works but for me personally

7894
07:41:49,280 --> 07:41:51,440
i don't care but google cares about the

7895
07:41:51,440 --> 07:41:53,440
authority and how that works and what

7896
07:41:53,440 --> 07:41:55,040
you can do if you want to be sneaky

7897
07:41:55,040 --> 07:41:57,040
because let's say your centaur and you

7898
07:41:57,040 --> 07:41:59,360
regret this great blog post and you

7899
07:41:59,360 --> 07:42:01,040
don't want to link to truesec because

7900
07:42:01,040 --> 07:42:02,718
that's a competition or

7901
07:42:02,718 --> 07:42:04,240
we want to see it

7902
07:42:04,240 --> 07:42:06,478
you can add this no follow here that

7903
07:42:06,478 --> 07:42:08,398
means domain authority stops here so

7904
07:42:08,398 --> 07:42:10,240
they can link our really really cool

7905
07:42:10,240 --> 07:42:12,878
blog post that we do and say no follow

7906
07:42:12,878 --> 07:42:14,958
no credits for you

7907
07:42:14,958 --> 07:42:16,718
which is great

7908
07:42:16,718 --> 07:42:19,280
if you don't want to dabble with your

7909
07:42:19,280 --> 07:42:20,478
competitor

7910
07:42:20,478 --> 07:42:23,878
on this other uh this website here a

7911
07:42:23,878 --> 07:42:26,080
ahrefs.com is where you can do that

7912
07:42:26,080 --> 07:42:27,360
lookup and

7913
07:42:27,360 --> 07:42:30,558
it's quite simple it'll just calculate

7914
07:42:30,558 --> 07:42:31,920
the amount of backlinks you had and

7915
07:42:31,920 --> 07:42:33,840
other stuff and look for that my site

7916
07:42:33,840 --> 07:42:35,440
for instance has

7917
07:42:35,440 --> 07:42:38,000
239 website link you might say 1200

7918
07:42:38,000 --> 07:42:40,478
backlinks a domain rating of

7919
07:42:40,478 --> 07:42:42,558
13. and

7920
07:42:42,558 --> 07:42:44,320
security fest on the other hand has uh

7921
07:42:44,320 --> 07:42:46,878
29 which is pretty decent

7922
07:42:46,878 --> 07:42:50,240
because you can see i have 23 do follow

7923
07:42:50,240 --> 07:42:51,760
which means people will strengthen my

7924
07:42:51,760 --> 07:42:55,040
authority and they have 63 so they have

7925
07:42:55,040 --> 07:42:57,520
a higher amount of people that same

7926
07:42:57,520 --> 07:42:59,680
that's trusted apparently you shouldn't

7927
07:42:59,680 --> 07:43:01,360
trust me so i have no problem with

7928
07:43:01,360 --> 07:43:03,040
people not trusting the things that i do

7929
07:43:03,040 --> 07:43:04,638
and strengthening my authority that's

7930
07:43:04,638 --> 07:43:05,440
cool

7931
07:43:05,440 --> 07:43:08,080
uh cnn on the other hand

7932
07:43:08,080 --> 07:43:09,760
very credible

7933
07:43:09,760 --> 07:43:13,200
93 to the domain rating that's sick but

7934
07:43:13,200 --> 07:43:16,240
they also have about 500 million

7935
07:43:16,240 --> 07:43:19,120
links pointing their domain and a lot of

7936
07:43:19,120 --> 07:43:21,520
those are pointing back cougar on the

7937
07:43:21,520 --> 07:43:24,840
other hand he has some work to do

7938
07:43:24,840 --> 07:43:28,638
uh he has not that much demand rating is

7939
07:43:28,638 --> 07:43:30,638
quite low but we dig into the things

7940
07:43:30,638 --> 07:43:32,000
that he's been working with because i

7941
07:43:32,000 --> 07:43:34,240
got mad respect for christopher and i

7942
07:43:34,240 --> 07:43:36,160
know he's super smart and done awesome

7943
07:43:36,160 --> 07:43:38,000
hacks he just hasn't built his own

7944
07:43:38,000 --> 07:43:39,920
personal brand

7945
07:43:39,920 --> 07:43:42,000
let's check out the top

7946
07:43:42,000 --> 07:43:44,160
referred

7947
07:43:44,160 --> 07:43:47,200
blog post that he has on his domain

7948
07:43:47,200 --> 07:43:48,798
and that is

7949
07:43:48,798 --> 07:43:51,600
newsletter post risk aware applications

7950
07:43:51,600 --> 07:43:54,478
nine external sites has linked into that

7951
07:43:54,478 --> 07:43:56,718
so let's dig into see what it is

7952
07:43:56,718 --> 07:43:59,760
riskyware applications that seems cool

7953
07:43:59,760 --> 07:44:02,398
um let's do some search engine analysis

7954
07:44:02,398 --> 07:44:05,120
of this and we can realize that he has

7955
07:44:05,120 --> 07:44:07,520
mentioned first off the title is risk

7956
07:44:07,520 --> 07:44:09,280
aware applications

7957
07:44:09,280 --> 07:44:10,160
you can see

7958
07:44:10,160 --> 07:44:12,000
also in the url there

7959
07:44:12,000 --> 07:44:14,398
so risk-aware application seems like the

7960
07:44:14,398 --> 07:44:16,398
thing he wants to push here that's the

7961
07:44:16,398 --> 07:44:18,240
word that's really interesting

7962
07:44:18,240 --> 07:44:21,360
but he only mentioned it twice

7963
07:44:21,360 --> 07:44:23,200
that's a little bit too low for google

7964
07:44:23,200 --> 07:44:25,760
to think that is super cool uh

7965
07:44:25,760 --> 07:44:28,718
he managed risk a bunch of times

7966
07:44:28,718 --> 07:44:32,160
and also application so

7967
07:44:32,160 --> 07:44:34,240
those are those he probably could rank

7968
07:44:34,240 --> 07:44:35,120
on

7969
07:44:35,120 --> 07:44:36,798
but risk

7970
07:44:36,798 --> 07:44:39,200
that's going to be very very hard

7971
07:44:39,200 --> 07:44:42,320
because risk is so so wide and most

7972
07:44:42,320 --> 07:44:43,760
people when they search they don't

7973
07:44:43,760 --> 07:44:46,638
search for risk cyber

7974
07:44:46,638 --> 07:44:48,638
they will search for something similar

7975
07:44:48,638 --> 07:44:50,398
like the one that he did so let's

7976
07:44:50,398 --> 07:44:52,798
identify that risk aware application

7977
07:44:52,798 --> 07:44:54,638
that seems like

7978
07:44:54,638 --> 07:44:56,878
okay we have something here right

7979
07:44:56,878 --> 07:45:00,160
but nobody is actually searching for it

7980
07:45:00,160 --> 07:45:02,558
so we spent a lot of time writing this

7981
07:45:02,558 --> 07:45:05,120
epic blog post banger

7982
07:45:05,120 --> 07:45:07,360
nobody's searching for it

7983
07:45:07,360 --> 07:45:08,160
so

7984
07:45:08,160 --> 07:45:10,320
i was like okay makes sense sweden right

7985
07:45:10,320 --> 07:45:13,200
because he's se and i was interested to

7986
07:45:13,200 --> 07:45:14,798
see like what's the search traffic in

7987
07:45:14,798 --> 07:45:16,000
sweden

7988
07:45:16,000 --> 07:45:18,638
but i went global on google trends and

7989
07:45:18,638 --> 07:45:20,878
it doesn't even exist

7990
07:45:20,878 --> 07:45:22,638
nobody cares about risk-aware

7991
07:45:22,638 --> 07:45:25,600
applications and that is why keyword

7992
07:45:25,600 --> 07:45:27,680
research when you're writing stuff is

7993
07:45:27,680 --> 07:45:30,558
crucial because otherwise your web your

7994
07:45:30,558 --> 07:45:32,398
blog post might just be very

7995
07:45:32,398 --> 07:45:34,398
very lonely on a part of the internet

7996
07:45:34,398 --> 07:45:37,520
that nobody will ever find

7997
07:45:37,520 --> 07:45:39,840
so let's imagine cook saw this talk

7998
07:45:39,840 --> 07:45:40,798
right

7999
07:45:40,798 --> 07:45:42,240
and now

8000
07:45:42,240 --> 07:45:44,718
he's ready to do another banger you know

8001
07:45:44,718 --> 07:45:46,398
this is going to be great

8002
07:45:46,398 --> 07:45:47,680
so

8003
07:45:47,680 --> 07:45:50,718
he ponders a bit and thinks that

8004
07:45:50,718 --> 07:45:53,920
security chaos engineering

8005
07:45:53,920 --> 07:45:55,200
tasty

8006
07:45:55,200 --> 07:45:56,958
i'm going to see what that does so he

8007
07:45:56,958 --> 07:45:58,398
types it in and he shakes it out and

8008
07:45:58,398 --> 07:45:59,520
says

8009
07:45:59,520 --> 07:46:02,478
chaos engineering seriously 11 000

8010
07:46:02,478 --> 07:46:04,638
searches every month month that seems

8011
07:46:04,638 --> 07:46:06,878
really cool and it's absolutely trending

8012
07:46:06,878 --> 07:46:10,958
as well this one is an up-and-comer

8013
07:46:10,958 --> 07:46:13,280
problem is chaos engineering in this

8014
07:46:13,280 --> 07:46:15,680
case is a more generic term and it's

8015
07:46:15,680 --> 07:46:17,840
quite hard for us to rank on because you

8016
07:46:17,840 --> 07:46:18,718
see

8017
07:46:18,718 --> 07:46:22,240
the keyword result possibility to rank

8018
07:46:22,240 --> 07:46:25,360
among the behemoths that mention this is

8019
07:46:25,360 --> 07:46:27,680
going to be quite hard 46 on this

8020
07:46:27,680 --> 07:46:31,120
scoring is a challenge for him with 1.5

8021
07:46:31,120 --> 07:46:34,320
so it's going to be tricky so

8022
07:46:34,320 --> 07:46:36,718
but cookie smart he knows how to funnel

8023
07:46:36,718 --> 07:46:39,120
and narrow down so he goes for

8024
07:46:39,120 --> 07:46:41,280
security chaos engineering which is

8025
07:46:41,280 --> 07:46:43,760
definitely within his niche right and

8026
07:46:43,760 --> 07:46:45,040
you can see here

8027
07:46:45,040 --> 07:46:48,478
about 240 search a month still good i

8028
07:46:48,478 --> 07:46:50,240
mean it's an up and comer there's a

8029
07:46:50,240 --> 07:46:52,320
chance for him to take a position here

8030
07:46:52,320 --> 07:46:54,718
and you can see that it's it's in the

8031
07:46:54,718 --> 07:46:57,040
green here that means 23 that's that's

8032
07:46:57,040 --> 07:46:58,638
simple that's you waking up in the

8033
07:46:58,638 --> 07:47:00,638
morning writing uh the things that i

8034
07:47:00,638 --> 07:47:02,478
told you and you're gonna rank on this

8035
07:47:02,478 --> 07:47:04,798
because but we are in a challenge

8036
07:47:04,798 --> 07:47:06,958
because you would see 23 here and this

8037
07:47:06,958 --> 07:47:09,360
went to something something has a domain

8038
07:47:09,360 --> 07:47:11,760
ranking of 16 and takes position 5 with

8039
07:47:11,760 --> 07:47:13,520
no links to it so

8040
07:47:13,520 --> 07:47:15,680
we're probably going to get that

8041
07:47:15,680 --> 07:47:17,280
so it's not really a big challenge for

8042
07:47:17,280 --> 07:47:18,958
us but

8043
07:47:18,958 --> 07:47:21,440
as everything in life

8044
07:47:21,440 --> 07:47:22,798
before

8045
07:47:22,798 --> 07:47:25,120
we go in an attack

8046
07:47:25,120 --> 07:47:27,840
we need to do recon and we need to know

8047
07:47:27,840 --> 07:47:29,280
our competition

8048
07:47:29,280 --> 07:47:32,080
that apparently wasn't the thing that

8049
07:47:32,080 --> 07:47:34,398
the current warlords

8050
07:47:34,398 --> 07:47:36,240
thought about so they didn't do any

8051
07:47:36,240 --> 07:47:39,360
recon but if you see this cool icon up

8052
07:47:39,360 --> 07:47:41,440
there the quotation quote that is

8053
07:47:41,440 --> 07:47:44,240
defined in google terms as

8054
07:47:44,240 --> 07:47:45,440
um

8055
07:47:45,440 --> 07:47:47,840
let's see here position zero it's not

8056
07:47:47,840 --> 07:47:50,080
official but that's the that's the thing

8057
07:47:50,080 --> 07:47:52,638
if if you get quoted on google you're

8058
07:47:52,638 --> 07:47:54,160
seeing all those like wikipedia gets

8059
07:47:54,160 --> 07:47:56,320
quoted that's like you

8060
07:47:56,320 --> 07:47:58,398
the second that happens you're like

8061
07:47:58,398 --> 07:48:00,160
authority

8062
07:48:00,160 --> 07:48:03,120
that person is definitely king of the

8063
07:48:03,120 --> 07:48:05,040
cancer i'm going to trust whatever that

8064
07:48:05,040 --> 07:48:06,398
says

8065
07:48:06,398 --> 07:48:07,280
so

8066
07:48:07,280 --> 07:48:09,200
let's dig into that because what are our

8067
07:48:09,200 --> 07:48:10,878
competition well it's o'reilly

8068
07:48:10,878 --> 07:48:12,878
apparently i mean they're strong where

8069
07:48:12,878 --> 07:48:14,478
they're 91

8070
07:48:14,478 --> 07:48:16,638
91 of domain authority it's going to be

8071
07:48:16,638 --> 07:48:18,558
tricky

8072
07:48:18,558 --> 07:48:21,600
and then open source the other article

8073
07:48:21,600 --> 07:48:23,280
but the rest of the competition is quite

8074
07:48:23,280 --> 07:48:24,878
easy so let's say that we want to aim

8075
07:48:24,878 --> 07:48:25,760
for

8076
07:48:25,760 --> 07:48:28,160
third i mean that's good enough for us

8077
07:48:28,160 --> 07:48:30,320
so let's dig in and see what we can do

8078
07:48:30,320 --> 07:48:31,360
with this

8079
07:48:31,360 --> 07:48:34,080
so this is the top ranking website on

8080
07:48:34,080 --> 07:48:35,760
this content

8081
07:48:35,760 --> 07:48:37,200
very cool

8082
07:48:37,200 --> 07:48:39,520
so what we do is that we'll take all the

8083
07:48:39,520 --> 07:48:41,840
blog post information copy that and

8084
07:48:41,840 --> 07:48:43,600
paste that into word counter for

8085
07:48:43,600 --> 07:48:45,680
instance because we want to know how

8086
07:48:45,680 --> 07:48:48,000
many words they wrote

8087
07:48:48,000 --> 07:48:51,240
they wrote 1600 words we gonna write

8088
07:48:51,240 --> 07:48:53,120
2500 words

8089
07:48:53,120 --> 07:48:54,320
because we're doubling down on the

8090
07:48:54,320 --> 07:48:56,718
content and we're providing more value

8091
07:48:56,718 --> 07:48:58,638
google is going to say

8092
07:48:58,638 --> 07:48:59,840
more value

8093
07:48:59,840 --> 07:49:01,760
definitely more interesting

8094
07:49:01,760 --> 07:49:04,478
which is cool and since we're smart and

8095
07:49:04,478 --> 07:49:06,160
professional we understand that google

8096
07:49:06,160 --> 07:49:07,840
is very picky about

8097
07:49:07,840 --> 07:49:09,920
spelling mistakes and is not having a

8098
07:49:09,920 --> 07:49:12,000
good conversation and flow i know your

8099
07:49:12,000 --> 07:49:14,398
researchers don't worry

8100
07:49:14,398 --> 07:49:16,958
but you need to be able to talk

8101
07:49:16,958 --> 07:49:20,558
or or soft language with people that

8102
07:49:20,558 --> 07:49:22,398
or at least the search engine i mean

8103
07:49:22,398 --> 07:49:24,320
that's how it works and

8104
07:49:24,320 --> 07:49:26,080
and the whole thing is that the key to

8105
07:49:26,080 --> 07:49:27,840
success here is not only to get a nice

8106
07:49:27,840 --> 07:49:29,680
spell checker it's also to provide a

8107
07:49:29,680 --> 07:49:31,440
solution to the problem of the people

8108
07:49:31,440 --> 07:49:32,798
that's looking for the things that you

8109
07:49:32,798 --> 07:49:33,920
provide

8110
07:49:33,920 --> 07:49:36,398
solve a problem right so let's see the

8111
07:49:36,398 --> 07:49:38,718
keyword density of our competition in

8112
07:49:38,718 --> 07:49:40,240
this case we can see that chaos

8113
07:49:40,240 --> 07:49:41,680
engineering is the one we're going for

8114
07:49:41,680 --> 07:49:44,160
right and it's been mentioned about

8115
07:49:44,160 --> 07:49:45,280
eight

8116
07:49:45,280 --> 07:49:48,240
is it nine times nine times right

8117
07:49:48,240 --> 07:49:50,958
how many times should we write it

8118
07:49:50,958 --> 07:49:53,200
any guesses

8119
07:49:53,200 --> 07:49:56,798
absolutely i love that but we can do 12

8120
07:49:56,798 --> 07:49:58,240
that's more than enough because we

8121
07:49:58,240 --> 07:50:00,638
provide more value in content related to

8122
07:50:00,638 --> 07:50:02,878
the original blog post but if you can

8123
07:50:02,878 --> 07:50:05,280
double down on it well that's cool and

8124
07:50:05,280 --> 07:50:07,600
you can also see here the the

8125
07:50:07,600 --> 07:50:09,680
the keyword that we want to rank on

8126
07:50:09,680 --> 07:50:12,958
security chaos engineering they use that

8127
07:50:12,958 --> 07:50:14,080
six times

8128
07:50:14,080 --> 07:50:16,558
so we can definitely use that a bunch of

8129
07:50:16,558 --> 07:50:18,878
times more right

8130
07:50:18,878 --> 07:50:20,398
and we dig into the website and we can

8131
07:50:20,398 --> 07:50:23,120
see that okay is there any other things

8132
07:50:23,120 --> 07:50:25,840
we can adapt when we want to do things

8133
07:50:25,840 --> 07:50:27,200
yes it is

8134
07:50:27,200 --> 07:50:29,920
open source.com references to article 18

8135
07:50:29,920 --> 07:50:32,558
slash one slash new paradigm in cyber

8136
07:50:32,558 --> 07:50:34,160
security

8137
07:50:34,160 --> 07:50:35,120
okay

8138
07:50:35,120 --> 07:50:36,798
that's cool that's nothing to do with

8139
07:50:36,798 --> 07:50:38,240
the title

8140
07:50:38,240 --> 07:50:40,558
but uh well it kind of has it's has

8141
07:50:40,558 --> 07:50:42,718
paradigm for cyber security how many

8142
07:50:42,718 --> 07:50:45,200
people do you think sit there and um i'm

8143
07:50:45,200 --> 07:50:47,760
going to google for paradigm in cyber

8144
07:50:47,760 --> 07:50:48,878
security

8145
07:50:48,878 --> 07:50:51,040
probably not or maybe this guy i don't

8146
07:50:51,040 --> 07:50:52,958
know so

8147
07:50:52,958 --> 07:50:55,680
another way for us to boost our

8148
07:50:55,680 --> 07:50:57,440
identification on just owning that

8149
07:50:57,440 --> 07:51:00,160
keyword would be for us to

8150
07:51:00,160 --> 07:51:01,760
look at the competition again in this

8151
07:51:01,760 --> 07:51:03,680
case we look at the images they had one

8152
07:51:03,680 --> 07:51:06,798
image on the website which is cool

8153
07:51:06,798 --> 07:51:08,320
that means that we will have at least

8154
07:51:08,320 --> 07:51:09,440
three

8155
07:51:09,440 --> 07:51:10,320
uh

8156
07:51:10,320 --> 07:51:13,680
and that image is um

8157
07:51:13,680 --> 07:51:15,200
is labeled like this

8158
07:51:15,200 --> 07:51:18,080
site's default files lead images file

8159
07:51:18,080 --> 07:51:21,440
underscore bankvault securesafe.png

8160
07:51:21,440 --> 07:51:23,520
i'm quite amazed that it doesn't say the

8161
07:51:23,520 --> 07:51:26,000
resolution

8162
07:51:26,000 --> 07:51:27,920
or a screenshot something something

8163
07:51:27,920 --> 07:51:30,798
dates which is more common

8164
07:51:30,798 --> 07:51:32,798
and what we would do since we're

8165
07:51:32,798 --> 07:51:34,798
since we're master people now and jet

8166
07:51:34,798 --> 07:51:37,440
jqb is the one we're doing we'll change

8167
07:51:37,440 --> 07:51:41,120
that so we'll have the path be security

8168
07:51:41,120 --> 07:51:43,280
dash chaos.engineering which turns into

8169
07:51:43,280 --> 07:51:44,478
space

8170
07:51:44,478 --> 07:51:46,718
not spacebase but space in google

8171
07:51:46,718 --> 07:51:49,120
indexing and we'll name the file

8172
07:51:49,120 --> 07:51:51,440
security chaos engineering is the new

8173
07:51:51,440 --> 07:51:54,320
black because if we only do the name

8174
07:51:54,320 --> 07:51:55,840
it's going to say okay and we see what

8175
07:51:55,840 --> 07:51:56,958
you're doing here

8176
07:51:56,958 --> 07:51:58,878
but we're not we're we're trying to

8177
07:51:58,878 --> 07:52:00,558
explain something else like and and then

8178
07:52:00,558 --> 07:52:01,760
we're going to name the files

8179
07:52:01,760 --> 07:52:03,600
differently it's going to be he's a new

8180
07:52:03,600 --> 07:52:05,040
black and he's

8181
07:52:05,040 --> 07:52:07,680
explained or super cool and all that and

8182
07:52:07,680 --> 07:52:09,440
we're going to top that thing up with

8183
07:52:09,440 --> 07:52:11,120
not having a boring safe that has

8184
07:52:11,120 --> 07:52:12,558
nothing to do with the thing we do and

8185
07:52:12,558 --> 07:52:14,638
instead add a really

8186
07:52:14,638 --> 07:52:17,680
click-baity image

8187
07:52:17,680 --> 07:52:19,440
apparently a real cool security

8188
07:52:19,440 --> 07:52:20,478
conference

8189
07:52:20,478 --> 07:52:22,398
uh and a guy

8190
07:52:22,398 --> 07:52:24,398
that says security chaos engineering

8191
07:52:24,398 --> 07:52:26,558
explained

8192
07:52:26,558 --> 07:52:29,600
and he said why why do you even put text

8193
07:52:29,600 --> 07:52:31,040
in there well

8194
07:52:31,040 --> 07:52:32,478
we all know that

8195
07:52:32,478 --> 07:52:34,798
google identifies things by using their

8196
07:52:34,798 --> 07:52:37,280
magical things and if there's text on it

8197
07:52:37,280 --> 07:52:40,080
that relates to the name of the file

8198
07:52:40,080 --> 07:52:41,760
there's a pretty big chance that these

8199
07:52:41,760 --> 07:52:44,240
guys really care about the subject

8200
07:52:44,240 --> 07:52:46,398
and to really boost it off you know kick

8201
07:52:46,398 --> 07:52:48,718
it off the raft what we do is that we're

8202
07:52:48,718 --> 07:52:50,000
going to add

8203
07:52:50,000 --> 07:52:52,638
alt text you're like all text people are

8204
07:52:52,638 --> 07:52:54,398
people blind to reading my blog post

8205
07:52:54,398 --> 07:52:56,240
probably a bad idea

8206
07:52:56,240 --> 07:52:58,240
but the thing is that that also adds

8207
07:52:58,240 --> 07:52:59,200
trust

8208
07:52:59,200 --> 07:53:02,080
and you're not supposed to stuff like

8209
07:53:02,080 --> 07:53:05,280
security chaos engineering comma devops

8210
07:53:05,280 --> 07:53:07,600
comma something else to gain more

8211
07:53:07,600 --> 07:53:08,958
keywords in there it needs to be

8212
07:53:08,958 --> 07:53:10,958
explanatory but it shouldn't be more

8213
07:53:10,958 --> 07:53:13,600
than 125 characters

8214
07:53:13,600 --> 07:53:16,080
not a novel but enough to google to

8215
07:53:16,080 --> 07:53:18,718
understand that you're being serious

8216
07:53:18,718 --> 07:53:20,398
and if we really want to boost the game

8217
07:53:20,398 --> 07:53:22,398
here and this is one of the last game

8218
07:53:22,398 --> 07:53:24,398
changers is that

8219
07:53:24,398 --> 07:53:25,840
google

8220
07:53:25,840 --> 07:53:27,760
is the world's largest largest surgeon

8221
07:53:27,760 --> 07:53:29,680
we can agree on that right

8222
07:53:29,680 --> 07:53:31,520
the second largest search engine is

8223
07:53:31,520 --> 07:53:32,878
youtube

8224
07:53:32,878 --> 07:53:35,600
and that means we got if we also publish

8225
07:53:35,600 --> 07:53:38,718
a video on youtube on this subject

8226
07:53:38,718 --> 07:53:41,440
we'll get the search on the optimization

8227
07:53:41,440 --> 07:53:42,478
from google

8228
07:53:42,478 --> 07:53:44,878
and also the trust from youtube which

8229
07:53:44,878 --> 07:53:47,120
means that when we search

8230
07:53:47,120 --> 07:53:50,160
there's a big chance that um that google

8231
07:53:50,160 --> 07:53:52,080
is going to present a youtube video in

8232
07:53:52,080 --> 07:53:54,320
the videos in the search for you which

8233
07:53:54,320 --> 07:53:56,638
is yours that's going to relate to the

8234
07:53:56,638 --> 07:53:58,240
things that you do

8235
07:53:58,240 --> 07:53:59,520
and

8236
07:53:59,520 --> 07:54:01,200
and that is very very important because

8237
07:54:01,200 --> 07:54:04,878
that way we can strengthen our own

8238
07:54:04,878 --> 07:54:07,520
authority and we'll also embed that on a

8239
07:54:07,520 --> 07:54:09,520
page so when the crawler keeps then it

8240
07:54:09,520 --> 07:54:11,120
seems like wow

8241
07:54:11,120 --> 07:54:13,000
three images dude

8242
07:54:13,000 --> 07:54:15,120
2500 words

8243
07:54:15,120 --> 07:54:17,280
providing value

8244
07:54:17,280 --> 07:54:19,520
and a video on the subject and a lot of

8245
07:54:19,520 --> 07:54:22,160
links to cool people some not follow

8246
07:54:22,160 --> 07:54:25,120
some yeah definitely going to be

8247
07:54:25,120 --> 07:54:26,798
interesting for us we're going to rank

8248
07:54:26,798 --> 07:54:28,718
that high

8249
07:54:28,718 --> 07:54:31,040
so they rank you high and this and now

8250
07:54:31,040 --> 07:54:33,280
the other factor comes in

8251
07:54:33,280 --> 07:54:36,638
search engine result page click bait

8252
07:54:36,638 --> 07:54:39,760
you're like uh clickbait i'm young the

8253
07:54:39,760 --> 07:54:42,398
law again i don't click bait

8254
07:54:42,398 --> 07:54:44,558
i'm gonna be very careful with that but

8255
07:54:44,558 --> 07:54:47,360
this is the thing if if you get a search

8256
07:54:47,360 --> 07:54:49,200
and you see some results what your eyes

8257
07:54:49,200 --> 07:54:50,718
gonna do is like

8258
07:54:50,718 --> 07:54:53,200
nah nah okay this i resonate with

8259
07:54:53,200 --> 07:54:54,878
you're good and if it's just

8260
07:54:54,878 --> 07:54:56,398
gibberish there

8261
07:54:56,398 --> 07:54:58,160
that you can't resonate with or that

8262
07:54:58,160 --> 07:55:00,320
doesn't tell you to do stuff you're most

8263
07:55:00,320 --> 07:55:01,920
likely not gonna click it you go for the

8264
07:55:01,920 --> 07:55:03,600
other one that's more

8265
07:55:03,600 --> 07:55:05,200
fitting to your needs

8266
07:55:05,200 --> 07:55:06,478
and

8267
07:55:06,478 --> 07:55:08,718
mangoes has this tool called search

8268
07:55:08,718 --> 07:55:10,000
engine

8269
07:55:10,000 --> 07:55:11,920
serp simulator where you can type in you

8270
07:55:11,920 --> 07:55:14,320
can test things around so let's say we

8271
07:55:14,320 --> 07:55:16,160
have

8272
07:55:16,160 --> 07:55:19,040
chaos security chaos engineering i did

8273
07:55:19,040 --> 07:55:20,718
this

8274
07:55:20,718 --> 07:55:23,840
then we can say what is security chaos

8275
07:55:23,840 --> 07:55:25,440
engineering

8276
07:55:25,440 --> 07:55:27,200
are you shifting left

8277
07:55:27,200 --> 07:55:29,920
devops all the things here are 10 great

8278
07:55:29,920 --> 07:55:32,478
insights that would help you become

8279
07:55:32,478 --> 07:55:35,440
security chaos engineering compliant

8280
07:55:35,440 --> 07:55:37,440
in no time

8281
07:55:37,440 --> 07:55:40,558
definitely see so clickbait

8282
07:55:40,558 --> 07:55:42,718
so and we've compared to that to the top

8283
07:55:42,718 --> 07:55:44,478
ranking one where it says

8284
07:55:44,478 --> 07:55:46,398
secured chaos engineering a new paradigm

8285
07:55:46,398 --> 07:55:48,478
in cyber security

8286
07:55:48,478 --> 07:55:50,798
too long doesn't fit in

8287
07:55:50,798 --> 07:55:52,558
look at it mobile it's going to cut half

8288
07:55:52,558 --> 07:55:54,000
of it out

8289
07:55:54,000 --> 07:55:55,760
the second one is explore how the

8290
07:55:55,760 --> 07:55:57,520
principles behind open source

8291
07:55:57,520 --> 07:56:00,160
collaborations transparency and rapid

8292
07:56:00,160 --> 07:56:02,000
prototyping are giving catalyst for

8293
07:56:02,000 --> 07:56:03,600
innovation

8294
07:56:03,600 --> 07:56:05,120
what

8295
07:56:05,120 --> 07:56:07,920
too techy for me i'm see so

8296
07:56:07,920 --> 07:56:10,638
i want to know about other things

8297
07:56:10,638 --> 07:56:12,478
and then we got social backlinks right

8298
07:56:12,478 --> 07:56:14,558
because you write this really cool blog

8299
07:56:14,558 --> 07:56:15,440
post

8300
07:56:15,440 --> 07:56:17,120
and uh yeah it could be in this case he

8301
07:56:17,120 --> 07:56:20,718
says like uh it will cook dms me he said

8302
07:56:20,718 --> 07:56:22,240
stuck

8303
07:56:22,240 --> 07:56:24,080
you mind if you could you know share the

8304
07:56:24,080 --> 07:56:27,200
new blog post that i wrote

8305
07:56:27,200 --> 07:56:30,160
 yeah of course i'll do that i got

8306
07:56:30,160 --> 07:56:33,440
about 100 3 000 people that engage with

8307
07:56:33,440 --> 07:56:37,760
my content on twitter i'm a be ashamed

8308
07:56:38,478 --> 07:56:40,080
and i've been and i've been doing this

8309
07:56:40,080 --> 07:56:42,240
continuously since 2018 i didn't have

8310
07:56:42,240 --> 07:56:44,798
anything then 2022

8311
07:56:44,798 --> 07:56:46,558
got a bunch of people looking at stuff

8312
07:56:46,558 --> 07:56:48,478
that i do so many people that i actually

8313
07:56:48,478 --> 07:56:50,798
got about 3.2 million people looking at

8314
07:56:50,798 --> 07:56:52,240
the things that i do

8315
07:56:52,240 --> 07:56:54,080
which is nice

8316
07:56:54,080 --> 07:56:57,040
hackfluencer

8317
07:56:57,680 --> 07:56:59,280
and that is very important for us to

8318
07:56:59,280 --> 07:57:01,360
understand that if i'm going to share

8319
07:57:01,360 --> 07:57:03,920
stuff i want it to look good so the

8320
07:57:03,920 --> 07:57:07,360
people that engage with my stuff say

8321
07:57:07,360 --> 07:57:09,600
i'm going to click that one

8322
07:57:09,600 --> 07:57:11,600
and if we do that right

8323
07:57:11,600 --> 07:57:13,840
like here you can see that the top one

8324
07:57:13,840 --> 07:57:15,760
is the twitter one you see no line

8325
07:57:15,760 --> 07:57:16,878
breaks here

8326
07:57:16,878 --> 07:57:19,280
and and then it's the linkedin one which

8327
07:57:19,280 --> 07:57:21,840
is more boring but you can probably add

8328
07:57:21,840 --> 07:57:23,280
some more stuff in there as well because

8329
07:57:23,280 --> 07:57:25,520
this is adaptable and that is what you

8330
07:57:25,520 --> 07:57:28,080
do inside the miata tags

8331
07:57:28,080 --> 07:57:32,000
me at attack meet the tags

8332
07:57:32,798 --> 07:57:35,520
so and this is very important i know

8333
07:57:35,520 --> 07:57:38,398
this is boring but you need to do this

8334
07:57:38,398 --> 07:57:40,958
and uh if you add all these things in

8335
07:57:40,958 --> 07:57:43,600
not are you only doubling down on what

8336
07:57:43,600 --> 07:57:45,120
is defined as

8337
07:57:45,120 --> 07:57:47,520
keywords and but you're also telling

8338
07:57:47,520 --> 07:57:48,958
google that

8339
07:57:48,958 --> 07:57:51,360
i'm serious about shares

8340
07:57:51,360 --> 07:57:53,120
please make sure that this is gonna get

8341
07:57:53,120 --> 07:57:55,360
shared to as many people as possible so

8342
07:57:55,360 --> 07:57:57,440
you write stuff in there you sneak in

8343
07:57:57,440 --> 07:57:59,840
things like

8344
07:57:59,840 --> 07:58:02,398
keywords security chaos engineering

8345
07:58:02,398 --> 07:58:05,440
chaos engineering and devseps

8346
07:58:05,440 --> 07:58:07,200
because you you want to do that and if

8347
07:58:07,200 --> 07:58:09,920
you're not feeling like coding and

8348
07:58:09,920 --> 07:58:11,760
here me at the text that i would help

8349
07:58:11,760 --> 07:58:13,360
you out you're going to say what kind of

8350
07:58:13,360 --> 07:58:15,040
resolution you need and you drag that

8351
07:58:15,040 --> 07:58:17,040
into a cool picture that looks great

8352
07:58:17,040 --> 07:58:18,638
definitely clickable you can adapt and

8353
07:58:18,638 --> 07:58:20,638
try things around and feel like it feels

8354
07:58:20,638 --> 07:58:22,638
good this is and you can send that to

8355
07:58:22,638 --> 07:58:23,920
your friends and say would you click

8356
07:58:23,920 --> 07:58:25,280
this

8357
07:58:25,280 --> 07:58:27,120
i mean jason would probably do that in a

8358
07:58:27,120 --> 07:58:29,840
phishing intent but that's another story

8359
07:58:29,840 --> 07:58:32,878
so if you optimize that and metadata

8360
07:58:32,878 --> 07:58:35,280
will spit out all these tags for you so

8361
07:58:35,280 --> 07:58:37,520
you can be human write in text that you

8362
07:58:37,520 --> 07:58:39,200
like you get a feel for it and you'll

8363
07:58:39,200 --> 07:58:41,120
get that coming out

8364
07:58:41,120 --> 07:58:43,520
when you publish that on your website

8365
07:58:43,520 --> 07:58:45,680
you make sure to change that

8366
07:58:45,680 --> 07:58:47,680
the meta tags iu stuff in there

8367
07:58:47,680 --> 07:58:49,120
obviously you need to look at the code

8368
07:58:49,120 --> 07:58:50,878
you don't run any bash script from the

8369
07:58:50,878 --> 07:58:53,280
internet you don't put any code that's

8370
07:58:53,280 --> 07:58:54,558
been created by someone else on your

8371
07:58:54,558 --> 07:58:55,920
website

8372
07:58:55,920 --> 07:58:57,520
so you'll go through those and you put

8373
07:58:57,520 --> 07:59:00,718
that out and you share it to

8374
07:59:00,718 --> 07:59:03,360
to a friend in a dm somewhere right or

8375
07:59:03,360 --> 07:59:06,080
share it what's going to happen is maybe

8376
07:59:06,080 --> 07:59:07,520
you do that on twitter like you you

8377
07:59:07,520 --> 07:59:10,478
twitter send it to someone

8378
07:59:10,478 --> 07:59:11,840
what twitter is going to do is that it's

8379
07:59:11,840 --> 07:59:13,840
going to get in there and it's going to

8380
07:59:13,840 --> 07:59:15,440
take the image and then it's going to

8381
07:59:15,440 --> 07:59:16,798
cache it

8382
07:59:16,798 --> 07:59:19,200
and you change your image on the blog

8383
07:59:19,200 --> 07:59:20,398
post

8384
07:59:20,398 --> 07:59:21,280
you

8385
07:59:21,280 --> 07:59:23,280
share it again because you realize that

8386
07:59:23,280 --> 07:59:25,280
a picture of you in

8387
07:59:25,280 --> 07:59:27,520
shorts in the summer season saying

8388
07:59:27,520 --> 07:59:31,040
security engineering didn't resonate

8389
07:59:31,040 --> 07:59:32,958
you share it again oh crap the old

8390
07:59:32,958 --> 07:59:36,000
picture is there damn it

8391
07:59:36,000 --> 07:59:37,840
then you can go in here this is cards

8392
07:59:37,840 --> 07:59:40,240
validator for for twitter where you'll

8393
07:59:40,240 --> 07:59:43,120
flush the cache so we'll do a new fetch

8394
07:59:43,120 --> 07:59:44,478
of your site

8395
07:59:44,478 --> 07:59:46,798
and update the image into their cache so

8396
07:59:46,798 --> 07:59:48,798
all your new sharing would be up to date

8397
07:59:48,798 --> 07:59:50,718
with things you do and that's the thing

8398
07:59:50,718 --> 07:59:53,120
it's gonna it's gonna change recursively

8399
07:59:53,120 --> 07:59:55,760
so if if i shared something last week

8400
07:59:55,760 --> 07:59:58,958
and you go on twitter and i've updated

8401
07:59:58,958 --> 08:00:00,398
my stuff there you're going to get the

8402
08:00:00,398 --> 08:00:01,760
new image

8403
08:00:01,760 --> 08:00:02,718
so

8404
08:00:02,718 --> 08:00:04,638
and then that way you can a and b test

8405
08:00:04,638 --> 08:00:05,760


8406
08:00:05,760 --> 08:00:06,558
right

8407
08:00:06,558 --> 08:00:09,840
really that didn't work out with csos i

8408
08:00:09,840 --> 08:00:11,360
need something that would trigger them

8409
08:00:11,360 --> 08:00:12,160
more

8410
08:00:12,160 --> 08:00:14,718
then you can find things that they will

8411
08:00:14,718 --> 08:00:16,798
be interacting with

8412
08:00:16,798 --> 08:00:19,040
i take no responsibility for the picture

8413
08:00:19,040 --> 08:00:21,200
chosen for this blog post by the truesec

8414
08:00:21,200 --> 08:00:22,958
marketing team

8415
08:00:22,958 --> 08:00:26,160
bearded guy looking sadly into

8416
08:00:26,160 --> 08:00:29,360
window reflection has nothing to do with

8417
08:00:29,360 --> 08:00:32,320
potent or domain

8418
08:00:32,320 --> 08:00:34,718
or being a domain administrator

8419
08:00:34,718 --> 08:00:36,558
probably sad

8420
08:00:36,558 --> 08:00:39,440
system engineer

8421
08:00:39,920 --> 08:00:41,440
here's another thing

8422
08:00:41,440 --> 08:00:43,680
we talked about social links right

8423
08:00:43,680 --> 08:00:45,440
so i'm sure i did a collaboration with

8424
08:00:45,440 --> 08:00:48,160
hack the box a while back and they are

8425
08:00:48,160 --> 08:00:50,478
very interested in tracking the things

8426
08:00:50,478 --> 08:00:52,558
that they do it's like stick we like you

8427
08:00:52,558 --> 08:00:56,160
can do stuff for us i'm like yeah

8428
08:00:56,160 --> 08:00:58,398
i can do stuff for you

8429
08:00:58,398 --> 08:00:59,520
pay me

8430
08:00:59,520 --> 08:01:01,760
and say okay cool but then our marketing

8431
08:01:01,760 --> 08:01:03,600
wants to know the tracking

8432
08:01:03,600 --> 08:01:05,360
we want to know that we invested in

8433
08:01:05,360 --> 08:01:07,200
something that gave results and they

8434
08:01:07,200 --> 08:01:08,638
gave me this link and that's something

8435
08:01:08,638 --> 08:01:10,558
that's in my contract so you provide me

8436
08:01:10,558 --> 08:01:13,760
a utm analytics link and i'll in and

8437
08:01:13,760 --> 08:01:16,638
i'll put that on whatever post i do

8438
08:01:16,638 --> 08:01:18,638
things that this is so long that

8439
08:01:18,638 --> 08:01:20,160
if you're gonna tweet it i have to tweet

8440
08:01:20,160 --> 08:01:22,398
it's gonna be gone anyway

8441
08:01:22,398 --> 08:01:23,120
and

8442
08:01:23,120 --> 08:01:25,760
and it kind of gives things away

8443
08:01:25,760 --> 08:01:27,760
in a way that i don't like

8444
08:01:27,760 --> 08:01:28,958
oh

8445
08:01:28,958 --> 08:01:31,200
medium social blah blah blah campaign

8446
08:01:31,200 --> 08:01:34,160
csctf most people writing weird stuff

8447
08:01:34,160 --> 08:01:36,240
here like campaign names marketing

8448
08:01:36,240 --> 08:01:37,680
people

8449
08:01:37,680 --> 08:01:39,360
sketchy i don't want to have that so

8450
08:01:39,360 --> 08:01:41,760
what i do is that i have my website

8451
08:01:41,760 --> 08:01:45,360
stockfree.com and i do a 302 redirect on

8452
08:01:45,360 --> 08:01:47,920
a link that i send to this

8453
08:01:47,920 --> 08:01:50,558
that way i'm sharing on my social media

8454
08:01:50,558 --> 08:01:52,798
hey you should join this really cool ctf

8455

check out stoke frederick.com

8456

ctf that's all i'm saying in my blog

8457
08:01:56,958 --> 08:01:58,878
post or my video because i'm not going

8458
08:01:58,878 --> 08:02:00,160
to say hi

8459
08:02:00,160 --> 08:02:01,360
check out this dub dub dub

08:02:03,680 --> 08:02:07,120
apocalypse 2020 question marks utm and

8462
08:02:07,120 --> 08:02:08,320
and so on

8463
08:02:08,320 --> 08:02:10,000
so you need something that's really fast

8464
08:02:10,000 --> 08:02:11,440
and understandable especially if you're

8465
08:02:11,440 --> 08:02:13,760
doing content or podcast or whatever

8466
08:02:13,760 --> 08:02:16,478
like a bunch of you probably have some

8467
08:02:16,478 --> 08:02:18,478
cool stuff that you want to share yet it

8468
08:02:18,478 --> 08:02:20,958
could be has one

8469
08:02:20,958 --> 08:02:22,958
and he would probably use do you know

8470
08:02:22,958 --> 08:02:24,398
something like

8471
08:02:24,398 --> 08:02:26,558
yeah

8472
08:02:27,200 --> 08:02:28,478
research

8473
08:02:28,478 --> 08:02:29,840
and then you can change whatever blog

8474
08:02:29,840 --> 08:02:31,840
post you want to have at cool research

8475
08:02:31,840 --> 08:02:34,320
because you can change that over time

8476
08:02:34,320 --> 08:02:36,558
and it's going to create backlinks for

8477
08:02:36,558 --> 08:02:39,280
you on the the big sites everywhere it's

8478
08:02:39,280 --> 08:02:41,440
going to be cool

8479
08:02:41,440 --> 08:02:44,398
so let's do another case study right uh

8480
08:02:44,398 --> 08:02:46,320
because i can't i can't just stand here

8481
08:02:46,320 --> 08:02:48,160
and talk about the things you should do

8482
08:02:48,160 --> 08:02:50,160
without you know doing things like

8483
08:02:50,160 --> 08:02:52,878
hacking and done doing the poc

8484
08:02:52,878 --> 08:02:56,320
so i figured we'd do some pocs

8485
08:02:56,320 --> 08:02:58,080
a while back

8486
08:02:58,080 --> 08:03:00,718
potent came out

8487
08:03:00,718 --> 08:03:02,558
and it has about

8488
08:03:02,558 --> 08:03:04,638
five thousand five hundred searches

8489
08:03:04,638 --> 08:03:06,000
every month people are interested in

8490
08:03:06,000 --> 08:03:08,398
this so we need to be in a situation

8491
08:03:08,398 --> 08:03:11,760
where we had trusec and in this case

8492
08:03:11,760 --> 08:03:14,000
ben pry bid mead

8493
08:03:14,000 --> 08:03:17,680
said that oh stuck i got this cool idea

8494
08:03:17,680 --> 08:03:20,718
i have this park and i want to share it

8495
08:03:20,718 --> 08:03:22,798
could we do that i'm like yep

8496
08:03:22,798 --> 08:03:24,638
but you need to write the blog post for

8497
08:03:24,638 --> 08:03:25,760
me

8498
08:03:25,760 --> 08:03:27,840
like damn it

8499
08:03:27,840 --> 08:03:29,040
and

8500
08:03:29,040 --> 08:03:30,478
we need to think about the things that

8501
08:03:30,478 --> 08:03:31,760
you want to talk about what do you want

8502
08:03:31,760 --> 08:03:33,120
to talk about

8503
08:03:33,120 --> 08:03:35,040
because that's the whole thing we need

8504
08:03:35,040 --> 08:03:38,000
to explain that in the title and needs

8505
08:03:38,000 --> 08:03:40,798
to be referenced in the url in this case

8506
08:03:40,798 --> 08:03:42,798
we decided that the keywords that we

8507
08:03:42,798 --> 08:03:44,878
want to target on search results would

8508
08:03:44,878 --> 08:03:45,680
be

8509
08:03:45,680 --> 08:03:48,160
the potem and the lm relay and active

8510
08:03:48,160 --> 08:03:49,920
directory

8511
08:03:49,920 --> 08:03:52,000
we put those all together in one right

8512
08:03:52,000 --> 08:03:54,798
so ntlm is being mentioned 19 times in

8513
08:03:54,798 --> 08:03:57,360
the blog post with pro times 16 and it's

8514
08:03:57,360 --> 08:03:59,520
all the potent was our main targeteers

8515
08:03:59,520 --> 08:04:01,520
we got that both in the

8516
08:04:01,520 --> 08:04:03,600
in the in the headers we got that in the

8517
08:04:03,600 --> 08:04:05,760
title description in the url you

8518
08:04:05,760 --> 08:04:08,478
remember that one right and we also you

8519
08:04:08,478 --> 08:04:10,558
know we threw ins on active directory

8520
08:04:10,558 --> 08:04:13,440
there for good measure i mean why not 10

8521
08:04:13,440 --> 08:04:14,398
times

8522
08:04:14,398 --> 08:04:16,718
and then we started to break it down

8523
08:04:16,718 --> 08:04:18,798
like having a good time here we were

8524
08:04:18,798 --> 08:04:20,798
explaining things step by step procedure

8525
08:04:20,798 --> 08:04:22,718
this is how you do it and this is very

8526
08:04:22,718 --> 08:04:24,080
important because

8527
08:04:24,080 --> 08:04:25,760
you can do all these things inevitably

8528
08:04:25,760 --> 08:04:28,160
and eventually you'll do

8529
08:04:28,160 --> 08:04:30,080
profit because your domain administrator

8530
08:04:30,080 --> 08:04:32,160
very easy to follow the next step with

8531
08:04:32,160 --> 08:04:34,240
this would be not to implement an image

8532
08:04:34,240 --> 08:04:36,718
but a code snippet so people can copy

8533
08:04:36,718 --> 08:04:38,718
paste stuff because you like i like

8534
08:04:38,718 --> 08:04:40,398
everyone else get really freaking

8535
08:04:40,398 --> 08:04:41,600
annoyed when we're doing we're going to

8536
08:04:41,600 --> 08:04:43,920
do hack stuff we have to type it we want

8537
08:04:43,920 --> 08:04:45,440
to copy paste

8538
08:04:45,440 --> 08:04:48,000
so and and google says

8539
08:04:48,000 --> 08:04:51,440
copy paste providing value

8540
08:04:51,440 --> 08:04:53,520
good so we do that too

8541
08:04:53,520 --> 08:04:55,440
links to external parties

8542
08:04:55,440 --> 08:04:58,398
so we send good traffic so we don't

8543
08:04:58,398 --> 08:05:00,958
uh and then we have a solution to the

8544
08:05:00,958 --> 08:05:05,199
problems in bullet points like this

8545
08:05:05,280 --> 08:05:06,398
bold

8546
08:05:06,398 --> 08:05:10,398
h3 ones very cool

8547
08:05:10,398 --> 08:05:12,398
images like this

8548
08:05:12,398 --> 08:05:14,160
very boring image

8549
08:05:14,160 --> 08:05:17,120
but the naming of the file

8550
08:05:17,120 --> 08:05:19,280
potentially relay

8551
08:05:19,280 --> 08:05:22,798
the ask base64 and then he had to push

8552
08:05:22,798 --> 08:05:24,478
the damn resolution in there but i'm

8553
08:05:24,478 --> 08:05:26,638
okay with that

8554
08:05:26,638 --> 08:05:27,840
and that is also important because

8555
08:05:27,840 --> 08:05:30,240
that's add to ranking then i told them

8556
08:05:30,240 --> 08:05:32,000
okay

8557
08:05:32,000 --> 08:05:34,478
you need to create a video for this

8558
08:05:34,478 --> 08:05:36,798
so how would i do that

8559
08:05:36,798 --> 08:05:39,280
well do it simple screenshot your image

8560
08:05:39,280 --> 08:05:41,280
your computer run that through and

8561
08:05:41,280 --> 08:05:42,878
you're happy shiny and when you're done

8562
08:05:42,878 --> 08:05:45,040
with that you'll take whatever

8563
08:05:45,040 --> 08:05:47,440
information you have and will do

8564
08:05:47,440 --> 08:05:50,160
voiceover so he made his wife do

8565
08:05:50,160 --> 08:05:52,478
voiceover for a one minute hack right

8566
08:05:52,478 --> 08:05:54,398
but he got six thousand views and we're

8567
08:05:54,398 --> 08:05:57,200
now referencing our own information back

8568
08:05:57,200 --> 08:05:59,520
this is great and that is why this one

8569
08:05:59,520 --> 08:06:01,840
is ranking number one on google on

8570
08:06:01,840 --> 08:06:03,200
time

8571
08:06:03,200 --> 08:06:05,360
doing the work delivering results

8572
08:06:05,360 --> 08:06:07,280
providing value

8573
08:06:07,280 --> 08:06:08,878
but we didn't stop there because

8574
08:06:08,878 --> 08:06:10,478
somebody's going to need to fix that

8575
08:06:10,478 --> 08:06:12,558
right sysadmin is like how to fix with

8576
08:06:12,558 --> 08:06:13,680
depot

8577
08:06:13,680 --> 08:06:16,000
so we decided to you know we're going to

8578
08:06:16,000 --> 08:06:19,600
rank at least on that too so we got both

8579
08:06:19,600 --> 08:06:21,680
in right that's cool

8580
08:06:21,680 --> 08:06:24,160
another case study i'm running over time

8581
08:06:24,160 --> 08:06:26,638
a bit can i get some more minutes

8582
08:06:26,638 --> 08:06:27,680
awesome

8583
08:06:27,680 --> 08:06:28,718
boom

8584
08:06:28,718 --> 08:06:30,638
not a case study so you don't take that

8585
08:06:30,638 --> 08:06:33,360
is do marketing stuff

8586
08:06:33,360 --> 08:06:35,840
this is my store thrive i sell country

8587
08:06:35,840 --> 08:06:38,398
fashion all organic sustainable it's all

8588
08:06:38,398 --> 08:06:39,200
cool

8589
08:06:39,200 --> 08:06:40,958
it's a small company

8590
08:06:40,958 --> 08:06:42,638
we don't have much money and a lot of

8591
08:06:42,638 --> 08:06:44,398
marketing budgets so we need to hack

8592
08:06:44,398 --> 08:06:46,558
things to you know get success

8593
08:06:46,558 --> 08:06:48,320
since we this is going to be in swedish

8594
08:06:48,320 --> 08:06:51,440
so bear with me on that

8595
08:06:53,520 --> 08:06:54,478
okay

8596
08:06:54,478 --> 08:06:55,280
so

8597
08:06:55,280 --> 08:06:56,958
one of the key things that we do is

8598
08:06:56,958 --> 08:06:59,440
ecuador is boom which is english

8599
08:06:59,440 --> 08:07:02,478
organic cotton right we're in sweden.sc

8600
08:07:02,478 --> 08:07:04,958
so we communicate in swedish because our

8601
08:07:04,958 --> 08:07:07,200
customers are swedish nothing weird

8602
08:07:07,200 --> 08:07:08,160
there

8603
08:07:08,160 --> 08:07:10,320
we do own.com as well

8604
08:07:10,320 --> 08:07:13,200
but since.com would require way more

8605
08:07:13,200 --> 08:07:15,440
work for us to drive traffic on an

8606
08:07:15,440 --> 08:07:16,798
international scale and have more

8607
08:07:16,798 --> 08:07:19,440
competition we decide to go with sc

8608
08:07:19,440 --> 08:07:20,558
because

8609
08:07:20,558 --> 08:07:22,240
we don't really ship internationally

8610
08:07:22,240 --> 08:07:24,558
anyway especially not at this stage you

8611
08:07:24,558 --> 08:07:26,478
know it's very expensive

8612
08:07:26,478 --> 08:07:29,200
but if you google uh if you google now

8613
08:07:29,200 --> 08:07:30,878
echologist

8614
08:07:30,878 --> 08:07:33,520
this is a trendy word so people mar in

8615
08:07:33,520 --> 08:07:35,840
marketing places they pay a lot of money

8616
08:07:35,840 --> 08:07:38,958
to get high ranking ads like this

8617
08:07:38,958 --> 08:07:41,840
hmm which is a pretty shitty

8618
08:07:41,840 --> 08:07:44,320
company

8619
08:07:44,320 --> 08:07:46,160
green washes themselves by talking about

8620
08:07:46,160 --> 08:07:48,000
organic cotton and paying a lot of money

8621
08:07:48,000 --> 08:07:50,240
to be ranking number one

8622
08:07:50,240 --> 08:07:52,080
well these are paid

8623
08:07:52,080 --> 08:07:54,160
so next time you google stuff all the

8624
08:07:54,160 --> 08:07:57,280
that says unowns or paid or or ads just

8625
08:07:57,280 --> 08:07:58,160
go

8626
08:07:58,160 --> 08:08:00,558
skip those unless you really trust the

8627
08:08:00,558 --> 08:08:02,398
origin because people are paying for

8628
08:08:02,398 --> 08:08:03,840
your traffic

8629
08:08:03,840 --> 08:08:06,080
so what i had to do is to i didn't have

8630
08:08:06,080 --> 08:08:07,680
any money to compete with those budgets

8631
08:08:07,680 --> 08:08:09,600
right these are pretty stiff budgets to

8632
08:08:09,600 --> 08:08:11,600
do organic cotton in sweden especially

8633
08:08:11,600 --> 08:08:12,878
if you've got h m and some other

8634
08:08:12,878 --> 08:08:16,000
companies to compete with so i did my

8635
08:08:16,000 --> 08:08:18,160
algorithm hacking right

8636
08:08:18,160 --> 08:08:21,680
big image eclogism

8637
08:08:22,798 --> 08:08:25,440
then time to do the words

8638
08:08:25,440 --> 08:08:26,320
so

8639
08:08:26,320 --> 08:08:28,000
we got a bunch of ecologists mumbling

8640
08:08:28,000 --> 08:08:30,398
there 19 times and we're explaining what

8641
08:08:30,398 --> 08:08:32,320
it is and we're providing the value

8642
08:08:32,320 --> 08:08:34,240
difference between what's the difference

8643
08:08:34,240 --> 08:08:35,920
between certified caution and organic

8644
08:08:35,920 --> 08:08:37,360
hot and what's the difference between

8645
08:08:37,360 --> 08:08:39,600
ecologist cotton and non-ecologist

8646
08:08:39,600 --> 08:08:41,840
cotton how does it work what kind of

8647
08:08:41,840 --> 08:08:44,160
certificates are involved in this

8648
08:08:44,160 --> 08:08:46,558
all that goes into

8649
08:08:46,558 --> 08:08:49,680
providing value to whoever searches for

8650
08:08:49,680 --> 08:08:51,360
eclipse

8651
08:08:51,360 --> 08:08:53,760
and i even tweaked it so you can see

8652
08:08:53,760 --> 08:08:56,798
that tiny image there that says

8653
08:08:56,798 --> 08:09:00,000
all the way echologies

8654
08:09:00,000 --> 08:09:02,878
and then eclogues boom soil association

8655
08:09:02,878 --> 08:09:04,840
instead of just given the name of soil

8656
08:09:04,840 --> 08:09:07,280
association i'm putting my keywords in

8657
08:09:07,280 --> 08:09:09,360
there i'm kind of stuffing but not that

8658
08:09:09,360 --> 08:09:10,798
hard

8659
08:09:10,798 --> 08:09:12,320
and then eventually i put a video in

8660
08:09:12,320 --> 08:09:13,520
here

8661
08:09:13,520 --> 08:09:14,798
that guy

8662
08:09:14,798 --> 08:09:17,200
is actually this guy same

8663
08:09:17,200 --> 08:09:19,040
right but

8664
08:09:19,040 --> 08:09:21,120
know your audience

8665
08:09:21,120 --> 08:09:25,039
my this is me being all like yeah

8666
08:09:26,080 --> 08:09:27,520
talking about things to swedish and

8667
08:09:27,520 --> 08:09:30,080
gothenburgian accent this is me doing

8668
08:09:30,080 --> 08:09:32,080
hacking stuff on the internet

8669
08:09:32,080 --> 08:09:35,120
same dude different brands

8670
08:09:35,120 --> 08:09:38,240
so that's why that is included there

8671
08:09:38,240 --> 08:09:40,000
and as you can see here

8672
08:09:40,000 --> 08:09:42,160
i'm ranking number one

8673
08:09:42,160 --> 08:09:43,520
it's that simple

8674
08:09:43,520 --> 08:09:45,360
it's not simple takes time and and you

8675
08:09:45,360 --> 08:09:47,520
need to write the blog post and and you

8676
08:09:47,520 --> 08:09:48,878
will ask yourself why would you go for

8677
08:09:48,878 --> 08:09:52,320
all this like why even bother you

8678
08:09:52,320 --> 08:09:56,160
because your research deserves views

8679
08:09:56,160 --> 08:09:58,398
you put a lot of hours in it

8680
08:09:58,398 --> 08:10:01,600
why not tweak the last ones and make

8681
08:10:01,600 --> 08:10:02,478
it

8682
08:10:02,478 --> 08:10:04,638
different make it stand out

8683
08:10:04,638 --> 08:10:06,398
deliver it that way you're gonna get

8684
08:10:06,398 --> 08:10:08,878
shares the way people gonna like and

8685
08:10:08,878 --> 08:10:11,760
enjoy your reading so proofread it once

8686
08:10:11,760 --> 08:10:13,600
more time ask somebody else to help you

8687
08:10:13,600 --> 08:10:17,520
out and don't do those 600 words medium

8688
08:10:17,520 --> 08:10:19,600
post where you talk about how cool you

8689
08:10:19,600 --> 08:10:20,398
are

8690
08:10:20,398 --> 08:10:22,878
provides no value

8691
08:10:22,878 --> 08:10:25,680
so all that is important

8692
08:10:25,680 --> 08:10:27,520
if you want to communicate with me you

8693
08:10:27,520 --> 08:10:29,600
can follow me on all social i have a

8694
08:10:29,600 --> 08:10:32,080

8695
08:10:32,080 --> 08:10:34,000
and that's it

8696
08:10:34,000 --> 08:10:35,760
thank you and welcome to contigration

8697

08:10:44,958 --> 08:10:48,798
we're in sweden i know no questions

8699
08:10:48,798 --> 08:10:50,638
thank you but if you have it if you want

8700
08:10:50,638 --> 08:10:52,638
to we can't have questions or you can

8701
08:10:52,638 --> 08:10:55,520
catch me in the bar outside or you can

8702
08:10:55,520 --> 08:10:58,798
ask him to get drink tickets yeah

8703
08:10:58,798 --> 08:11:00,718
because it's that time now i do have a

8704
08:11:00,718 --> 08:11:02,398
few

8705
08:11:02,398 --> 08:11:05,920
but do we have any questions anyone

8706
08:11:05,920 --> 08:11:08,558
raise your hands

8707
08:11:08,558 --> 08:11:10,840
you get one in the

8708
08:11:10,840 --> 08:11:14,240
back i do

8709
08:11:18,798 --> 08:11:20,718
yes

8710
08:11:20,718 --> 08:11:22,478
you don't need to can you ask the

8711
08:11:22,478 --> 08:11:23,760
question

8712
08:11:23,760 --> 08:11:26,558
okay so the question is to double down

8713
08:11:26,558 --> 08:11:29,040
on your search engine optimization you

8714
08:11:29,040 --> 08:11:31,360
need to do a youtube video you don't

8715
08:11:31,360 --> 08:11:32,878
have to

8716
08:11:32,878 --> 08:11:35,840
but it's preferred

8717
08:11:36,160 --> 08:11:39,160
yes

8718
08:11:42,638 --> 08:11:44,000
no

8719
08:11:44,000 --> 08:11:46,558
opposite if you embed it if you you put

8720
08:11:46,558 --> 08:11:47,760
it on youtube

8721
08:11:47,760 --> 08:11:49,200
that's where you want to put it because

8722
08:11:49,200 --> 08:11:51,280
youtube is the world's second biggest

8723
08:11:51,280 --> 08:11:52,958
search engine people search for

8724
08:11:52,958 --> 08:11:54,958
there so you want to be found there if

8725
08:11:54,958 --> 08:11:57,040
you put it on your website and some kind

8726
08:11:57,040 --> 08:11:58,320
of mpeg

8727
08:11:58,320 --> 08:12:00,000
what's going to happen is that you're

8728
08:12:00,000 --> 08:12:02,638
going to not be able to use the cdns

8729
08:12:02,638 --> 08:12:04,558
that youtube provides to get high

8730
08:12:04,558 --> 08:12:06,320
bandwidth that works with every kind of

8731
08:12:06,320 --> 08:12:08,320
platform that you use you own the

8732
08:12:08,320 --> 08:12:11,120
content of course sure i respect that

8733
08:12:11,120 --> 08:12:12,320
but you're probably going to name it

8734
08:12:12,320 --> 08:12:13,840
 anyway and it's going to be like

8735
08:12:13,840 --> 08:12:15,520
mp4 file and it's going to be playing

8736
08:12:15,520 --> 08:12:16,878
there in an embedded player that you

8737
08:12:16,878 --> 08:12:18,798
think are really cool but why not put it

8738
08:12:18,798 --> 08:12:20,160
on youtube in the first place and have

8739
08:12:20,160 --> 08:12:21,680
the possibility for it to be indexed by

8740
08:12:21,680 --> 08:12:23,040
a lot of people and what's going to

8741
08:12:23,040 --> 08:12:25,200
happen since youtube

8750
08:12:43,680 --> 08:12:46,398

let's do it let's do it thank you so

8753
08:12:50,638 --> 08:12:53,638
much

8754
08:13:41,520 --> 08:13:44,240
yeah yeah so it's getting close to that

8755
08:13:44,240 --> 08:13:46,000
time where we need to fill our stomachs

8756
08:13:46,000 --> 08:13:49,200
again yep with not only beer but actual

8757
08:13:49,200 --> 08:13:51,360
food this time yep

8758
08:13:51,360 --> 08:13:52,478
so

8759
08:13:52,478 --> 08:13:54,000
now we're going to do another game of

8760
08:13:54,000 --> 08:13:55,840
tetris because the other one was too

8761
08:13:55,840 --> 08:13:56,718
easy

8762
08:13:56,718 --> 08:13:57,920
yes so now we're going to do it

8763
08:13:57,920 --> 08:13:59,040
differently

8764
08:13:59,040 --> 08:14:00,638
because people told us that we should do

8765
08:14:00,638 --> 08:14:03,040
it differently yes we have instructions

8766
08:14:03,040 --> 08:14:05,440
from on high yeah so what's going to

8767
08:14:05,440 --> 08:14:07,680
happen now is that we're going to mingle

8768
08:14:07,680 --> 08:14:08,878
and we're going to do that in the

8769
08:14:08,878 --> 08:14:10,638
sponsor area

8770
08:14:10,638 --> 08:14:13,440
we will open the doors to dinner around

8771
08:14:13,440 --> 08:14:15,760
six

8772
08:14:15,840 --> 08:14:17,840
and then everyone

8773
08:14:17,840 --> 08:14:19,120
take a seat

8774
08:14:19,120 --> 08:14:21,520
you don't go to the food you take a seat

8775
08:14:21,520 --> 08:14:22,718
first

8776
08:14:22,718 --> 08:14:26,240
sit down and chill yes until instructed

8777
08:14:26,240 --> 08:14:28,638
to do something else and those

8778
08:14:28,638 --> 08:14:31,280
instructions will probably be that the

8779
08:14:31,280 --> 08:14:33,840
table at the far end gets up gets their

8780
08:14:33,840 --> 08:14:36,240
food and then we carry on

8781
08:14:36,240 --> 08:14:37,680
if you're really hungry sit at the far

8782
08:14:37,680 --> 08:14:39,520
end that's what i'm saying yeah so but

8783
08:14:39,520 --> 08:14:41,200
we want everyone to get seated first and

8784
08:14:41,200 --> 08:14:43,200
then we go in sections in order to have

8785
08:14:43,200 --> 08:14:44,798
a pleasant dinner experience for

8786
08:14:44,798 --> 08:14:47,440
everyone yes and then there is a bunch

8787
08:14:47,440 --> 08:14:49,840
of shenanigans going on

8788
08:14:49,840 --> 08:14:52,240
we just failed the fire inspection

8789
08:14:52,240 --> 08:14:54,958
more info will follow so we rearranged

8790
08:14:54,958 --> 08:14:58,080
that but there will be fire

8791
08:14:58,080 --> 08:15:00,718
yes so uh watch your eyebrows yeah so we

8792
08:15:00,718 --> 08:15:02,878
have uh a lot we have security guards

8793
08:15:02,878 --> 08:15:05,120
and we have a cool little

8794
08:15:05,120 --> 08:15:08,160
don't go beneath this point things

8795
08:15:08,160 --> 08:15:10,558
guess what don't go beneath that point

8796
08:15:10,558 --> 08:15:12,318
yeah i mean because things is getting

8797
08:15:12,318 --> 08:15:15,120
hot exactly at pain of

8798
08:15:15,120 --> 08:15:17,520
severe burns yeah

8799
08:15:17,520 --> 08:15:19,760

8800
08:15:19,760 --> 08:15:23,079
