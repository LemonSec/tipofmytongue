00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,420
 Hello everyone. My name is Adam Ruddermann, I came to talk about 

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,900
 how to use Bug Bounty to get a job in Silicon Valley. 

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,520
 So let's start. 

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,000
 Nice to meet you, call me rudd. My name is Adam Ruddermann, but there are millions of Adams in the world. I was 

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,340
 of the United States Army, so I do not call my first name a long time ago. 

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,240
 A little about me and why I'm here. I started 

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,120
 in the United States Air Force. I was technical leader in the Red Team of the NSA (National Security Agency). 

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,199
 Basically, we could attack everything in the .mil domain, it was a lot of fun. 

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,540
 I worked on the Joint Task Force - Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) 

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:58,360
 who became the US Cyber ​​Command. So I helped set up the cyber-commando network defense. 

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,560
 After that I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton 

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,360
 in several contracts for the US Government making strategic cyberoperations 

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,420
 and operations management consulting. 

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:19,620
 I did not leave the government. I talked to a friend who was one of the founders of Synack, one of the three big Bug Bounty startups I'll tell you about later. 

15
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:25,300
 I asked for resume tips because I wanted to leave the government, and he offered me a job. So I was one of the employees there. 

16
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:31,240
 I had a child. And I went to Facebook. Much of my time on Facebook was not for Bug Bounty, though I was hired for it. 

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,660
 Most of my time was for data protection of users. Was not... 

18
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,520
 very popular at the time, but it's a big deal now. 

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,039
 The NCCGroup invited me to stay ahead of the Bug Bounty services for one of the 

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,320
 original providers of Bug Bounty services in the industry. We stayed there 

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,440
 providing team expansion and strategic support for some Bug Bounty programs many years ago. 

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,120
 So, a little about me. 

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,440
 So before we go into details about exactly 

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,759
 how to use Bug Bounty. What is Bug Bounty? 

25
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,100
 Basically what happens is: you can use any word you want, 

26
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,500
 some companies call security researcher, some white hats, some hackers, 

27
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,120
 Those who wear suits and pay bills call them "damn children and millenials" 

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,540
 They encounter vulnerabilities in organizations, by accident or on purpose, 

29
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,799
 and then spread the vulnerability to the organization. 

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,300
 Ideally responsibly, it gives you the opportunity to fix the bug. 

31
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,820
 The goal is not just to find bugs, it is to fix them to make things better. 

32
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,600
 And then the organization might give a reward. 

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,340
 On a high level this is it, but there are many details about it. 

34
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,299
 What's up? 

35
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,920
 So why do we care about it, and why is it relevant to you? 

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,119
 These are just examples. You know most of these logos. 

37
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,700
 All these organizations have some Bug Bounty program. 

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,339
 Many people make lots of money from it. I was driving 

39
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,660
 the Facebook Bug Bounty program, and was happy to pay, often ... 

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,600
 A million dollars a year while I was there, and 

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,280
 Google, well ... Facebook paid 5 or 6 million dollars, 

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,960
 Google paid a lot of money, Uber already paid a little more than 1.5 million dollars, 

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,940
 the US Department of Defense, for "Hack the Pentagon" 

44
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,260
 already paid enough money, I think about 500 thousand dollars. 

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,880
 So there are many opportunities, and these are just a few logos. So just so you know. 

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,920
 But let's be tactical. How does this look? 

47
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,040
 These are the pages of Uber and Twitter's Bug Bounty programs. 

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
 It's all there. You can literally go there, 

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,920
 see which parts of the project you can attack, and in what ways, and then 

50
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,339
 click "Submit a Report". That's it. And you are submitting a vulnerability 

51
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,520
 for Uber or Twitter. And it's incredible. The security field was very successful in this. 

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,260
 Uber has published what they call the "Treasure Map" 

53
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,500
 which gave an insight into how your product works, 

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,100
 to allow researchers, people they do not know, to find vulnerabilities in their products. 

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,680
 A report is like this. Again, make things tangible 

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,140
 This is cool. The cool part of Bug Bounty is that ... Snapchat is on the HackerOne platform 

57
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,900
 and this bug is public. I did not need special access to find him. Has the bug been fixed? 

58
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,500
 They just closed the bug for other people to see. 

59
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,420
 This is a phenomenal way to improve security in the world as it promotes transparency. 

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,300
 And Bug Bounty is fast. Look at this. 

61
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,900
 7 hours. This is crazy. 

62
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,359
 If you're doing intrusion testing - that's the main activity of NCC, and I support this 

63
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,820
 and invasion tests take place in this area - 

64
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,680
 but the reality is that Bug Bounty is phenomenal to narrow the gap between intrusion tests. 

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,160
 And you can make good money from it. Without complaining, there are 15 thousand. 

66
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,620
 It's incredible. 

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,880
 When I was on Facebook, I paid $ 10,000 to a 10-year-old for finding an incredible bug. 

68
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,780
 You could delete a comment 

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,840
 of a user in another user's Instagram. So imagine Taylor Swift 

70
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,060
 commenting on a post on Connie's Instagram and out of nothing the comment disappears. 

71
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,400
 Not good. 10 year old child found? 

72
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,340
 He won $ 10,000. He met the Prime Minister of Finland. This child goes far. 

73
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,620
 Abuse of user data is something important on Facebook now. This is something I like. But this is incredible. 

74
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,840
 HackerOne is probably the biggest platform today. 

75
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,440
 In the first 3 or 4 years they paid 20 million dollars for bugs 

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,620
 and in the next 4 years they plan to pay another 80 million. 

77
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,440
 That's 80 million dollars available for people to pick up. 

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,360
 Literally, they are paying $ 80 million. Go get it. 

79
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,239
 Okay, I hope you're interested now. There is money on the table, 

80
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,260
 no one to stop them. It's all about you, what is it? 

81
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,920
 Incredible and I love it. So how do I get started? I'm waiting for the translator to follow. 

82
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,739
 Let's start simply. I'll assume you know very little, which is OK. 

83
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,460
 There are several sandboxes for you to start learning web security. We have Google Gruyere, it's 

84
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,739
 a Swiss cheese because it has holes in it, so it is vulnerable. 

85
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:48,080
 And there are also the iOS and Web Vulnerable Applications, which are great products for you 

86
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,400
 practice on your time and learn how to hack Web applications and iOS. 

87
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,260
 I mentioned platforms; then Bug Bounty works like this: 

88
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,719
 the company says "I want a Bug Bounty program". If it's not Facebook, Google or Microsoft, 

89
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,460
 and without a considerable engineering support, 

90
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,020
 they go to one of these platforms to host their 

91
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,020
 pages of the program, with rules and scopes, 

92
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,659
 and is a communication platform to submit your bugs 

93
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,100
 and have a safe and consistent conversation 

94
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,840
 and also have recognition, something about which we will speak later. 

95
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,340
 In fact, I have no opinion on which is the best. I worked for Synack, which does not host public programs 

96
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,340
 Cobalt makes invasion tests, 

97
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,320
 Bugcrowd and HackerOne make public programs. We'll talk about this later. 

98
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,220
 But it's all about money. If you are not in this for money, 

99
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,060
 Of course, it's great to build a reputation and increase your skills, 

100
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,040
 the important thing is: leverage Bug Bounty to make it a career. That is 

101
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,740
 what I want to talk about. Some people do it only sometimes, and that's great. 

102
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:03,200
 But you can make money. With the right incentives, you can do the right things and go after what gives the greatest return. 

103
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,500
 So how to start? Focus on programs that pay rewards. 

104
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:15,060
 You may think that going after those who do not pay rewards is easier because fewer people go after them. It is true... 

105
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,640
 But these programs may not be good, may have limited scopes, 

106
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,840
 and they may also be slow to respond, because they have not invested so much in this. 

107
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:35,539
 And you should make money because it will be sustainable for you. If you want a job in the security area and are using Bug Bounty 

108
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:43,559
 to enrich your CV, you should make money so that you do not fall behind and have to find something else to do. 

109
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,180
 One exception: government programs do not pay, as they have a unique situation, 

110
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,520
 Government programs are very impressive, and look great in your CV. 

111
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,140
 Another thing to focus on: 

112
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:06,120
 there are thousands of bugs out there. You will see several incredible vulnerabilities that have been found and everyone talks about them on Twitter, people talking about Black Hats, 

113
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,580
 Start simple. Focus on OWASP Top 10. If you do not know what it is, literally go Google and look for OWASP. 

114
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,540
 So focus on mobile and web applications first. The reason is that, technically, 

115
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,420
 and many bugs look similar. 

116
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,760
 A CSRF bug often looks like another CSRF bug. 

117
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,020
 So it's easy for you to find, make money and increase your skills 

118
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:36,199
 and learn to find certain classes of bugs over various products and technology stacks. 

119
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,920
 Another great trick - this is the next topic I'm going to talk about - it's 

120
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,060
 Some of the biggest hackers post at all times and talk about their findings after they've fixed it. 

121
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:55,380
 So if you do not know what kind of bugs to look for, if you do not know what Cross-Site Scripting or SQL Injection is, 

122
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,880
 but there is more to it. These guys talk about what they find, and sometimes they're complex, and pretty cool. 

123
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:09,520
 So, look them up on Google, and seeing your tweets is a good way to learn what types of bugs you could look for. 

124
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,640
 So if you pay attention and really try, 

125
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,100
 and if you're really taking it seriously, 

126
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,040
 some things will happen. 

127
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,719
 First, you will quickly notice what you do not know, which is great. You need a little insight. 

128
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,060
 You'll also notice which types of bugs matter to businesses and which ones do not. 

129
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,219
 The reality is that when you are new to the area of ​​security, 

130
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,920
 everything seems important and serious. 

131
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
 And this is ... true. 

132
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,540
 If you have ever used a web scanner, they are notorious for this - web scanners are 

133
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,880
 give hundreds and hundreds of vulnerabilities to companies. Most of them are theoretical. 

134
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,960
 If you are trying, you will notice fast what you do not know. 

135
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,300
 This includes finding your own bugs, but also 

136
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,219
 try to find the same kinds of bugs that more experienced researchers have found. 

137
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,479
 And, if you're really trying, you should take it seriously because it's a job. 

138
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,960
 Follow it. If you find something you do not understand, write it down. I personally use Excel spreadsheets, 

139
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,700
 so I can prioritize this list. Sometimes 

140
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,120
 there are things like "What do I learn next?" And I simply 

141
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,660
 I see something I do not understand and I go back. This has worked well for me professionally. 

142
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,000
 And just challenge yourself. 

143
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,020
 In Bug Bounty, it's easy to just find CSRF bugs, only finding Cross-Site Scripting bugs. 

144
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,780
 Challenge yourself, especially if you want to make a career. 

145
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:47,620
 You will get good money only by encountering the same bugs because there are hundreds of programs out there. 

146
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,560
 But if you want a job, you need to be more balanced. 

147
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,420
 Companies look for more than that, and you need to challenge yourself. 

148
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,720
 Let's say you will do this for a while. Give yourself 6 months. 

149
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,880
 You are finding bugs consistently, doing a good job, 

150
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,080
 and wants to challenge himself more. 

151
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,200
 To do this - what happens when you have a good reputation on BugCrowd or HackerOne. 

152
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,040
 What happens when you have a good reputation 

153
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,199
 is that you are invited to private programs. 

154
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,680
 And there are far more private than public programs. 

155
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,640
 There are better payouts, 

156
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:34,480
 and private programs often have larger scopes and more interesting targets. 

157
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,680
 And there are more advanced private than public programs. The symbol on the left is the Facebook Bug Bounty program. 

158
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,060
 This is Google's Bounty Bug program. They call it Google VRP. 

159
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,880
 And there's Microsoft, Uber and others that are great advanced programs to learn. 

160
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,340
 This is the example of Frans Rosen, a Swedish friend of mine. That's his reputation, that's what I'm talking about. 

161
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,220
 He is one of the best known researchers. 

162
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,480
 This guy makes a lot of money finding bugs, and he travels the world now 

163
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,540
 such as a Bug Bounty Hacker. You will find it on Instagram, it goes to incredible places. 

164
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,480
 The benefit of challenging yourself is that there is gamification on these platforms. That is 

165
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,940
 of gamification, you get insignias and such. It's crazy. 

166
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,920
 You can do a lot to build your reputation and prove yourself publicly. 

167
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,439
 with Bug Bounty. And catch the attention of companies, companies in San Francisco. 

168
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,400
 Then you advance in these programs, you succeed in them. 

169
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,939
 What happens? You need to dig deeper. 

170
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,240
 You need to dig deeper and prove that you know their technological heap. 

171
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,680
 What a company looks for when hiring a Product Safety Engineer, which is in fact 

172
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,580
 which I am suggesting, the career of Product Safety Engineer. 

173
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:05,080
 They do not want you to know all about their technological heap on the first day. This is unnecessary, not expected. 

174
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:11,560
 They want to see that you can adapt. And this is an example of Facebook, 

175
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,739
 Facebook lives on the Graph API. All you do is with the Graph API, and it's a unique API. 

176
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,520
 And this is a screenshot of their site, you can mess with it now. 

177
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,079
 And there are researchers out there who know the Graph API better than Facebook. 

178
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,460
 And they handle a lot. 

179
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,040
 They do a good job finding bugs, and they make lots of money. They find the most complex bugs. 

180
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,900
 And this is a simple example, from which I can show a screenshot. 

181
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,600
 But the reality is that there are many such examples, in which you can demonstrate deepening. 

182
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,160
 and experience without the help of anyone. Just go there and do it. 

183
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,540
 Another person I told you about, this is Philippe. 

184
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,959
 One of the best hackers that Facebook has. He focuses on this program, especially. 

185
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,300
 He makes a lot of money, he knows more about some products than the engineers. 

186
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,319
 Honestly. He knows the APIs, submits the bugs and asks questions. 

187
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:18,560
 And he's very transparent about what he does, and he helps the community. Post videos of everything you do and teach you how to find bugs. 

188
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,360
 Cool, you can find bugs and you're very good at it. But can you fix them? 

189
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,200
 The problem of finding bugs is reactivity, and companies want to be proactive. They want to prevent bugs. 

190
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,660
 And while some companies have internal teams for intrusion testing, 

191
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,080
 what happens is something like "This person is a great pentester" 

192
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,460
 but to hire her, she can also fix bugs. 

193
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,580
 Well, knowing how to fix bugs means you can work with engineering teams and help them improve. 

194
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,880
 and help them make software safer. 

195
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,460
 and work with them without judging them, and this is critical. Let's talk about this soon. 

196
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,580
 And also, if you can write code, you will get paid better, which is way better than being a pentester. 

197
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,440
 Again, let's assume you know very little about this. What to do? 

198
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,120
 Let's say you do not know anything about software engineering. Crawl. Reinvent the wheel. If you do this often, 

199
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,760
 you'll use tools, some with open source, easy to find. 

200
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,340
 Automate something that is already automated, just for you 

201
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:35,080
 try and see how other people did. It's a great opportunity to learn, there are several quick tools. 

202
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,320
 Inevitably, if you do it seriously, you will find a process of your own, 

203
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,420
 which is manual and you can automate. 

204
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,740
 This is difficult in the beginning, especially if there is no model to copy, 

205
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,880
 but it's a great way to stay in the middle, and you can post something. 

206
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,640
 if you can leave it tidy. And it's a way to make your name. 

207
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,420
 And if you want to run - this is extreme, hardcore nightmare level, okay? I... 

208
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,500
 few can do this, but it is the maximum level, 

209
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,020
 Google has Patch Rewards. There are several pieces of code 

210
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,900
 open for which Google pays Bug Bounty rewards 

211
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,920
 if you submit and have your submission submitted. 

212
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,599
 Now you must trim your edges. Nice. 

213
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,959
 You find and fix bugs. 

214
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:31,280
 But that does not mean being a good employee. You can communicate, you can help people, you can 

215
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,639
 to set up a security program? Then you need to trim the edges. 

216
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,660
 Write bug reports in detail. 

217
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,100
 Detail how you found them, the impacts. It's very important. 

218
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,440
 Show that you can help others, do trainings 1 to 1. You have a friend who 

219
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,880
 works in a medical laboratory and wants to make more money, and wants to go in for safety. 

220
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,260
 Help him out. Challenge yourself. 

221
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,060
 And give lectures. There are several examples of how to give lectures, and 

222
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,139
 in Brazil, I have a friend from Sao Paulo who gave me a huge list 

223
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,860
 of Hacker Clubs around the city, are everywhere 

224
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,439
 of Brazil. These are places where you can learn 

225
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,080
 and help others, and continue to challenge and grow as a speaker. 

226
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,600
 Important, and we will have an adult conversation about it. 

227
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,939
 You need to be professional, okay? 

228
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,680
 For even if you do not work for this company, 

229
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,420
 does not mean you have the right 

230
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,560
 to be rude or mean. This is not how the world works, 

231
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,240
 especially if you want a job. If you do not want to, you can even do this, but there are consequences as well. 

232
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,720
 Look this. We're having fun, I'm using 

233
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,580
 shirt, wearing my old sneakers because they said it was going to rain, 

234
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,360
 It's all right, right? But the reality is that 

235
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,120
 the people on the other side of submission are dealing with so much more than you. 

236
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,419
 I have some screenshots of a lecture I gave, for new clients, 

237
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,680
 to manage your levels during presentations. 

238
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,600
 That's what they deal with every day. Deal with 

239
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,040
 lawyers, executives, public relations, 

240
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,080
 if they are meeting Service Level Agreements with other companies, 

241
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,220
 and what charges occur if they do not reach SLAs. 

242
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,460
 Partnerships with engineering, all sorts of things. They are busy. 

243
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,480
 And they do not have time for bullshit. They have time for professionals who want to help them be successful. 

244
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,080
 Look from a legal perspective. This is a nightmare. 

245
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,879
 It's not fun at all. 

246
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,820
 So, 

247
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 On the other side of submission are people like that. But those are your contacts, your mentors. 

248
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,980
 They are people who will recommend you and will be your contractors. 

249
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,240
 It's who's there So even if you do not want to join Facebook, Google or something, 

250
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,420
 they know each other. Some time ago they were 10 minutes by car from each other, it was funny. 

251
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,120
 The reality is they need to like you. 

252
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,379
 They do not need to like you as a person, but they need to like you as a professional. 

253
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,379
 Super important. 

254
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,380
 For behind them there are people who look like this. 

255
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,340
 And these people do not have time for drama. They want professionals. They are willing to pay money, 

256
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,540
 they want to pay him the righteous. But they do not have time for bullshit, let's face it. 

257
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,460
 A key aspect of communicating with these teams 

258
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,500
 is to understand the real impact of their bugs. 

259
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,540
 CVSS is not a good indicator of impact. So, it is valid on some points, but for most security issues it is not. 

260
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:48,020
 Be realistic. Cool, you've encountered a "Reflected Cross-site scripting" 

261
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,159
 OK. 

262
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,120
 So often it's no big deal. Sometimes it is, sometimes it is not. 

263
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,820
 It depends on the company. 

264
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,180
 The important thing, what companies want to see in a person 

265
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,620
 with a good history of Bug Bounty, is that you understand the 

266
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,120
 context and impact of the bug to them. 

267
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:14,580
 An important bug for one company is not for another, and that's the reality. And there are good reasons for that. 

268
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,899
 Understand priorities. There is a lot going on, and priorities change at any time. 

269
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,320
 A good example: a screenshot of all the unique Bug Bounty programs that Microsoft is hosting right now. 

270
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,879
 There are start and end dates for Microsoft Bug Bounty programs. 

271
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,960
 And if you stay out of those end dates ... 

272
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,140
 I'm sorry. 

273
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,960
 The reason is that it is a massive engineering company. Need to keep an eye on Bug Bounty and resources 

274
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,040
 needed to fix the bugs. Bug Bounty programs exist to find bugs and fix them, 

275
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,700
 do not collect them and keep looking. 

276
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,060
 Then they will sometimes get Bug Bounties if they know they will be able to fix them. 

277
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,460
 As I said before: treat as a job, 

278
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,840
 follow the rules. Programs have rules for a reason, 

279
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,459
 follow them. You do not help anyone by disobeying these rules. 

280
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,440
 They are not trying to limit you, 

281
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,760
 are dealing with barriers. Usually legal barriers, 

282
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,720
 Communicate professionally. Imagine you're talking to your boss. Talk in a professional way. 

283
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,400
 And listen to your audience. She gives feedback. "We think it has no impact because of it," "We think it's not valid because of that." 

284
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,480
 Is everything alright there? OK] 

285
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:37,320
 Listen to them and receive feedback. They are not trying to fool you or be hard-boiled. 

286
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,860
 And this creates mutual trust and respect. 

287
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,659
 and helps you create local and global relationships. 

288
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,880
 The person with whom I spoke to redo the Facebook Bug Bounty program is Brazilian. 

289
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,320
 That's why I'm here, she introduced me to the people here. 

290
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,879
 So, this community is great, but you need to calm down and understand what's important. 

291
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,460
 That this happens if you do not understand. This is a submission to Uber's Bug Bounty program. Famous on the internet. 

292
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,320
 He was out of scope, out of the rules. The report was not valid because it was out of scope. 

293
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,360
 "This domain is not valid for Bug Bounty submissions". Very straightforward. It's on their page. 

294
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,460
 He did not like it, and he decided, well ... 

295
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,720
 call all Uber "**** kids and taxi drivers". 

296
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,500
 And last and very important: you need to speak English. 

297
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,540
 I know it sucks a lot of people, 

298
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,240
 I'll be honest: I'm lazy, I only speak English. 

299
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,360
 Sorry ... but many people on the other side of this 

300
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,520
 speak English. I do not want you to say that even Obama, a great American speaker, 

301
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,020
 I do not care if you speak like the queen. 

302
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,540
 I do not mind you talking like this guy. You just have to be clear. 

303
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,760
 And professional. And do not talk like this guy. 

304
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,680
 Because, really. This is what you saw 

305
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,360
 This happens when you behave like this. 

306
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,500
 That happened to this guy. He was banned from the Uber program and suffered additional penalties from HackerOne. 

307
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,940
 I hope it was worth it for disrespecting Uber's guys. 

308
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,960
 For he is gone. 

309
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,660
 This is the reality. 

310
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,880
 So briefly. 

311
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,420
 One more thing came from my friend Reginaldo. 

312
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,260
 Maybe Silicon Valley is not for you. He loves Brazil. 

313
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,520
 Sometimes he says, "I want to go home," because he lives in San Francisco now. 

314
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,240
 He had the biggest pay for Facebook at the time. He was offered a job, and he accepted. 

315
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,380
 And that's straight from him. 

316
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,159
 A quote I took from him yesterday. 

317
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,540
 "Working in Silicon Valley is great, but it may not be your goal." 

318
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,820
 "Make Bug Bounty and be paid in dollars living in Brazil 

319
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,020
 "It's really cool, and it's not that hard to do." 

320
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,300
 With that, I want to thank you for your time. 

321
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,540
 Focus on impact, not what looks cool. Focus on impact 

322
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,300
 and we will help the internet to be a safer place. 

323
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,340
 Thank you.
