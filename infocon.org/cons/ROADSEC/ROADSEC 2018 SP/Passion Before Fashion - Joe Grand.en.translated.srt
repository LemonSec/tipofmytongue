1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,760
 You make noise, wow! 

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,200
 Thank you, thank you for coming. My name is Joe Grand. 

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,460
 and this will probably be the less technical talk of the day. 

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,460
 Because I think their brains are tired. Yeah, okay. 

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,740
 I think there is no technology here. 

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,739
 This presentation is basically 

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,060
 stories of someone growing up in the hacker world 

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,640
 at a time when hackers were not as well understood as today, 

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,840
 on the good or bad side, were not understood. 

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,100
 So I'm going to talk about stories from that time, some projects I worked on, 

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,640
 and, in fact, the moral of all this is 

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,780
 that you need to find what you love to do, 

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,200
 no matter what others say, and you will end up being successful. 

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,440
 what is your definition of success. 

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,019
 And you will see what I mean as we continue. 

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,240
 I'll start with a figure. 

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,679
 I got involved with computers in 1982, and 

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,400
 I was 8 years old, I was very happy, I made a drawing of the Atari 400 computer. 

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,600
 How many here made a drawing of your first computer? 

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,399
 Please, somebody did it. Nobody?! 

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,920
 IBM PC? Not? 

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,740
 So, yes, computers are my life. It's all I've always done. 

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,119
 and it was something that made a "click" as soon as I 

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:42,280
 I discovered computers, I knew it was what I wanted to do. Computers and, with that, electronics as well. 

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,040
 I was that child with big thick glasses 

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,880
 my parents worked, so I walked home and the computer was my nanny until the end of the day. 

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,119
 I started playing video games; 

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,060
 I had a brother six years older than me and it was my inspiration, he taught me how to use a computer. 

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,660
 And he began to be bored, and 

30
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,799
 became a musician. That was good because I inherited all your records, everything. 

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,600
 Here I am a few years later, and this is 

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,540
 when I discovered the Bulletin Board Systems, the systems that you connected via modem, well before the internet. 

33
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,560
 but a very similar concept, you connect two computers. 

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,340
 And it's something that, if you had a computer at the time, 

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,360
 you only dealt with other computer enthusiasts, 

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,320
 other people interested in computers. There was no industry for computer security. 

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,760
 The internet at that time was very, very simple. The ARPANET 

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,840
 it was just a bunch of machines in connected universities. 

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,240
 And the hacker community was just a bunch of kids in their parents' rooms and holds 

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,000
 exploring computers. It was just that. 

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,320
 There was no goal like "I'm going to grow up and become a hacker, I'm going to make a career breaking systems." That was not the case. 

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,920
 It was just really cool. 

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:14,420
 One of the problems with Bulletin Board Systems was that you used the phone line, and a call that was not local was very expensive. 

44
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,880
 Then, at age 10, I figured out how to make my first free phone call 

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,240
 to connect to distant Bulletin Board Systems and get better games, 

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,220
 because each local group had different games. And that did not seem wrong to me. 

47
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:37,480
 It seemed normal. "Use this access code, call this number, enter this code, and get a free call." It made sense. 

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,700
 I did not even think of it as being illegal, and today I still do not think so. 

49
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,739
 After all, big companies controlling the phone system deserve to be rigged. 

50
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,860
 But that set the stage for what was to come: my love of electronics 

51
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,480
 And my love for computers. I tried to program, so I'll show my first 

52
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,780
 program, I think I was 8 years old, it was 1993. Did anyone see Dr. Who? 

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,000
 Yes? Good dog, huh? K-9 

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,220
 it was the dog, I thought it was really cool. So I wrote a program in BASIC 

55
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,000
 and I learned hexadecimal 

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,620
 when messing with computers, because I modified the crack screens, 

57
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,980
 you know, those who said "Ninja Cracked Game" or whatever, 

58
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,400
 I opened the HexEditor and changed the values ​​without knowing that I was modifying hexadecimal, 

59
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,960
 and modifying ASCII, but changed the screen; I was the BlackNinja at the time, so I wrote "Modified by BlackNinja". 

60
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,900
 But I was just stirring. Anyway, this is the program, let's see. 

61
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,880
 I had the home screen here, and 

62
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,719
 warning that we do not know how the audio will come out, because we did not test. It can get loud, so be prepared to plug the ears. 

63
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,900
 Because there's sound here too. 

64
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,680
 I'll stop here. 

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,900
 This is the sound of K-9, if you remember. At least that's how I remember he sounded. 

66
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,120
 So... 

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,060
 After engaging with computers and Bulletin Board Systems, I began to discover an underworld, 

68
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,920
 where besides exchanging games, people exchanged 

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,140
 phone codes, passwords of other systems they encountered; it was just the progression 

70
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,460
 of using computers, and I kind of got involved in this life of technological "pranks". 

71
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,739
 I actually call it "youthful technology delinquency." 

72
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:39,440
 Because I was just a messy kid, but instead of creating problems personally, I did it on the computer. 

73
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,780
 And again, it seemed natural to me. 

74
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,500
 So - I do not know what happened to my head, it was cut off - 

75
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,580
 These photos were around my 13 years old, and 

76
00:05:52,580 --> 00:06:00,880
 besides being on the computer, which was a bad thing: if it was done back then, you were a nerd and nobody wanted to be with you, 

77
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,620
 I also liked skateboarding, which was bad, 

78
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,600
 I liked punk rock; then all these subcultures 

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,700
 It's funny because, looking back, I wonder how I got involved in it, 

80
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,180
 Why did the normal world seem so strange? 

81
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,360
 That's because I never fit into the normal world. 

82
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,420
 I was always attracted to these worlds where I could do what I wanted, say what I wanted and express myself as I wanted to. 

83
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:34,260
 And it happened to get involved in all these subcultures, which was funny. 

84
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,260
 The photo below to the right; it was a clothing store, I used to go there and 

85
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,120
 I'm going to talk about some things we did; but it was like a headquarters for me and my friends 

86
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,980
 in various malicious activities. 

87
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,020
 So tinkering with computers was one thing, 

88
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,000
 but electronics was another because computers were very basic platforms. 

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,920
 You wrote simple code, there was no room for abstraction. 

90
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,540
 and operating systems like today. You had operating systems but were low level 

91
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,640
 Then you could create hardware to interact with your computer. 

92
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,120
 But I was also interested in doing pranks with all kinds of hardware 

93
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,760
 I read electronics magazines and projects and figured out how to modify them to do something else, 

94
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,780
 and from there I built my own things. So it's not very different from today, 

95
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,460
 if someone says "I'm interested in networking, or in sniffing network traffic" 

96
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:39,979
 I will use existing tools first, then try on a system that has been hacked, and then modify to use on a different system. 

97
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,740
 It's kind of a process, just explore. 

98
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,400
 Some of these things; I do not know if you saw the talk about phone phreaking a few hours ago, 

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,900
 in which one of the devices they spoke to was the Red Box, 

100
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,219
 a way to get free calls by mimicking the sound of the chips being placed on the phone. 

101
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,240
 Here in the figure below I can not see, 

102
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,600
 It was cut because it blurred, my camera was not good at the time. 

103
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,380
 But this is a little circuit that made a tone and I put it on a pager, like those used on the waist, 

104
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,880
 and I was going around normal, and I used it on a pay phone to get free calls. 

105
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,900
 I ended up selling them in high school for a lot of people, and I made some good money. 

106
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,419
 There are other phreaking devices and the like, above is a universal garage control, 

107
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:33,840
 Normal garage doors have a transmitter that you put in the car and a receiver in the garage door; 

108
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,420
 and you program a password on the transmitter so that it sends the signal to the receiver. 

109
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,540
 What I did was take out the buttons and put a circuit that generated all possible password combinations, 

110
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,599
 and you hold the button until he guesses the password and open the garage door. 

111
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,180
 I did not steal anything from the garages I opened. My wife does not believe me, but I did not really steal anything. 

112
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,739
 But it was about having the power. Have the skills and tools, know that you could, 

113
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,320
 as well as open locks, develop exploits, 

114
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,140
 usually you do not use it for malicious purposes, but having that power is legal. 

115
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,459
 This is a picture of ... I had books. 

116
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,020
 They were notebooks; as grafitti have notebooks with their tags and designs, 

117
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,360
 I had books full of passwords and phones 

118
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,720
 and other things that if I got caught up with them would be bad. Credit card numbers, 

119
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,660
 it was ridiculous. Stacks of notebooks. 

120
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:43,000
 And that was my engineering personality, keeping everything written carefully. What it's like when you hear that 

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,520
 members of organized crime being caught for having finances and personnel registered and you think "Why would they do this?" 

122
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,420
 "They're breaking the law, why would they document everything?" And it's the same process here. 

123
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,760
 Sometimes I had to hide everything, 

124
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,760
 at my brother's girlfriend's house because I thought the police were coming in, so I hid everything. 

125
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,000
 But it did not. However, what happened, moreover 

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,060
 I got caught up in a hacking group called "Renegade Legion," a group of young men playing tricks. We did fraud on credit cards, 

127
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,979
 more for ourselves. We did not usually sell credit cards. But again, we were a bunch of teenagers and 

128
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,360
 teenagers - I've been studying this because my kids are almost teenagers - 

129
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,280
 do not have the brain's ability to think about the future, think about consequences. 

130
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,040
 So when you see young people doing stupidity, you might think, "They still do not have brains" 

131
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,040
 And when I did that, I still did not have the mindset, I did not think. And in the end, 

132
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,040
 I was arrested. Good... 

133
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,439
 No big surprise. 

134
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,680
 Taking the photo of the inmate was incredible. In fact, I went to the police station where I was arrested, I wrote 

135
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,920
 I got a card and I got the picture. So I was 16 years old and 

136
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,300
 should imagine that I had problems with things related to computer, 

137
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,160
 such as telephone fraud, or teleconferences with a lot of hackers passing pranks on people, 

138
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,540
 pranks with computers. But what happened was that I invaded a telephone building 

139
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,219
 a real building, to have access to documentation, 

140
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,060
 tools and testing equipment to which a normal person would not have access. 

141
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,079
 Again, it seemed normal, I wanted to have access to those things. 

142
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,900
 I wanted to read about telephone networks, read about 

143
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,360
 how operators did things. Apparently it was better to have asked them instead. 

144
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,000
 So that was the turning point for me, where 

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I had a passion for electronics, hacking, all of this 

146
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,120
 but it was the wrong direction. And alright, if you start like this it's okay, if you can redirect yourself, 

147
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,200
 that's the key. And I think conferences like Roadsec 

148
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,300
 are perfect for this. It brings together the entire Brazilian community, the hacker community 

149
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,959
 and offers resources, and there are hiring companies, so it's really a place where 

150
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:11,180
 you have the opportunity to follow the right path. When I started I did not follow, but luckily, when I got into trouble, I did. 

151
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,720
 Another thing, when I had this problem, my parents did not say "You will not use a computer again" 

152
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
 because this would be the typical response. 

153
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,420
 They knew this was all I ever did, 

154
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,660
 and take that away from me would be a mistake, and I would revolt in another way 

155
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,560
 so they stood by me and said, "Okay, you were stupid" 

156
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,560
 "Let's see if anyone can help you better." 

157
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,040
 And there was a group called L0pht, a hacking group in Boston, and I'll talk about them in a second, 

158
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,920
 I've been involved with them since the early 1990s, 

159
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,979
 but they kept me away for a while, "We do not want him around, he's doing stupid things" 

160
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:03,040
 but when I had problems they let me in. They were older than me, so they were my mentors, and my parents paid the rent 

161
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,319
 my share of the rent to help me. Because, as a high school student, 

162
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,240
 $ 50 a month, which was not cheap. 

163
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,980
 And they paid for it, and kept me surrounded by mentors. And that was the key. 

164
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,460
 So this is a video that came out in 1994 talking about L0pht 

165
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,600
 L0pht was one of the first hacking groups that came to the public 

166
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,020
 and we like to say that we 

167
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,860
 we share the good side of hackers. The positive message of what hackers can do 

168
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,880
 from the technological point of view, of social change, 

169
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,240
 we try to educate the general public. 

170
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,440
 So we had a hacker club house, which I'll show in the video. So we 

171
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,820
 grew, and we began to do more things. 

172
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,400
 But it was always an organic process. We did not have a plan like 

173
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,640
 "Let's start a business and get rich." The part of getting rich did not happen. 

174
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,280
 Creating the company happened, but it was something natural. We did not have a plan. 

175
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,320
 Come on, see if it works. 

176
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,140
 Everything in the L0pht was carried by hand, by the ladder, 

177
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,840
 so remember that when you see the fans. Two fans. 

178
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,540
 Come on. 

179
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,060
 Some people have asked what exactly it is 

180
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,699
 the L0pht, and I say "it's like a club house" 

181
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,720
 except we do not have secret handshakes. 

182
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,460
 But we have friends visiting us from other places. 

183
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,860
 And they like computers, and it's a place where 

184
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,440
 we can bring them, and they can sleep here. 

185
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,780
 At first we were looking for a storage space 

186
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,959
 to store things, and became a 

187
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,780
 a strange and communal thing. 

188
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,520
 I've saved a lot of things for years. It's my basement here. 

189
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,720
 and I could not use it. Now I've been able to bring it to L0pht, and use it all and see what it can do. 

190
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,360
 Talking to someone over the internet and the person says "I have a question about blah-blah-blah and" 

191
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,480
 "I'll look in my manual." Here the handbook of another person is within reach. 

192
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,520
 Or ask in person. It is much easier to share information by speaking in person 

193
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,280
 You can get the hardware online and see what- 

194
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,860
 "I want to learn how to hack that right" "Come here, you can hack" "I do not care" 

195
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,040
 This is a project that I have been working on and 

196
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,860
 is basically a telephone dialer 

197
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,460
 such as a processor. It's like a Demon Dialer 

198
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,360
 hack-tech, and 

199
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,500
 creates all shades: Blue Box, Red Box, Green Box, 

200
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,200
 Access to technology is 

201
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,840
 centralized, a place where anyone can come 

202
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,880
 I'm an enthusiast, and 

203
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,560
 I learn. It's the most important thing, you come and learn about anything. 

204
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,219
 This is CountZero, one of the founders of L0pht 

205
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,940
 and what he said was important: "If you want to hack something, you can hack into our own network." 

206
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,180
 So having L0pht, having a hackerspace, I know there are some hackerspaces in Brazil 

207
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,319
 and if you want to get into that industry is a great way, join a hackerspace 

208
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:33,520
 set up your own network, your own software to hack, then you are not doing with someone else who can come get you. 

209
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,020
 It was a great resource for us to have a local hacker community 

210
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,060
 what happened was that we went to a second space 

211
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,719
 as we increase. AND 

212
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,300
 I'll see some pictures to show. It is similar, 

213
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,819
 a lot of junk. There is a little VAX that worked at some point. 

214
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,260
 Other pictures. We had decorations, magazines, arcade games 

215
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,340
 A hardware workstation. It had an old logic analyzer, an oscilloscope, 

216
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,480
 That video, I do not know if I spoke, was from Unauthorized Access, one of the first 

217
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,040
 documentaries on hackers in 1994. 

218
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,579
 Made by a woman named Annaliza Savage. And I think she's remastering 

219
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,099
 it speaks of hackerspaces and hacker groups all over the world, so 

220
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,099
 cool things coming from Europe at that time too. 

221
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,540
 We moved to this larger space 

222
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:28,339
 and in addition to sharing the positive message, we began to be known 

223
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,580
 our information files 

224
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,020
 and discover vulnerabilities in systems where, as we 

225
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,560
 We kept our group more cohesive, we stayed in seven. 

226
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,600
 Some people hardware, some software, 

227
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,520
 and we worked on our own projects. 

228
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,879
 And over time, some software guys who worked full-time with IT security 

229
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,040
 found vulnerabilities in systems in their jobs. 

230
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,260
 They told some stories about it, but the main thing is that 

231
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,800
 one of them went to Microsoft and found a vulnerability, I think it was 

232
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,320
 as the LanMan hashes were computed. 

233
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,159
 They said, "Hey, I know how we can break these passwords and find out 

234
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,900
 break the hashes and figure out the passwords, "and Microsoft said," Yeah, no one's ever going to do it. " 

235
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,080
 So they wrote an exploit code and said, "Well, this is how it happens" 

236
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,439
 And this was one of the first examples where this, 

237
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:31,900
 the complete disclosure, or responsible disclosure, that is, to help the seller fix the problem and then tell everyone about it. 

238
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,440
 But we had to force them to notice that there was a problem. 

239
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,360
 At other times, we would only advertise the ad without speaking to the seller, and he threatened to sue us 

240
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,620
 or just did not respond. And it was at a time when the software side, today, 

241
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,540
 disclosure of any order is common. We saw a full disclosure a few days ago 

242
00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:00,060
 and responsible disclosure. There are bug bounties in which companies actually accept that they have problems, so this is very good. 

243
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,760
 Anyway, this was how a website looked like in 1997. 

244
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,020
 Handmade in HTML. 

245
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,160
 I think the highlight of L0pht was the testimony in the Senate in 1998 

246
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,860
 in which we were questioned - and this was the first time a hacking group spoke to the Government 

247
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,040
 in a conversation, instead of the government coming and arresting them - 

248
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,399
 and I think, because of the publicity we've made over time 

249
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,640
 we were asked to testify about the situation of computer security, how bad was security. 

250
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,920
 This was 1998, the biggest 

251
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,160
 L0pht said "the internet can be knocked down in 30 minutes". 

252
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,100
 Which was one of many things said, but the media liked this part 

253
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,000
 but it was basically trying to educate their grandparents 

254
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,720
 about technical security stuff. And it was very difficult to do. 

255
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,660
 I did not really know the real impact of this until a few years ago, 

256
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,200
 because at the time I was young, I got lost and did not say anything 

257
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,120
 I did not notice how important that was, because now we're trying to educate 

258
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:20,360
 a part of the government, which some people and even I would choose not to do, but it was a good opportunity. 

259
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,600
 We were the first group to testify with our names hacker before the government 

260
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,760
 under the witness protection program, which I thought was really cool, because we were not running from anything. 

261
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,160
 And we had a follow-up of that 20 years later 

262
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,400
 a few months ago, to talk about: what has changed? Is security still poor? Can you still do all this? 

263
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,040
 And my answer is: yes, it's actually worse, 

264
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,639
 because there are more devices; more people; it is easy to do the "shotgun approach" and hit a lot of targets 

265
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,200
 at once; we have IoT devices, which is a nightmare 

266
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,480
 because they are computers with resource constraints. 

267
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,000
 We can not protect neither ordinary computers, as we will deal with these crude devices, 

268
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,220
 most are made in China and are connected to our network. It is incomprehensible. 

269
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:12,000
 Some people say it has improved, but I'm more of the cynical, skeptical side. 

270
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,980
 I'm going to show a funny video that came from this, a lot of media coverage about hackers, something like 

271
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,740
 we wanted to show that hackers were good. 

272
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,420
 That was Conan O'Brien on a Late Night Talk Show, one of the funniest I've ever seen. 

273
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:35,680
 I found it kind of terrifying, I read it in the news yesterday. A group of computer hackers 

274
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,840
 told Congress that hackers are capable of overthrowing the internet, 

275
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,540
 redirect commercial flights and transfer millions of Wall Street dollars around the world. 

276
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,540
 Bizarre, eh? What you mean 

277
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,040
 the only thing that hackers still can not do is lose their virginity. 

278
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,740
 There's a guy with thick black glasses crying. 

279
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,180
 now in the third row 

280
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,200
 and taking all the money out of their bank accounts. 

281
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,560
 I'm Screwed! 

282
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,100
 "I'll show that weird redhead" 

283
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,040
 I'm not afraid of nerds. 

284
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,020
 That was the bravest thing I ever said. 

285
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,540
 Sorry, I may be over the top, but I'm not afraid of nerds. 

286
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,399
 It is, then ... great media teasing us, big surprise. 

287
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,160
 Anyway, that was the high point, and we had a great idea of ​​"what if we could 

288
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,100
 continue to be hackers, do what we do and get paid for it? It would be incredible! " 

289
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,199
 So we decided to join forces with investors and start a business. 

290
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,800
 At that time, there was something like doing full-time research. 

291
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:13,919
 So we were rejected by the company about it, but we thought it was the right thing to do to drop our jobs and do that. 

292
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,940
 And at that time I graduated from high school, and we were all adults. 

293
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,880
 However, it turned out not working very well 

294
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,660
 because a group of friends who started with an ideal, 

295
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:33,260
 as hackers, hence the money came and changed a lot of the dynamics, several of us did not talk for a long time because now business was involved. 

296
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,760
 I do not say it would not work, but at that time it did not work. 

297
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,840
 And there are a whole set of stories related to this, 

298
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,860
 but this is a photo of L0pht, one of the photos I showed before, but now with all the junk removed. 

299
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,699
 And I did some of those pixifications, but I did not write "Sold". 

300
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:58,060
 And at that time the hacker community found it cool that hackers were 

301
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,760
 trying to make money from consulting firms, and others thought we were sold and compromised our ethics. 

302
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:10,600
 And I get somewhat in the middle if not agreeing with it. We thought we could do it, but we could not. 

303
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,900
 Then, advancing a little, and continuing the theme of 

304
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,880
 do what you love to do, I kept doing electronics, I left the security area for a few years. 

305
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,340
 and I started making electronics again, which is also my passion as well as computers. 

306
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,560
 And one day I got a call from people wanting to do a TV show 

307
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:38,919
 about creating crazy prototypes. So, just like in L0pht I had the opportunity to spread the hacker message, 

308
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,420
 Prototype This! was an opportunity to disseminate 

309
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:47,600
 the message of engineering, and inspire people to build their things instead of buying everything ready. 

310
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,000
 Even if what we built was ridiculous 

311
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,700
 a robotic nanny, 

312
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,700
 pizza delivery with automated car, all kinds of thing, I'll show you some. 

313
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,720
 But it was just so much fun. 

314
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,720
 and we do not have to compromise the way we normally work. 

315
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,399
 Here are 3-meter boxing robots who copied the players' movements out of the ring. 

316
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,860
 And I had a symbol on my back that 

317
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:20,199
 had some cameras, computer vision sensors, accelerometers in the boxing gloves, really cool. 

318
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,780
 Here is a computer-controlled 9-meter water slide. 

319
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,580
 Drops are, what? 30 seconds, something like that. 

320
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,980
 This was a 2-minute water slide, and it turned, went left and right, and projected images. 

321
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,900
 Totally ridiculous things, but things that should have been shown in schools 

322
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:45,080
 But the production made us destroy everything after each episode, that was pretty annoying. 

323
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,220
 For those who came to the small demonstration workshop about some hardware things 

324
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,380
 one of the parts I showed was actually the driver of that truck. 

325
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,880
 And it was a pickup truck that had legs coming out, getting up, 

326
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,580
 and we had omnidirectional wheels, that is, we could move the car in all directions. 

327
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,919
 The program was launched 10 years ago 

328
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,160
 in the United States. Internationally, it was ... 

329
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,580
 displayed from time to time, but you can go to your favorite piracy site 

330
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,639
 download and show your friends, your kids, whatever. 

331
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,820
 You have DVDs on Ebay too but it does not matter, 

332
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,740
 take it and distribute it at will. 

333
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:36,460
 Because it's still relevant, it's cool stuff. In fact, some of the projects we did and were 

334
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,460
 prototypes, just trying things, 

335
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,460
 companies took these ideas and turned them into real products. 

336
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,320
 Then you will see some similarities if you watch. 

337
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,800
 Here's one that I thought would be funny to show. So in addition to filming the program 

338
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,860
 we did funny things besides engineering stuff, 

339
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:01,580
 this was part of an episode where we made a personal airbag to protect from a fall of more than 9 meters 

340
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,919
 And we wanted to test the reaction and strength of a normal car airbag 

341
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:15,100
 which normally inflates in front of you. We thought it would be cool to get a doll the size of a child and put it on the airbag. 

342
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,980
 And for no reason, we just thought it would be cool. And here is the result. 

343
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,020
 Three two one... 

344
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,520
 Do not put your child in an airbag that way. It would be pretty bad. 

345
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,179
 The program was fun. 

346
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:51,180
 And after the program, same thing, keep building. I actually never ... 

347
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,300
 thought about... 

348
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,639
 Money was never the goal. And this is where I want to go, and I'll mention it later, and 

349
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,320
 Yes, it's good to make money and be able to support yourself, but 

350
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,100
 I do not mind making a lot of money. I want enough to survive 

351
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,879
 and do cool things I like to do. I tell people that I prefer to eat dog food. 

352
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,220
 to work in a company. And I know a lot of people can not do that, but 

353
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,240
 I just... 

354
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,700
 you do not have to sacrifice or compromise your ethics or morals to 

355
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,580
 be successful, or make money, or be happy, or anything. 

356
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,939
 Some other projects: DEFCON credentials at the top, 

357
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:40,560
 were the first electronic credentials at hacking conferences. I have them on display too. 

358
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,260
 Just another way to make people interested in electronics. 

359
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,800
 The L0pht was separate, the Prototype This! was separate, and the DEFCON credential combined hacker and electronics, which was pretty cool. 

360
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,060
 The JTAGulator. There was a talk on JTAG earlier, 

361
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,020
 use JTAG to extract device information, extract memory, 

362
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,520
 and this device facilitates, pro personal software, 

363
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,220
 find an interface on the hardware for you to explore the system. 

364
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,420
 And other different circuits, which I find fun or useful. 

365
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,620
 And not everything needs to be useful. 

366
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:20,699
 This is another video I posted. This is an experiment that 

367
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:28,880
 with facial recognition: OpenCV, facial recognition tools. There is facial recognition everywhere and this is terrifying. 

368
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,000
 and I used this as an excuse to play around a bit; I also do not have much experience with Linux, so 

369
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,960
 I had a BeagleBone Black, a kind of Linux system with Raspberry PI, and I moved a little with it, and 

370
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,720
 I created a system inside a Nintendo Virtual Boy console 

371
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,140
 which did not go very well in the 1990s when it was released. So I'll show you what he does. 

372
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,979
 He plays music. 

373
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,700
 But if you point the camera at a face 

374
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,000
 "moustache" 

375
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:10,120
 draws good mustaches, and you get points when you point the camera at a face, and by pressing the button you get more points. 

376
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,419
 I call it "Mojo" because everyone loves mustaches. 

377
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,340
 Sometimes hacking does not have to have a purpose, it does not have to be connected to security, 

378
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,620
 It can be whatever you want. You combine things, test something, 

379
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,979
 does not matter. You do what you want. 

380
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,940
 So I guess this is the summary of everything besides telling stories beasts, 

381
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:42,420
 the lessons; I usually give more technical lectures, so come and try to have something like 

382
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:47,280
 Philosophical insights about life is a little strange, so 

383
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,940
 but I tried. To love what you do is the main thing. 

384
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,800
 I mentioned that you do not have to compromise what you like to do, 

385
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:02,540
 maybe you need it at the beginning, and that gives you the impulse so that you break the barrier and do what you like. But it's very important. 

386
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,399
 continue to do what you love. 

387
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,920
 Do not forget the roots, no matter where they come from. I see this a lot in 

388
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,640
 in the information security community. Someone releases a ZeroDay or makes a presentation 

389
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,020
 and the media comes all "Wow, this is amazing!" 

390
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,700
 But we have to remember that there was someone before us 

391
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,760
 We are always on the shoulders of giants. Even L0pht having been the first public hacker group 

392
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,600
 does not mean that there were no hacking groups before him. The 414s of ... 

393
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,320
 they're going to kill me ... I think Wisconsin 

394
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,439
 Hacker groups have always been there, they just were not public. 

395
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,360
 But things change, and everyone who thinks they've found the best simply has not learned from history. 

396
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:55,060
 And the most important thing is to continue, we want our community to become this growing snowball, 

397
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,800
 but we have to remember where we came from and continue this, 

398
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,060
 even so that we are not swept to the corporate side, 

399
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:08,379
 because as the industry gets bigger, more corporate money is involved. What happened 

400
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:16,500
 in our consulting firm "@Stake", which came from L0pht, was that we were prevented from saying what we wanted because 

401
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,800
 what we wanted to say was about the companies that paid us. 

402
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,139
 And that stopped us from doing things. 

403
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,420
 So in the hacker community 

404
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:33,240
 we build on the work of people from past generations. No matter where you have entered the cyberspace security or hacker world, always 

405
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,360
 building on the work of other people. 

406
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,260
 That was my advice. And keep the hacker mentality. 

407
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:48,020
 It's something that ... if you're on Roadsec, you probably have. Or if you're just sneaking in 

408
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:54,160
 in hacking is something you can learn, and you see how important it is to question 

409
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:00,580
 and think critically. I would not talk about politics, but I know that you guys had political issues, the United States had political issues, 

410
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,659
 we do not know what information was real or not, 

411
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:09,920
 as hackers we can use our minds to distill this information and think about what is real and what is not. 

412
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:18,020
 Even use our mindset to educate other people to think differently and not just believe everything they see. 

413
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:25,040
 So that's the big scope beyond computing, electronics; there is more to it than that. We have real power 

414
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,300
 to change the world, to continue to change the world. 

415
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,720
 With this, before answering questions I mean 

416
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,800
 Thank you for listening, it was an honor. 

417
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,899
 come to São Paulo, I never came to Brazil, so it was incredible 

418
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:49,480
 the Roadsec community and Flipside, thanks to them for organizing this and bringing everyone together, it was very special 

419
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,920
 I went to conferences everywhere, but this really brings a good feeling. There is good energy, a lot going on. 

420
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,900
 And enjoy it, and keep it moving. And thank you!
