1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,160
 So we're going to talk about 

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,700
 mobility and the Internet of Things 

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,640
 You are a great market for mobility, so 

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,060
 if they are looking for a project 

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,540
 to enter invasion tests 

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,119
 or analysis of malware, or any type of hacking project 

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,100
 I know that mobility will be something, 

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,280
 will be very important here in Brazil. 

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,780
 Well, that's what I do, but I hope I can inspire them to do something. 

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,160
 The name of the talk, "The Perimeter Has Been Shattered!" ("The perimeter was broken!") 

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,879
 Let's talk about him. So we have a summary. 

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,700
 I will not read the summary; the slides are available online. 

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,300
 Unfortunately in English, but, 

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,319
 That's what we're going to talk about today. 

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,240
 You may have seen something like this, probably it was picked up from Cisco 

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,559
 this was really because the boxes in the diagram are blue, 

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,140
 but there must be something like that where you work. 

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:22,960
 A network diagram with all the assets you must protect if you are in an IT Security department. 

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,360
 It's a diagram with all the things we should keep safe 

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,600
 so that the company continues to function well. 

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,160
 Unfortunately this is not the complete view, that is, 

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,960
 what people generally think: desktops, Windows or Linux 

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,240
 there is probably some kind of domain, email servers, VPN, 

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,960
 and here in the corner, there is a 

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,779
 mobility and "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD). 

26
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,040
 BYOD is something very present in the United States, certainly here as well. 

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,260
 It is a way that companies have to avoid spending a lot of money 

28
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,460
 buying corporate cell phones when people already have personal cell phones. 

29
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,780
 So the idea is that you bring your own cell phone 

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,180
 to work, and install email, VPN, Sharepoint, things like that. 

31
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,080
 But it's just here in the corner of that typical network diagram 

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,320
 and unfortunately is often overlooked by security and IT staff. 

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,359
 It's something like "let's put it in a corner, buy some things, play on top ... 

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,700
 ... and hope that everything works out. "But in terms of testing, making corrections 

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,899
 or awareness of security, we tend to ignore it and focus on traditional workstations. 

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,180
 It may be that you work in a way different from mine, but I know that 

37
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,340
 I spend a lot more time on my personal devices than sitting at my desk at work. 

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,620
 At a workstation, solving a corporate problem. 

39
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,420
 It is no longer the way people typically work, 

40
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,320
 you go to the customer, or you go on trips like that. 

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,660
 If you are not from São Paulo, you have probably brought work with you. 

42
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,440
 If you're like me, I brought work only that is not over, but I'm going to finish it tonight. 

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,880
 You take work with you wherever you go. You may have rented a car 

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,840
 or use the WiFi of an airplane, or the WiFi of a train. 

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,400
 You can have meetings in cafes or restaurants 

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,160
 and use WiFi from there. 

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,500
 You may use some Software as a Service. 

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,560
 Probably not everything is done internally in your organization. 

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,780
 You may be able to contract email from Google or Microsoft. 

50
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:06,660
 It may be that you use Salesforce.com to keep track of the sales department's leads. 

51
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,140
 You probably use social media: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, all of these. 

52
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,700
 And everything is part of our corporate infrastructure, whether we like it or not. 

53
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,280
 We have all these accounts that employees have in these services. 

54
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:32,219
 You can also have cloud computing - Amazon, AWS, any of the other 

55
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,700
 in which you are actually using another person's system. 

56
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,060
 In all such cases, relying on other people to keep our network safe. 

57
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:50,960
 Because there is no control over the security of these other devices. We saw that Facebook was hacked a few months ago. 

58
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:59,580
 And some data was potentially lost. So if your employees use the same Facebook password in their corporate accounts, 

59
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:09,700
 and the password was stolen from Facebook, these accounts were compromised internally. And like the security team, you do not know that. 

60
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,320
 So in fact we can not ignore things like mobility, cloud and Internet of Things, 

61
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,140
 because they are part of how we work today, and are ways that our employees interact with our network 

62
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,240
 and with the whole world. 

63
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,440
 So, like the security department, we should start thinking about it very seriously. 

64
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,640
 So the threat model of a typical mobile device 

65
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:43,020
 is very similar to the threat model of a typical laptop or desktop, but with a few extras. 

66
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:51,380
 You still have the possibility of phishing, a great threat via email that we care about 

67
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:59,060
 on traditional devices - our users clicking on a link or downloading a program on a corporate computer. 

68
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:06,460
 The same can happen on a mobile device: they can be cheated in various ways for which they have not been trained. 

69
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:14,859
 It's a lot easier to leave your cell phone around than someone joining your company and stealing a server. 

70
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,920
 Of course it can happen but it is much easier with cell phones because they are with us everywhere, 

71
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,440
 are very small and can be left lying around. 

72
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,380
 People can steal them, they can look at someone typing. 

73
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,159
 And there are various types of connection - these devices are incredibly well connected. 

74
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,540
 The laptop typically has a wired connection and a wireless connection, and may have Bluetooth. 

75
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:49,100
 And these are the forms of communication. Mobile devices can communicate over Wi-Fi, cellular carrier, 

76
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,180
 they have NFC (Near-Field Communication), have Bluetooth, 

77
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,520
 have all these forms of communication, and all are potential attack vectors. 

78
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:07,039
 WiFi chips are attacked - we see this all the time - the chips inside the device are vulnerable to attack. 

79
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:14,280
 And there are apps too. Certainly people can download malware on traditional devices, 

80
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,960
 This happens, especially with phishing. 

81
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,599
 But with apps on mobile devices, it's 

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,900
 simply the way people are taught to use them. 

83
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,960
 Apple uses the slogan "There's an app for it." 

84
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:37,580
 And people hear that they should download an app for any problem they might think. 

85
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,400
 and there are tons of apps available. 

86
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:49,880
 And they make them believe that, particularly in the case of Apple devices, all available apps are safe. 

87
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,080
 And this is not necessarily always the case. 

88
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:01,979
 There are potential vulnerabilities in apps, and there are also malicious apps. 

89
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,520
 The problem, I think, is that 

90
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,020
 Mobility is a bit safer than what we are accustomed to. 

91
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:17,200
 We work by protecting Windows and Active Directory, and to some extent Linux, 

92
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,960
 for a long time. We had the way things were; we had the 

93
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,539
 for example, the antivirus. Let's get anti-virus as an example. 

94
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:37,740
 People in safety joke about antivirus because it is not, in fact, a silver bullet - and as we shall see, nothing is actually. 

95
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,760
 But the antivirus on a traditional Windows computer 

96
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,660
 he is very good at something very specific: finding idiot viruses. 

97
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,620
 It does not help catch sophisticated viruses at all. 

98
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,760
 For example, my mother likes to download games online. 

99
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,920
 She's a PhD in Computer Science, and that's why we fail in safety. There are very smart people 

100
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,900
 who should be safety experts. But not everyone can be an expert in security, and that's our job. 

101
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:19,079
 So my mom likes to download games over the internet, and there's always something extra along with the games. 

102
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:26,040
 And typically an internet game is not pushing hard. Then the antivirus on her Windows machine 

103
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,420
 takes the virus and cleans it. So in this case, the antivirus is very useful. 

104
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,219
 Of course, when mobile devices came on the scene, 

105
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,280
 the virus vendors said, "Okay, so instead of 

106
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:50,780
 1 license per user, we can have them install on your phone, tablet and laptop. That way, we'll get more money. " 

107
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:58,459
 Then they put the word "mobile" next to "antivirus", and the sellers now also had a product for mobile devices. 

108
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,920
 Unfortunately, all mobile devices 

109
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,260
 came after our PCs, so they were built with a bit of security in mind. 

110
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:18,960
 Even Android - Android has some bad reputation in security, but it has already progressed a lot from the beginning. We should also keep in mind that 

111
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,940
 in the first version of the iPhone, iOS version 1, everything ran as "root", including the browser. 

112
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,920
 which is terrible from a security perspective. 

113
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:36,060
 So as soon as they arrived, both Android and iPhone were not so good from the point of view of security. 

114
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:45,640
 But as they matured, they were including security in all layers. So we have from the hardware layer to the application layer 

115
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,520
 so they were safely developed in mind. So, going back to the antivirus example 

116
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:59,500
 they install an anti-virus app on the application tier on a mobile device. 

117
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,620
 In the worst case scenario, it is only able to detect itself and find out if it is a virus. 

118
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:12,300
 Which does not offer you much advantage as it is not able to look at other apps on the devices. 

119
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:19,859
 even for those the user has downloaded; he can not see what is happening, so it does not bring advantages. 

120
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:27,020
 If my mother downloads a game on her cell phone, the antivirus, even if it is a typical antivirus, 

121
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,020
 will not be able to see it. 

122
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,420
 We've done better things, things are safer from the start, 

123
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,040
 and this is good, our users are more protected, but not perfectly. 

124
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,420
 But this puts us in a complicated position as security professionals because 

125
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,920
 we have been working in this traditional environment for so long. 

126
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,760
 We want to install the same things as an antivirus on our device, and we want it to work in the same way. 

127
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:04,340
 but they can not, unfortunately. So we need to think differently about security on those devices. 

128
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,699
 I've mentioned this, but the input-output, how these devices are able to communicate 

129
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:20,200
 are our biggest problem. There are so many modes, they have so many communication chips, they use cellular network, they use Bluetooth 

130
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:28,480
 use Near-Field Communication. They have an SD card that you can take out, or put if you do not already come with one. 

131
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,360
 It also has the power cord. That is, 

132
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,740
 this can also happen in the world of traditional PCs, but 

133
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,400
 The problem with cables is that you also use them for data transfer. 

134
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,780
 So they are vulnerable to attacks via USB as it is what they use. 

135
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:54,319
 We have certainly seen, in the past, power cords used to attack cell phones. 

136
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:03,160
 And also, if you're like me, you're always with him connected to the computer. No need to put cables on the wall, they are always on my computer. 

137
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:09,520
 In fact, there was an "air gap" network, ie a network that has no access 

138
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,400
 the Internet. Government networks do this - keep the internet away, that's where things are scary. 

139
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:22,520
 There was no internet access. And an employee needed to connect his cell phone. 

140
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,620
 and plugged it into one of the computers within the air-gap network. 

141
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,620
 The cell phone had malware, and it attacked the computer to which it was connected. 

142
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,500
 And then was able to access the secure network 

143
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:49,240
 by means of the power cable. Then you can see charging stations at airports, where you pay a small amount and can charge your device. 

144
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,600
 They're a little scary. They are not necessarily always bad, but 

145
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,740
 could be. They can be made to attack your device. 

146
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:06,860
 When you have a physical connection to the device, you still need to have an exploit or vulnerability, but 

147
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,480
 is a little easier than hitting someone on the other side of the world. 

148
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,760
 But we have already seen vulnerabilities, such as BlueBorne, 

149
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:22,560
 we saw another vulnerability via Bluetooth last week, where device chips 

150
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,079
 vulnerable - users do not have to click on a link or download anything 

151
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,660
 do not need to open anything in the browser, 

152
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:39,920
 is just an attack with remote code execution, in which the user does not have to do anything. And they can be targets. 

153
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,979
 There is also GPS, you can know where people are. 

154
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,040
 For example, now would be a good time to steal my home there in the United States. 

155
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:59,660
 Well, to be honest it's possible to see through Facebook or Twitter, as I posted selfies with a lot of people today saying I was here. 

156
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,300
 So now would be a good time to break into my house. 

157
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,140
 but surely their devices observe them everywhere. 

158
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:15,840
 And anyone with access to your device is able to know where you are 

159
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,320
 or defraud your location by telling your GPS that you are somewhere else. 

160
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,660
 If you, for example, are charged with a crime and your cell phone says you were there even if you were not. 

161
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:35,000
 That's a little scary. We've also seen attacks on the SIM chips themselves, they actually run multiple applets, 

162
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,040
 we have seen vulnerabilities in them in the past as well. Then there are several possible ways to attack these devices. 

163
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,480
 But it always comes down to remote code execution, security failures prior to MS17 

164
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,520
 of the, now we call EternalBlue, is the improved, 

165
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,699
 the newest one, in which the user does not have to do anything. 

166
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:05,900
 There are vulnerabilities that are typically called "client-focused attacks," or sometimes "remote code execution." 

167
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,900
 now, because there are fewer remote code execution today 

168
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,620
 in which the user opens a document in a PDF reader 

169
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,640
 or open something in Google Maps or your browser 

170
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,840
 and the application is attacked by some vulnerability. 

171
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:31,360
 Or there are social engineering attacks, in which you try to convince someone to download malicious software, 

172
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,980
 vulnerabilities are not necessary if you persuade a person to download a malicious application on the device itself. 

173
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,420
 You do not have to look for an uncorrected vulnerability. 

174
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,880
 So there are several ways to attack these devices, but in general they are more of the same. 

175
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,800
 They are what we deal with in all these years of security, only bigger and bigger. 

176
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:04,319
 And that does not stop at a single device. For each mobile or Internet device of the Things you 

177
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,480
 includes in your corporate network, comes with a lot of other things 

178
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,079
 to worry about. Is not it just "Is the device up to date?", "Does it have any known vulnerabilities?", 

179
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:22,379
 But also, it has a cellular operator, and based on the SIM chip that it carries 

180
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:29,720
 the cellular network itself; it connects to different WiFi networks out there; 

181
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,740
 I do not know if your conferences are like the ones in the United States, but 

182
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,860
 WiFi networks of events are usually very hostile places 

183
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:47,379
 in the United States, a good way to have your device attacked is to use an event WiFi. You can be cooler than that, 

184
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,460
 but we certainly are not. 

185
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:56,880
 Certainly the device usually comes with an app store, so an Android or iOS comes with 

186
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,060
 the relevant app store, or may have third-party stores. Amazon has an app store, 

187
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,220
 this is a third party app store. 

188
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:13,440
 Now everyone wants to be friends with Amazon. So the traditional one is "Do not use a third party app store". 

189
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,200
 But see, even people like Amazon created an app store. 

190
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,520
 And there are also all the servers for email, 

191
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,100
 file storage, applications ... there are all those machines out there. 

192
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,699
 There must be a Linux machine somewhere in the cloud. 

193
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:39,240
 which we may be vulnerable to - we saw not so long ago, a vulnerability in OpenSSH arose. 

194
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:47,080
 And if people are deploying SSH using these machines, they should run something like OpenSSH 

195
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:54,139
 or people running this infrastructure - which, again, is not us, is not our secure corporate network 

196
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:02,000
 is someone else, one of the vendors involved - are they upgrading their systems? 

197
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,740
 We need to ask this, as each arriving device is talking to several of these systems. 

198
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,940
 Again: there may be security vulnerabilities, there may be victims of social engineering. 

199
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,240
 And it's totally out of our reach. 

200
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,140
 In safety, we like to be in control. We like to control the security of our organization. 

201
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,260
 But every time we allow one of these devices, we allow the unknown. 

202
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,120
 And it's not just on mobile devices - we can say the same about cloud computing, 

203
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:39,379
 of social media; all this allows a lot of strangers in your infrastructure. 

204
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:48,080
 I mentioned social engineering. Social engineering has the potential to be much larger than it is in mobility. 

205
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,100
 We have already seen this - I am seeing many text messages, SMS, 

206
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:01,199
 I see a lot of phishing via SMS. You can also receive emails on mobile devices. 

207
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,360
 But there's also in WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and the like; 

208
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,320
 social media - they also have messaging apps, direct messages, 

209
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,580
 ways to achieve it. 

210
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,679
 Any way a person has to get a link to open or to download 

211
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,040
 is a way to infect it with malware, it's a way to do it 

212
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,560
 open something that will exploit a vulnerability. 

213
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,639
 There are various ways of attacking people. There is a QR Code here in the center 

214
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,600
 - well, not in the center, but here on the side - and 

215
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,399
 I used this in one of my interactions, one of my clients 

216
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:52,280
 shared a building where there was a restaurant on the first floor. It was in the center of the city, so there are buildings with offices on the top 

217
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,060
 and something like a restaurant downstairs. 

218
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,800
 And we put a QR Code on a fake poster in the rest room 

219
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:13,639
 and said, "If you downloaded this app, the next time you go to this restaurant - where they probably went a long way, because it was convenient - you get a discount" 

220
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,240
 So they hoped to download an app from the restaurant, and they did. 

221
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,400
 When they read the QR Code, they downloaded the app. It was the real restaurant app. 

222
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:32,380
 Just had a little extra. You know, in that case it was malware for good. 

223
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,620
 It was a social engineering interaction to see if people would come down. 

224
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:42,439
 But bad guys would do the same with real malware. And there are several ways to attack people 

225
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,040
 and, in traditional security training programs, they focus primarily on e-mail. 

226
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:57,580
 We're doing fine, we have not solved the problem yet, but we're working to teach people not to click on suspicious email links. 

227
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:06,000
 But there are so many other ways to attack them, and we're not focusing on our security awareness programs at all. 

228
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,960
 And our users are also beginning to see that they need this awareness training. 

229
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,720
 So what is at stake? I believe I've already convinced you that there are vulnerabilities and ways of attacking people. 

230
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,760
 But there are people who say "So, it's someone else's device" 

231
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,980
 However, there are certainly corporate data on the device that can be stolen. 

232
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:38,000
 And even if it's not corporate data, employee information can be used to launch a future attack. 

233
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,700
 So information that is not related to a company can still be used in a potential attack and break into the network. 

234
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:55,240
 And also, controlling a device remotely - if I have malware, I can connect to a control server 

235
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,280
 that can do things like send emails to other people in the company 

236
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,240
 convincing them to download malicious applications. You can post to Twitter. 

237
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,420
 I do not know how much you know about our president in the United States, but he's proof that 

238
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,460
 no matter what you say on Twitter, it will be okay. 

239
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:22,040
 So maybe I should take this because I thought saying something ridiculous on Twitter could ruin your life, 

240
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,780
 but it is not always the case, because our president puts some weird things. 

241
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,440
 You can also record user videos. 

242
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,580
 Think about where your device comes with. Mine goes with me everywhere, so 

243
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,179
 connect the webcam to a computer: potentially bad. 

244
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:46,480
 Turn on the webcam from a cellphone and record, you'll probably catch someone in a compromising situation. 

245
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,880
 You can exit sandboxes. I mentioned that stable apps can not be seen on the same layer 

246
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,120
 but they can use privilege escalation in the same way we do in traditional devices 

247
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,979
 to exit the sandbox and gain access to additional information. 

248
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,880
 And my favorite now is the mobile attack by pivoting - these things like entering through WiFi, 

249
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,120
 like to use the cafeteria network or the corporate conference network, 

250
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,699
 networks that typically give them access to a bunch of other devices. 

251
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,660
 They speak TCP / IP. 

252
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:31,680
 From a compromised mobile device, you can attack other traditional devices on the same network. If they are on the same network, they are able to communicate 

253
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,540
 you can play things like EternalBlue. You can use Nmap, you can use N-Access, anything that 

254
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,820
 you can do in a compromised traditional machine. 

255
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:48,840
 You can also do it on a mobile device, that is, use that device to gain more access within the organization you are attacking. 

256
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,800
 So what to do? We have this problem and we need to solve it. 

257
00:24:52,800 --> 00:25:00,780
 What have we done before? We can not just put "mobile" together with "antivirus" and solve the problem as we have done in the past. 

258
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:08,440
 We need to think differently. So let's talk about what we did so far and, in my view, what we failed. 

259
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,200
 The first natural order of things was 

260
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:21,380
 "Well, let's have two cellphones, one just for work and one for personal use." 

261
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,240
 You still see people doing it, mostly in government in the United States, but generally not. 

262
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,840
 Sometimes we see devices with two profiles. 

263
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:39,000
 They tend to emerge, raise a lot of money with investors and disappear as fast as they came. 

264
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,160
 You know, having two profiles on one device, 

265
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:52,000
 sometimes they explode because they are trying to put two CPUs and two memory chips, 

266
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,860
 and it gets kind of big. Then you have that old cell phone - and no one likes it - or it gets too hot. 

267
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,840
 anyway, it typically does not work as well. 

268
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,419
 You know, Samsung Knox is still out there. They always want to call it "Black Phone", 

269
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,780
 but there are five different companies calling their cell phones "Black Phone" 

270
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,879
 What people typically do is "application isolation" 

271
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,620
 So they have two PDF readers, two email clients, 

272
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:28,320
 two of everything, then one of them will be corporate and the other will be personal. 

273
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,679
 And they get isolated - again, sandboxing. But while they are on the same memory chip, 

274
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:42,380
 they can be invaded. However, the "gold standard" we are using now 

275
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,960
 is the isolation of applications. 

276
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,560
 Then, the so-called mobile device management 

277
00:26:51,560 --> 00:27:01,460
 I think a lot comes from corporate greed, making people buy something that says they're going to keep them safe is very effective. 

278
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,520
 Because many people are not security experts, and even those who 

279
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,620
 is an expert in security, memory corruption vulnerabilities, or malware analysis, they really know that. 

280
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:18,320
 Or they are good at securing Windows networks. They may not necessarily be 

281
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,960
 security of iPhone, but become CISO of the company because they were promoted 

282
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,180
 and the sellers come and say, 

283
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:32,640
 "If you install this mobile device management on your network, all your mobile security issues are gone!" 

284
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,300
 That sounds cool, and people buy it. 

285
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,720
 However, they realize that their mobile devices continue to be attacked 

286
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,100
 successfully. Mobile device management is not doing much to prevent it. 

287
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,000
 Another part of the problem is that the management of mobile devices is acquired by Operations 

288
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,080
 E Operations always exceeds Security. Operations makes things happen, Safety spends money, 

289
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,000
 and if Security is going well, nothing happens, 

290
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,520
 which makes Security difficult to sell. You see, "we do things, we sell to people and that's how people get paid." 

291
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,600
 We do well. Security, we're not attacked ... now what? 

292
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:20,060
 Many people use mobile device management, but this is typically ... 

293
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:26,340
 this came because the BlackBerry BES, or BlackBerry Enterprise Server 

294
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,399
 was an item in people's budget. 

295
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:37,460
 Believe me, I find it as annoying as anyone. I like to read exploits and do malware analysis, these things, 

296
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:45,280
 but now I have a start-up. So I have to think about what people buy and why, which involves all corporate security, which 

297
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,600
 and at the end of the day, whether you're developing exploits or doing malware analysis, people paying your bills 

298
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,719
 who hire or buy these exploits, are people who are interested in corporate or government security. 

299
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,920
 So we need to think about this sort of thing. Again, I know this is annoying. 

300
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:11,180
 So, BlackBerry BES allowed people not to go to the IT department 

301
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:17,200
 and say "Here's my BlackBerry, install corporate email or any-thing-corporate" 

302
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,320
 And when people started having iPhones and Androids and taking them to the 

303
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,360
 company, people wanted the same thing, click something and 

304
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,740
 download a configuration profile and work magically. Think about it: download a configuration profile. 

305
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:41,540
 If you like social engineering, a light has come and you're right: this is a great way to use social engineering in someone. 

306
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:51,560
 Think that you know the IT department and "this is the profile that will allow them to access corporate email and we have updated so they can install the profile." 

307
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,720
 This is how you install malicious apps on your iPhone. 

308
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,240
 Because it does not run anything that is not signed by Apple, but you can sign with your company's certificate 

309
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,360
 and that's how malwares come. It's how jailbreaks work, too. 

310
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,659
 Typically it installs an application, and must be confirmed with "Yes" to install 

311
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,480
 and users say "Yes" if what they want is worth it. 

312
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,040
 Again, there are many mobile device management out there 

313
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,080
 but people began to refuse. Then the sellers changed the name 

314
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:35,419
 If "mobile device management" has a bad reputation, let's change the name and generate a new acronym 

315
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,060
 Enterprise Mobility Management. 

316
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:44,320
 What is essentially the same thing, with some extra security components 

317
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,960
 but most of the things that come with it are already available on the device itself, such as remote cleaning 

318
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,160
 or most APIs to manage the device. 

319
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,040
 They already come with the device. And many of them in fact are not so useful. 

320
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:08,180
 In fact they bring an enterprise app store, a VPN so you can manage these configuration profiles 

321
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:14,780
 It will offer that of the two apps, one for internal corporate use and one for personal use. 

322
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,280
 You can buy a piece or else it all; if you 

323
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:28,040
 works in some company, you probably something like your corporate app store, or have your VPN 

324
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:35,540
 all set up for you. Here's Citrix, but it's just an example, everyone has one. 

325
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:41,639
 BlackBerry basically disappeared as Android and Apple have emerged 

326
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:48,300
 and dominated the market. They had a solution before, which was good, 

327
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,580
 and one of the first mobile device management tools 

328
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,419
 and now they are selling their own Corporate Mobility Management. 

329
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:03,700
 They still sell devices, but not so many. They are more in the market of Corporate Mobility Management. 

330
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:12,920
 Mobile application management, that's the big point that people are worried about right now. This is the "gold standard" 

331
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,400
 which is managing applications. Keep corporate data isolated. 

332
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,680
 At the moment we accept that there will be vulnerabilities in devices. There will be 

333
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,700
 malicious applications that come with the device or are downloaded by the user. 

334
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:38,000
 But if we can keep our applications and corporate data safe, even in this hostile environment, then we're fine. 

335
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,140
 In my experience, this does not work as well because 

336
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:50,260
 for example, with the iPhone jailbreak, we get root access, which is basically the zero layer. 

337
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:57,220
 He can go under the sandboxes, see what's in them, extract memory, 

338
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:02,660
 there are different ways to attack, but in general it has not worked very well. 

339
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:08,440
 Again, if it is not very sophisticated, it can defend itself 

340
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,200
 but particularly when attackers pirate or buy such things. 

341
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,860
 For example, Microsoft Intune. People pirate or buy, 

342
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,240
 or take a trial version, make sure your exploits and payloads work against these things 

343
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,580
 and they will get the data they want. We always see attackers doing this, they will always have access to 

344
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:39,720
 preventive security measures, and ensure that they can pass through them. 

345
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:48,200
 Of course we return to our starting point. We start by saying that antivirus on mobile devices do not work, 

346
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,260
 we need to have some protection at the endpoint, we need to 

347
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,379
 be better than an antivirus that only scans itself. 

348
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:05,240
 However, we must have something on the device that is able to know if there are vulnerabilities in it 

349
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,159
 and warn him if he is under attack. 

350
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,480
 Know what applications are in it, create blacklists and white lists of applications - which does not work very well, 

351
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,639
 but it is what many people are doing now, such as Zimperium 

352
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,960
 and many actors in mobile application management have also begun to do so, 

353
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:30,540
 the new jargon is "defense against mobile threats", they need to create 

354
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,400
 a new magic quadrant for this. 

355
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:42,580
 And there are many new players in this market. However, we return to the same problem that we are unable to prevent everything. 

356
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,860
 Meanwhile, the bad guys are having access to these tools 

357
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:53,360
 and as they develop their payloads and attacks, they make sure they are able to pass through them. 

358
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,720
 This is always our problem on the defense side, the bad guys 

359
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:06,600
 they discover what we can detect and do a little different so that we can not detect. 

360
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:12,540
 I'm almost out of time, but: mobile threats revisited, there are a lot of them. 

361
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:18,320
 They remain in the same categories: we have remote code execution attacks, 

362
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,740
 but against a lot of different chips, not just the same, 

363
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:29,379
 it is not just port 445, there are several ways to attack these devices. 

364
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,700
 The phone operator through a malicious signal tower, attack via Bluetooth, 

365
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:39,799
 or something that may not be available to us, we have more applications, 

366
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,000
 we have more ways to phishing, 

367
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,400
 there are more applications on the client side, 

368
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:56,580
 we have more people taking them everywhere, with more ways of being attacked, 

369
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,000
 What I think is missing in all this is 

370
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,220
 back to "101 risk management", I am a career pentester, do invasion tests, I play the role of bad guys, 

371
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,279
 but pro, I'm looking for vulnerabilities and I help fix them. 

372
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,720
 But what I really think has been lacking since the beginning 

373
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,000
 with this mobile device thing ... I know it's a great way to make money, a lot of it falls into 

374
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,300
 "We want money more than we want things safe." 

375
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:30,320
 We put "mobile" together with security systems that worked very well on traditional Windows desktops. 

376
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,960
 However, we had no hope with an iPhone, or Android, or other mobile device. 

377
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,200
 We never really understood, and we got to the point of noticing that we need, 

378
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,379
 we never understand who attacked our servers, we never understand 

379
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:53,520
 the vulnerabilities out there, we never understood how people were attacked or how they fell in an attack. 

380
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,460
 So we never really monitor the risks, and I think that's what's missing. 

381
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:03,620
 in the mobile world, in the cloud world, in this whole world of "computing in the new generation." 

382
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,680
 In fact we only need something like Nessus and Metasploit 

383
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,140
 and things we've had for a long time on our traditional devices that we just do not use. 

384
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,900
 We just started implementing preventive security 

385
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,140
 and we never think about what prevention measures we really need in 

386
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:27,799
 our organization that are different from the consumer's need that uses a certain tool. 

387
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,080
 We may not need this because our corporate infrastructure is different. 

388
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:40,500
 So what we need to do in our companies is bring these devices 

389
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,940
 for our test programs. If you do tests to ensure that Windows is up to date 

390
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,080
 or if you make security aware that people are receiving phishing emails 

391
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,700
 periodically, you need to include mobile devices in those programs. 

392
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,220
 You need to know how up-to-date iPhones are. 

393
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:08,560
 Are they vulnerable to attack? I do not like to update my iPhone, as I need it to remain "jailbroken" so I can do app tests. 

394
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,040
 But the default user needs to be with the latest updates, same thing with 

395
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,200
 Android: Are your apps up to date? 

396
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,379
 Is there an application on the device that is known to be malicious? 

397
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:28,040
 Again, train them for social engineering attacks. If you do this by email 

398
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:34,080
 sending text messages, WhatsApp or Twitter is just one more step. 

399
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,880
 There are many different ways out there to attack them 

400
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:45,320
 and we've already done that, we're good at doing invasion testing and vulnerability analysis. 

401
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:51,300
 Or monitor the risks in the traditional infrastructures we control. 

402
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:59,020
 But we need to bring BYOD into that, not just ignore it. I still do many invasion tests 

403
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,140
 even if it does more product-related activities today. 

404
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:08,960
 But I still do it; consumers do not know what they want, we have to tell them, 

405
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,220
 if you are in the security team of your company, or if you work as a security tester, 

406
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,980
 Start talking about it, you know. 

407
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:25,540
 Mobile devices will not stop being attacked just because we do not test them. Attackers do not work that way. 

408
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,800
 And we need to do it more often than today. 

409
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,280
 We usually do safety testing once every three months, most likely once a year. 

410
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,760
 But mobile devices, Internet of Things and cloud change very fast. Typically you do not 

411
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,540
 buy a new computer or laptop, but you drop the cell phone on the private 

412
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:54,640
 or comes an Amazon Echo or another new device, and suddenly they're everywhere on your network. 

413
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,240
 So you need to do this often, because the network is changing very fast now. 

414
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,959
 So, this is just an example of a tool that does this, but 

415
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,100
 They're telling me to get off the stage now. 

416
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:15,180
 So this is an example of a tool such as a Metasploit or N-Access for mobility and IoT 

417
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,680
 is free, and hacks iPhones and Android. 

418
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,080
 Do phishing and the like, so ... I'll leave that to you before you start answering questions. 

419
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,400
 I think it's almost 11 years since the first iPhone was released, 

420
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,040
 then, if this is the beginning of mobility, 

421
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,320
 security has managed to achieve it? And my answer to that is "no." 

422
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:46,600
 We'll be able to make it happen, if we do safety tests and understand the risks we're fighting. 

423
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,360
 and create preventive measures that in fact 

424
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:58,080
 stop the attacks we're seeing, instead of just putting "mobile" next to something that worked at some point.
