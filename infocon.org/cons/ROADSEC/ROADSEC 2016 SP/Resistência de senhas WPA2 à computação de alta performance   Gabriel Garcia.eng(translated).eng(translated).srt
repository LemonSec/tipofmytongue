4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,720
guys I'm going to start here, so

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,850
first I think I'm going to give you two

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,800
computation bases that everyone has

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,470
to know to clearly understand the

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,869
results

9
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,910


10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,370
.  high performance and

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,210
complexity theory is more or less right I

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,820
passed with 80 right I did very well in

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,989
the class at night I did paraná

14
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,250
so I'm going to pass on these two things

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,559
that the guy will do for me opened

16
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:50,879
my mind to computing I ended up

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,530
discovering that he actually wants computing

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,690
later  that I learned this and it's

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,850
enough for you to understand well

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,160
what's weak what's strong what works

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,000
and what doesn't in cryptography is

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,970
how to present I'll skip it I'll talk

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,020
about high performance computing

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,640
first which I think is an

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,170
extremely topic  interesting also

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,390
relevant and that's what I do research

27
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,610
in the academic area

28
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,490
first I'll understand myself when you

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,060
program in python and sharp java

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,000
without  realizing that you are

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,590
programming for a processor with more

32
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,930
than one core will end up happening that

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,820
is in the figure on the left here you have

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,670
six cores, one core will be busy

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,950
and the other five will sit and

36
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,070
wait while you when you use it

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,530
is computing  parallel, you can use

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,570
all the cores efficiently,

39
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,670
so basically it will happen and this is going to happen

40
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,619
here, quoting cpu there, the guys just

41
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,950
wash it well, send the mortgage calculating

42
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,470
but in old age and then basically it's

43
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,899
not earning useless and dreamy

44
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,880
deutsche bank and then it starts to overheat.

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,500
give a lot of problems

46
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,680
until it's time for windows, get it

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,680
so bro parallel programming and you can

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,899
see that nowadays not even cell phones

49
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,780
will find a thing that

50
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,980
used to be

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,590
extremely arid but nowadays

52
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,420
you can't buy an intel if

53
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,739
I go  run I don't think there is anymore the

54
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,799
market advance to past missions

55
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,510
so high performance computing is

56
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,370
separated basically  nt in two aspects

57
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,680
parallel computing where you are

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,780
programming for several cores that

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,060
share the same main memory

60
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,000
ie you have eight amd 41 cores

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,670
intel colleague and all these cores

62
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,920
share the same memory that would be

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,349
your main memory your ddr3 of r4

64
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:46,799
it's your memory to store the

65
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,440
work data except relax and everything else

66
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,049
so basically they share this

67
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:54,540
memory is avoid distributed computing

68
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,160
where you'll take

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,720
parallel computing and you'll put it on several

70
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,069
different computers

71
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,720
and these various computers will

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,420
start working together  to solve a

73
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,440
single problem

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,269
so what we do here

75
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,370
is basically divide a problem into small parts

76
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,129
where each computer or each core will

77
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,440
solve this small part in the end I'll

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,390
put everything together to get a

79
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,940
bigger result give an example, for example, it's a

80
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,669
network of  10 thousand items 10 thousand

81
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,380
whole numbers who programs abandoned the

82
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,970
idea is great

83
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,000
the total sum of t  All 10 million items

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,840


85
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,190
I have ten cores so if I have

86
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,109
to get each item from the king to start

87
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:44,430
adding a variable we call

88
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,919
accumulator to accumulate this sum until

89
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,090
reaching the total sum,

90
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,440
I will need 10 million

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,790
interactions to arrive  by the end of the

92
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,910
race the sum total or I can use

93
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,370
my resources more intelligently what

94
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,489
I'm going to do is take it will split king into

95
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,010
several parts each part of a million and

96
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,950
I'm going to give those parts of a million each

97
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,720
different part to  the core each

98
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,379
core will do a million

99
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,419
parallel interactions all at the same time 10

100
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,209
cores working hardcore there all

101
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,449
this time when the cores run out i

102
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,190
'll take the sum of each and make a

103
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,510
sum 1 million for each core and 10 at the

104
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,789
end to get  each core the sum of

105
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:27,800
that total for each year

106
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,379
adding up to a single total so what i

107
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:34,789
was 9.99 times faster because the team

108
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,879
must come out at the end so

109
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,069
parallel computing is this distributed computing

110
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,840
when i t  I have ten cores in each

111
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,789
computer and there are ten computers so

112
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:45,169
I'm going to send 100,000 to each

113
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,870
computer and we're going to give a million to

114
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,520
each computer and this counter divides it

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,169
into 100,000 to each core and then you

116
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:53,539
start scaling it so that you

117
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:54,860
get to the level  that will be able

118
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,530
to add up to 10 million items with 100

119
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,460
operations.

120
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,080
I will show here that it is a

121
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,039
thing that exists and has because there is a

122
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,750
parallel discussion of shared memory video

123
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,449
and it is separated into two

124
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:09,830
strands of parents

125
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,620
the mind that is the  multi-instrumentalist

126
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,930
power I can have complete freedom under

127
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,060
the instructions I'm executing if they

128
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,860
are multiple functions and all the freedom

129
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,719
of the data I'm going to use are very

130
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:24,139
careful and there's the sind where I can

131
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,419
make only one instruction with several

132
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:27,949
data basically the biggest representative

133
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:32,000
sunday and cpu sind and gpu the

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,690
infamous video card is this

135
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,190
simplicity of being able to make a

136
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,080
single instruction in all the data gives me the

137
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,789
capacity  of making

138
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,029
very simple core processors this will undermine

139
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,710
the ability to put more cores in

140
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,580
less space

141
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,169
then I will show the discrepancy of a

142
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:52,669
cpu and gpu number of cores and how

143
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,430
the indium works I want to add if to the

144
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,129
network of ten thousand of my positions in

145
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,379
all cores vote adding is an

146
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:01,610
instruction only there won't be a core

147
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,229
adding others of betraying no dividing

148
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,270
there's no way everyone has to add

149
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,310
so when I want to increase the brightness

150
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,889
of an image I'll add each byte of the

151
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,870
image as much as I  I want half

152
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,449
brightness and the same operation and gpu is

153
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,389
extremely efficient with images and

154
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,060
everything else after it calls yours which is

155
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,139
actually nothing more than

156
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,779
a coprocessor which is a processor that

157
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,550
has a different architecture that

158
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,889
better exploits the type of application if

159
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,990
connects to the motherboard and starts a

160
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,029
computer processor starts using

161
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,529
this co-processor to

162
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:37,370
speed things up is like I said a

163
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,199
representative of minc cpu qu  and it

164
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,030
can be any instruction

165
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,730
with any data in progress a data in

166
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,220
space in time is usually it's

167
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,690
multiple cores each core is

168
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,130
extremely complex to have that kind

169
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,110
of nuclear freedom fast and efficient

170
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,440
so you have a cpu it has q 4ghz and

171
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,110
a normal cpu  nowadays a gpu has

172
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,940
1.3 ghz

173
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,840
so it has to work and

174
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,550
much lower frequencies because it's not

175
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,980
as complex as most and the same

176
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,220
show the difference of cores by the

177
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,490
power to tail slide here I didn't even see it

178
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,820
but this is an example  is

179
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,400
a motherboard of a scientific calculation server

180
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,410
and you can see here there are

181
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,180
four malls so if you put

182
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,920
four processors on the same motherboard

183
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,990
it splits on the same shared memory resource

184
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,220


185
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,770
then when you turn on linux it will

186
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,450
identify the four processors

187
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,700
added up without any problem

188
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,920
is this here is used a lot more than you

189
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,700
think

190
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,050
although I've never seen a bizarre thirty

191
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,810
so I want to use you car and

192
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,760
this one p  for example where eight

193
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,670
softwares and cooling at once only

194
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,520
using bronze tubes that reach

195
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,920
the end and they took refuge only the bronze that

196
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,970
manages to warn everyone at the same time

197
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,560
you can see that these green ones here are

198
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,030
memory banks

199
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,670
so this is not uncommon  that exists and a

200
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,280
lot of madness

201
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,950
now Venus indicates a club very

202
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,500
simplified and not simplified to

203
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,820
extreme so you have to get as

204
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,180
little as possible in the space started

205
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,940
so if you see Grantham's video card in

206
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,190
them much bigger with the square

207
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,340
cpu and put it close  actually

208
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,590
I also have a small square, the big one

209
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,450
you see is nothing more than the board that

210
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,600
incorporates this square and it also has

211
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,420
a large school refrigeration size

212
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,890
, so I had to choose

213
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,810
giant there a collegiate video card is

214
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,150
bigger than the square itself  so they

215
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,250
are very similar things but eto'o and

216
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,090
a gpu

217
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,990
the only architectural difference is internal and

218
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,140
for example the break of 80 which has

219
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,220
5 thousand cores

220
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,050
so no d  to compare with md is

221
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,090
much more profit

222
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,630
is a break of 80 costs 5 thousand dollars

223
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,250
nvidia usually has three aspects

224
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,889
to gtx are for gaming

225
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,019
the four are for the workstation and

226
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,399
the breaks in question for scientific computing

227
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,079


228
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,790
this is an example  people don't

229
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,259
care much about beauty there is no

230
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,759
video card that costs 5 thousand dollars to

231
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,769
do this for me it's my

232
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:08,449
video card shines and everything else how can you,

233
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:12,649
right and distributed computing is enough

234
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:15,559
to improve it even more.

235
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,149
uses isolated computer systems

236
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,439
more physically connected by a

237
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,419
bus some type of

238
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,419
communication interface so 11 is not on the same

239
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:25,489
motherboard it can't also be in the same place

240
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:27,079
can have both in a house and another in

241
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,970
another house but they are connected by

242
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,730
a cable either  internet for example they

243
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,089
can share resources and help each other

244
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:36,799
to achieve a

245
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,549


246
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,889


247
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:40,699


248
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,079
global calculation.  I can get the

249
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:44,059
motherboard I want to put another second bigger brand

250
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:44,959


251
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,639
I'm sorry it won't roll I have to

252
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,889
another motherboard from God and so and

253
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,559
putting and increasing scalar is very

254
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,079
difficult in which distributed computing

255
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:55,879
you buy a new computer put it in the

256
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:01,220
suite you already have  one more computer is and

257
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,480
is usually combined

258
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,669
parallel computing system with

259
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,649
distributed computing there is parallel in the beginning we

260
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,389
then have several computers with

261
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,129
multiple cores this computer with

262
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:11,569
multiple cores will run everything [ __ ]

263
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,779
and all computers will run

264
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,769
it together with that same

265
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,389
computer  that I showed you some

266
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,850
time ago that there were only eight who are in

267
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,879
this pile of computers the same,

268
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,499
so if you thought this computer, you

269
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:31,639
can imagine all together with the magnitude of

270
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,169
what a supercomputer is, which is

271
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,939
what the name we give these massive computers is

272
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:38,209
cool that this photo is just a

273
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:40,789
piece of an example of this type of data

274
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:41,569
center

275
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:44,899
so it's a lot and mu  It's computing power

276
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,709
and I'll talk in a moment

277
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,569
how do you have it

278
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:53,059
all for what was spent shine and lots of

279
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,350
money to maintain it

280
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,089
so you have an idea there is a site

281
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,709
called top500 it's a list of the greatest

282
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,139
supercomputers in the world china has

283
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,910
a very predominant position in first

284
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,499
and second place but the united states

285
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:06,499
is also very cool that it has 14

286
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,059
positions in the seven biggest

287
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:10,559
formerly united states dominated

288
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,689
china began to invest much more in

289
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:14,549
high performance computing as the

290
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,949
gains that the united states had already had

291
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:18,869
you can see that the largest in the world has 10

292
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,099
million cores

293
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:22,289
so it's something like that, it's a monstrous thing, it

294
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:24,929
's a gigantic market that

295
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,639
governments invest millions of millions of

296
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,239
to be able to show you why the most

297
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,369
interesting thing is that the

298
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:34,259
supercomputer is now in

299
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:36,239
third place.  of the top 500

300
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:39,569
he spends about a person that 9

301
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:42,709
million dollars a year in energy

302
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:46,949
so he spends a lot of energy a lot of energy

303
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:49,409
even at gale  ra invests annually

304
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:57,569
so that the globe to run

305
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,879
these tests is kind of depressing compared to

306
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,979
everything I've shown but they are the

307
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:03,779
main ones you must have heard about

308
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,639
him that there will be the draw. Everything else

309
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,959
computers are cool instruments

310
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,059
that I can simulate this

311
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,999
extremely distributed environment  massive in

312
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,699
much smaller proportions and much

313
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,479
cheaper so I got sumo is to simulate 48

314
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:21,869
cores using from the rest of the country spending

315
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,519
about three thousand reais the equivalent of

316
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,159
a conventional computer to run a

317
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,279
movie on low

318
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,409
so it's a really cool project and the 3,000

319
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:33,299
including  suite includes power cabling

320
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,609
but it's a really cool project

321
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:37,439
this one isn't mine because I'm not

322
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:38,999
crazy lego what's here must be more

323
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,819
expensive than the computer in brazil

324
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,369
so it's not a little uglier than this

325
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:47,549
is now every  part that so

326
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,409
much big so much of crazy computer but just

327
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:51,809
to run crysis at maximum will no it will

328
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,899
not this is a great example that

329
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,219
is very u  sing what we call

330
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:57,899
fluid dynamics you can

331
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,029
simulate exactly how a fluid, whether

332
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,819
it is air, how it behaves given an

333
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:04,889
interaction of another object, so here

334
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,329
basically I can know exactly

335
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,059
how my car's aerodynamics is without

336
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,709
even needing to know yours.  car

337
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,659
so even saving time of having

338
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,489
each part manufactured assemble until the chance

339
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,679
of getting it wrong and the chance of the guy to assemble it wrong

340
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,839
and I'll be able to simulate that in a

341
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,789
few minutes seconds depending on

342
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:22,889
your computational power

343
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,709
so it's pretty cool you can

344
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,420
also use it for rocket then you  can

345
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,699
predict exactly how your rocket

346
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:32,129
will react in the atmosphere how will

347
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,290
the heat release be so if you

348
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,639
can do simulations that will

349
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,679
save you time and money and that's basically

350
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,739
what governs humanity in the year

351
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,929
so that's extremely cool I  I

352
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,459
know for example a viscous liquid

353
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,350
this is a liquid I don't excuse myself I

354
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,749
don't know another word this is

355
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,609
another one  example that is protein interaction,

356
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:52,049
we can also call it

357
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,489
molecular dynamics

358
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:55,799
so I can know if a vaccine or

359
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,439
a virus, if the vaccine works against

360
00:13:58,439 --> 00:13:59,999
this virus or how this virus behaves

361
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,290


362
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,480
without being able to apply a human,

363
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,160
so I can know if the vaccine  it will

364
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,109
work without all that bureaucracy of

365
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:09,449
applying a monkey after a year

366
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,799
so I can know at the time

367
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,869
depending on the computational power

368
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:13,980
again that's why we have 10

369
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,779
million profits which is being able to know at the

370
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:16,699
time

371
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,509
so this is extremely interesting

372
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,639
there are several  projects for those who want to

373
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,220
help community projects to help

374
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,379
cancer researchers there from harvard

375
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,449
I'm not mistaken that the initiative and you

376
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,889
download a computer program

377
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:31,019
that whenever you're not using you donate

378
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,639
computer power on the internet that

379
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,269
basically this and if this project

380
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:38,850
you  adele he's going to send you a

381
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,829
giant piece of information i told you

382
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,410
take a million items from rit send him he

383
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,610
asks you to go  you calculate it will take

384
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,980
too long when you return it will have

385
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,809
saved a lot of time and maybe it will have

386
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,279
helped the cure of cancer

387
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,279
take a look there it is quite interesting

388
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,819
this type of project is some other

389
00:14:56,819 --> 00:15:00,059
applications that i can mention at the beginning

390
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,160
here for example it is almost only the

391
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,069
snow equations I've already wanted to simulate

392
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:08,009
computational fluid dynamics that

393
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:10,139
generally math will realize this

394
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,419
is math we solve a way

395
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,669
but we have to do a lot of little

396
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:15,600
transformations to solve

397
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,470
computationally with society I

398
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,209
'm not an animal of  seven heads

399
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,699
a big paraná pf it involves several

400
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,309
variables but are partial derivatives

401
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:28,230
some taken a little trigonometry

402
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,819
it's not complicated

403
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:31,910
but computationally although

404
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,809
computationally solve it here

405
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,239
dude you get yours and 7 it's going to take the

406
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:36,750
age

407
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,150
of the earth to calculate a

408
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,460
little bit  will have three seconds of molecular dynamics

409
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,840


410
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,130
so we have to use this tip  the

411
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,230
active computing one

412
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,280
I can cite other examples that are not

413
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,680
here but that will bid I don't know if

414
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,080
they have already succeeded is kind of a bit

415
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,940
speculative but I have from

416
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,910
extremely reliable sources that this

417
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,040
happens basically how does

418
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,290
the atomic bomb work

419
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,490
in russia  is coming not to be playing

420
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,230
atomic bomb for fun spend

421
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,310
money and uranium

422
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,470
so for him to follow the buffer on these

423
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,610
balls in the middle of nowhere

424
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,770
basically he both the bomb go a

425
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,510
mathematician guy and try to model

426
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,970
exactly how the bomb works ie

427
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,980
it had an explosion ray  such was

428
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,930
placed so much uranium so I'll

429
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,520
know how to optimize putting as

430
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,810
little uranium as possible to achieve the greatest

431
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,040
possible support

432
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,410
so I'll write a function that

433
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,260
describes how the ray

434
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,990
influences the radius and explosion

435
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,370
I'll be able to minimize  this radius

436
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,270
maximize this radius year it's math

437
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,910
and then man the idea is both a bomb be

438
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,680
the model when it got so good

439
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,839
lid another got better  the model is

440
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,780
getting very close to what I think it

441
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,910
is again discovered the old man then you go with the

442
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,920
wave and say let's stop nobody have

443
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,760
more

444
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,610


445
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,490


446
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,830
bombs  so you get to

447
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,109
know exactly how much

448
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,550
uranium you have to put in from a certain radius

449
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,260
blast if you get it exactly a

450
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,970
city nothing more

451
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,170
if you want to build an

452
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,839
enemy base and nothing else so man

453
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,449
after united states got it sansa form

454
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,550
they say go to russia to  everything

455
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,640
for the guys and they started to be

456
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,380
resulting that they still didn't have such a

457
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,490
shape on google of the biggest

458
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,260
nuclear bombs ever

459
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,180
launched russia has type ce of the biggest

460
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,820
farms has stopped a long time

461
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,290
continuing another example also

462
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,780
of high performance computing is

463
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,870
brute force  is trying to break your passwords

464
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,600
so he said that we use them I'll

465
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,220
explain why it doesn't work so well being

466
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,120
able to explain the complexity theory  ade

467
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,690
is special in complexity theory,

468
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,910
let's see that how many generations have

469
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,809
this dust,

470
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,450
how many times it is running, someone

471
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,340
screams at me and exactly removes it

472
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,429
so I'm going to run this fort and videos

473
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:10,230
that means this algorithm that

474
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,880
I'm here in the one that I published  on the screen and

475
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,500
doesn't do anything technically I don't imagine

476
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,390
that it does it has a

477
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,070
dn complexity order

478
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,740
that is when I want to calculate 10 thousand

479
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,580
items

480
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,740
because it is I want to paint on the screen all

481
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,390
the items when I have a network of

482
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,340
positions I'll paint 10 thousand  videos

483
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm going to perform the same action I must

484
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,240
perform this action

485
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,880
nvidia as the network of

486
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,790
money positions increases and if it

487
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,800
increases linearly every 10 thousand and 10

488
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,270
thousand 100 thousand and 100 thousand

489
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,630
beauty the difference if several applications

490
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,240
in our world  they behave very

491
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,650
differently

492
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,350
it can be 11 today, for example, there is

493
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,780
a hash there that is gabriel equal to

494
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,080
21 if I look for age property of the

495
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,850
champion I'll just put him to reign

496
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,980
position g  abriel 21 an instruction

497
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,860
solved in a mold of n2o must have already

498
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,200
seen that it is when you do a

499
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,390
business side search than luck but when you

500
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,970
do a search in the net it is already sorted you

501
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,490
will need to look for a lot less

502
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,370
addiction you will not need to pass nine  a

503
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,770
time to find out where the number

504
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,230
is basically i have the 10 thousand

505
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,610
positions i want to search for item number

506
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,920
5 it takes half of the king from what

507
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,720
is to the left

508
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,130
if the number was less than half

509
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:35,190
is on the left and it goes  now it starts

510
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,570
to get worse it has n times so dn has an n

511
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,250
which is the number of air and raises a

512
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,710
constant in a square in something silly and

513
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,440
in the fourth and you have an idea people don't even

514
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,960
differentiate much and if raised constant

515
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,260
because the nature of its high

516
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,809
something is already bad, it's already too much and the

517
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:00,510
worst thing is that when it is raised and it's not 5

518
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,429
raised to 10 thousand, for example, it has more than

519
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:03,580
10 thousand positions plus

520
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,220
read two high 10 thousand it's something like that

521
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,830
in another world it won't even be one  one of the

522
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,000
worst and just not you  m worse than the

523
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,370
factorial yen this guy, if you got here, it

524
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,350
's no use buying a computer on

525
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,150
earth that won't solve your

526
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,270
problem and there are several programs

527
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,950
that we can't

528
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,130
solve.

529
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,130
The

530
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,260
fourth program from Turin he said about

531
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,270
it is that the machine of everything and

532
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,070
not being able to solve it is a problem

533
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,710
that computing cannot solve and it's

534
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,720
a problem that basically says I

535
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,330
can't know if this program will stop

536
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,580
or it will  finish giving me an answer

537
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,800
and that's why when some program

538
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,960
from paulo, his windows operating system

539
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,240
doesn't know if this program will stop or

540
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,010
not and then he says old people and wants to close the

541
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,380
wait for windows he can't

542
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,820
decide for himself he doesn't  that

543
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,770
5, the program will talk, so I'll be

544
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,940
there, it can't be

545
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,430
constitutionally impossible.

546
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,860
Tomorrow, a program has not decided to know if

547
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,000
the program will stop or not, and in the theory

548
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,370
of  complexity of management the problems

549
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,650
can be named more than the programs p

550
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,050
that only these problems here,

551
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,850
just these problems, it's on blog nnn where

552
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,100
these problems are colonial ie

553
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,090
you can solve it

554
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,280
I'll solve more or less good and

555
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,410
the nominal ones could not  and this total

556
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,270
cannot be called a problem that is extremely

557
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,800
difficult to solve,

558
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,660
they are very difficult and we usually

559
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,650
throw it high

560
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,960


561
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,180


562
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,010
to be

563
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,790
worse

564
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,950
understood and the big question of

565
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,080
computing a question that everyone

566
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,820
raises that has articles and articles

567
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,260
articles about it with the song nobody

568
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,090
answers until today is if there really is

569
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,680
this division if really these

570
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,800
problems that are complete np are mp no

571
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,720
there is no solution that was also the

572
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,510
best for them because no one

573
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,390
could prove that it isn't

574
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,610
then whoever can prove that pnpb

575
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,870
is practically in their computation

576
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,410
can do

577
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,750
anything now nobody

578
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,700
has done it until today there are problems are

579
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,150
too difficult illegal that this is only valid

580
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,500
for classic paintings are

581
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,150
quantum computing I'll just talk about it for

582
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,030
a moment here it can invert

583
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:36,400
this table and for example rsa

584
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,620
that encryption algorithm

585
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,630
public key and everything else that protects the

586
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,570
certificates that protects most of

587
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,610
your communication from the keys themselves

588
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,840
so this problem you break it falls into

589
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,270
this order of complexity

590
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,670
this here is the constant this

591
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,040
is what is raising it's still

592
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,230
basically the  which is to be elevated to an,

593
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,060
that is, the problem increases here

594
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,370
to be a genius lobby solves it makes

595
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,010
no difference in the end it is a

596
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,450
constant and lead to eni which is what I

597
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,980
showed is one of the worst of the worst in terms

598
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,640
of complexity that there is.  it's an

599
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,110
extremely difficult problem to

600
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,379
solve

601
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,500
the big problem is that this small one

602
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,770
starts to get easy that's why

603
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,080
I wanted to talk about  1024 bits that died

604
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,520
in 2010

605
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,500
it doesn't work anymore to stuff

606
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,210
because with the computational power

607
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,830
we have nowadays we

608
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,100
can't protect communication because

609
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,870
encryption intrinsically depends

610
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,000
on what I can encrypt very

611
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,700
easy I can photograph very easily

612
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,550
ie the  complexities spelling trivial

613
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,060
but it's rafah's not knowing the key it's a

614
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,830
sinister stuff you have to do some

615
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,370
tricky math or tricky enough that

616
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,140
there isn't the computational power on

617
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,480
earth that humans know to

618
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,610
solve this kind of problem because it's

619
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,670
a problem  and not the name of the problem

620
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,620
cannot be described by a polygon which is

621
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,360
the elevation of the mean squared

622
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,680
but it is a problem that is not normal

623
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,420
we do not know an efficient method to

624
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,070
solve this it is

625
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,560
no use doubling the number of

626
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,870
cores because I am  doubling an

627
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,850
order the community is going to be much bigger

628
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,640
because it is elevated by n increase a

629
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,080
little

630
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,049
human error rising too high  the

631
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,039
complexity

632
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,950
then is a problem that we

633
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,240
can't sleep yet and cryptography

634
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,149
it depends exactly on that if

635
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,260
someday someone arrives with the magic supercomputer it

636
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,870
sends all our security it's already gone

637
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,760
because brazil intrinsically depends,

638
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,600
says I said it's this

639
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,000
complexity of democracy then  it's the

640
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,730
dnk blog is one of the easiest ones after

641
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:03,120
a very good past now in brute force

642
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,510


643
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,740
maybe the key almost impossible to talk

644
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,090
a little about the benchmarks

645
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,409
now everyone understood dude that

646
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,370
photography depends on

647
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,980
computational power understand cryptography

648
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,889
it if someday someone invents  a

649
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,389
non-classical architecture which is what

650
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:20,610
we say is basically our

651
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,889
security will want to beat what

652
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,830
happens with confusing this one where

653
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,059
I was going to talk about computing cutting the

654
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:31,200
risk groups I was just lucky

655
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,059
in 2013 more or less

656
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,419
basically it was  quantum computing

657
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,580
it manages to change the orders

658
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,070
complexity of algorithms basically

659
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,840
from terrorism that I solve with  rd of

660
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,220
complexity x a computer a

661
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,559
plastic computer in the computer cut

662
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,639
that it will have another order of

663
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:49,169
complexity because it is solved in

664
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:51,779
a very different way

665
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,309
the big problem if you manage to

666
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:55,110
implement a quantum algorithm that

667
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,059
solve the problem is a business that

668
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,289
we do not exist  none have the code

669
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,000
to test yet but extremely

670
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,250
difficult man as if we were

671
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,740
doing science in the human century 5 thousand

672
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,240
years ago there was paper there was no

673
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,460
science in addition there was social network if you

674
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,110
publish an article it's something that's the

675
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,029
fastest goal of computing  Quantum

676
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,059
is extremely backwards in science

677
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:16,679
so this guy managed to make an

678
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,049
algorithm that solves the invoicing problem,

679
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:21,809
which is this one of complexity,

680
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,330
so it's a continuous rhythm that solves the

681
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,190
same thing as breaking a

682
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,039
communication without the key, but it fell to

683
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,010
order dna lobby  complexity

684
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,380
so the guy is possible now it

685
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,630
's basically possible to break the only

686
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,010
thing we  don't have it yet, it's a

687
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,929
quantum computer that runs

688
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:43,080
this with precision and efficiency

689
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,820
on the day we already have it,

690
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,860
the power of communication can't be used anymore

691
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,779
because you can put a

692
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,360
30,000-bit key and there's an

693
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,980
availability that won't increase much  and a

694
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,409
log of 30 thousand will increase little

695
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:56,610
by little,

696
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,100
understand so this algorithm is very

697
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,870
cool if you can look for it when

698
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,279
the algorithm was launched.

699
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,899


700
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:05,460


701
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,559


702
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,389
science is the case

703
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:11,159
so much that nowadays there are already several

704
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,200
initiatives from another sector the fia asks

705
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,909
for lippi who has several photographs of the

706
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:21,830
best cup and public key

707
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,809
including a quantum cryptography technique

708
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,200
that everything i'm going to take turns on the

709
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,059
cut that apply this  so

710
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,610
cryptography that uses a merchant line

711
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,179
can go up much better finds that's

712
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:37,919
basically it dear

713
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,539
quantum computing is coming if we

714
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,350
be able to start saying that you got the np

715
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,240
in quantum computing bro we are

716
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,960
very wrong

717
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:58,250
yet we are not there now make

718
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,639
very similar complexity difference 22

719
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,480
high the rech size of your

720
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,059
case

721
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:15,029
is 256 bits 56 quick here so

722
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:16,799
you can get a sense of  how much the

723
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,179
disease was 56 to say count on your fingers

724
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,759
but it's not one with 77 years ago

725
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:29,429
so it's a guy over 1000 meters

726
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:34,710
so you can't solve a

727
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,899
problem yeah I'll show you some calculations

728
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,340
that show how long it would take to

729
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,649
break like this  he does it using the

730
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,090
knowledge that we have nowadays

731
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,519
in humanity

732
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,309
just to have a reference this is the

733
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,899
work of a witness a graphic from

734
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:51,870
past research where the marketing of

735
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,629
cracking wifi passwords in 2 111 years

736
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:57,210
each with 12 cores that  there are a total of

737
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:57,980
24

738
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,990
lucas it is possible to run crysis of a

739
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,470
good boxer and i'll put it as a reference

740
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,190
here

741
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,350
another reference i took is this

742
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,150
supercomputer there is a lot, it's in the

743
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,400
whole world it doesn't  in idea is to use the same

744
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,750
day 11 is 5 26 27 and this time it has 2400

745
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,070
cores in total

746
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,890
is I'll get an idea of how a

747
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,799
computer of this magnitude will try to

748
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,970
crack the password how long will it

749
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,190
take be a very powerful computer and

750
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,030
40 in  core is no small thing is to do

751
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,650
a

752
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,950
simple math we know that there are 6,400 processors

753
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,540
that each have six video cores

754
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,990
total there are 6400 processors is a lot

755
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,010


756
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:45,950


757
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,570


758
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,880
of

759
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,870
seconds

760
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,540
are 10 gigs without the second is one without is

761
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,490
for more than metro

762
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,850
but the big problem is that there was

763
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,190
a collision with almost certainty of an

764
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,880
action mill caused on the street 2 number of

765
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,690
possibilities

766
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,220
I can't say that in my father it's

767
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,340
too good  a lot is starts here ends up I

768
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,140
wanted to understand in staten break you

769
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,260
so the number is a lot of possibility of

770
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,419
two highs of 55 because I also

771
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:19,370
try to be very naughty so instead of 2

772
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,190
256 and talk bro is  it's just looking for a

773
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,020
business, the chance found in the middle of the

774
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,910
path is very high so we

775
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,919
consider that in half it will find

776
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,150
whether it is divided by 2 to 2 285 which is

777
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,970
basically the same thing, it changes almost

778
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,570
nothing and we will only take this here  of

779
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,200
years

780
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,220
to calculate the number of years, which is

781
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,900
ethical, I can't say the number of years

782
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,429
that we will take to be able to

783
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:48,380
calculate it is to be able to cause a collision

784
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,520
in this type of crack

785
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,490
using a supercomputer thinking,

786
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,040
or why this happens because of the

787
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,650
order of  complexity debating a streak

788
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,540
of causing a collision of figuring out a

789
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,260
password

790
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,780
there's a complexity to be taken even

791
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,929
though it's 2 high still isn't constant

792
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:07,970
so dude no matter how much

793
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,250
cores you need to dedicate or

794
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,900
increase from 256

795
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,330
512 for example is the most common  is doubling

796
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,340
out of 56 for someone who is two points

797
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,560
on what is 2 raised to 512 expensive

798
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,300
154 years I probably can't paint

799
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,530
on canvas

800
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:28,670
understand so we can

801
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,320
get an expensive idea that  and we have a

802
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,010
protection that calls nature, having

803
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,390
naturally we have the problems

804
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,220
that are extremely complex to

805
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,940
solve the economy calls, but

806
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,320
while even the human being knows that's

807
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,400
what happens,

808
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,740
understand, so we're in good faith a

809
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,060
computer like that will  having to double the

810
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,030
investment for you to double a

811
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,550
remaining one before increasing a bit only

812
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,340
one animal goes from 2002 and taken 55 2 to

813
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,510
the 56 mark

814
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,810
so the effort to double a

815
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:06,350
much smaller old guy is an unfair fight

816
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,970
or computing

817
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,620
is why  that the program works

818
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,340
basically man I'm going to open to

819
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,140
questions now I sent a lot of

820
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,550
knowledge I think it will contribute a

821
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,400
lot for you to understand what the team

822
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,530
in Brazil that computing what it

823
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,330
tries to solve any

824
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,850
computer support we call  of hpc

825
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,500
performance computing agents will be

826
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,550
able to know how to answer several

827
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,800
questions now about old photography

828
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,510
that will be able to help your career

829
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,570
know if a not  Fake science or not knowing

830
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,760
the guy what happens in the world thinks that

831
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,310
there bro extremely important

832
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,600
I asked the question how does anyone

833
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,620

basically what computing does in the

836
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,980
world which is simulations to help
