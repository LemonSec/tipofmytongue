[Music]

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:22,070
so thank you again roadside for having

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:26,619
me again I guess I didn't screw up too

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:30,800
bad last time because I was reinvented

7
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:32,630
again I apologize I don't speak

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,450
Portuguese but I didn't know some of the

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:43,489
things were saying about me anyway said

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:47,440
this is sorry I was pregnant tone down

11
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:51,320
the New York accent this topic is

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:55,309
obviously titled mistakes for me and to

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,309
talk about out of my experiences in all

14
00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:02,358
the time that I've worked security what

15
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:09,200
I found really works to make a healthy

16
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:12,320
security you were redundant and security

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,229
as a security person

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:28,419
running a security program and then also

19
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:28,420
what doesn't yeah so this is the

20
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:35,630
obligatory slide about why you might be

21
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,240
interested what I have to say about this

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,600
subject area I've been working in

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,390
security for about 15 or 16 years at

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,179
this point I've kind of stopped keeping

25
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,930
track but I've worked on a lot of

26
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:54,440
different security spaces and a lot of

27
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,270
different industries so when I first

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,149
started that I was actually working for

29
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:04,310
the US military that will try to keep

30
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:07,280
American politics out of this - a

31
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,759
wonderful research finding bogeys for

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,180
the government essentially then I sort

33
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,480
of pivoted into the financial space

34
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:20,480
first kind of bridging the gap between

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,570
the US government and finance by working

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,359
for I don't know how many people here

37
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:32,269
are familiar with the Federal Reserve

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,910
Bank but it's sort of the organization

39
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:39,460
that surprises

40
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:41,500
probably not go into the toilet doing a

41
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,500
lot of application security a lot of

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,880
advisory a lot of you know letting

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,420
people know the best way to do things to

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,960
make sure that our economy is being

45
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,570
destroyed by bad people after that I

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,340
decided I wanted to make some point make

47
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,760
some money

48
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:07,870
if that's in earth so I worked for first

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:12,579
Nasdaq which is one of the main stock

50
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:15,550
exchanges in the US and they also have

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,700
stock exchanges in other parts of the

52
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,980
country as well again I do an

53
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,179
application security but I was also the

54
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:27,730
lead of the security program there so I

55
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:33,250
was doing a lot of running around

56
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:35,230
telling people you know we don't want

57
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,500
the stock exchange to crash how can you

58
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:42,429
prevent that to happen a brief while I

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,290
worked for a actually bank event trading

60
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,280
house Anita do you have a Citibank in

61
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:50,709
Brazil yo they're everywhere you can't

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,440
avoid them mostly making sure that their

63
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,590
ATMs on such are getting broken into but

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,989
again

65
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:02,599
of guidance in terms of looking at how

66
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,910
they were building things figuring out

67
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:11,929
what were the best recommendations in

68
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:15,620
terms of you know you can't be running a

69
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,449
really really old version of a they

70
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,030
didn't have a luminescent soul there but

71
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:24,669
please don't run a really old version of

72
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:33,888
iOS on your systems so on and so forth

73
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:36,260
and then all the sudden that kind of

74
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,960
money shift gears and that's kind of how

75
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,620
I landed in sort of the start of SP

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,169
space I will so I found a seed bank I

77
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,930
started working for tumblr I apologize

78
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:51,440
it's not my fault they took the adult

79
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,020
content of the tumblr okay that happened

80
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,440
a long time after I left that I know who

81
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,630
you in that decision so I'm just gonna

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,940
lay that out there whether Tom where I

83
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,889
was more of the security engineer like

84
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,310
handsome new keyboard writing the code

85
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:09,560
to one of the big things we did was made

86
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,220
sure that every single part of toddler

87
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,650
was being served overage yes or to kill

88
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:23,460
us she protects the user environment too

89
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:26,289
users a waddle stuff since tumblr is a

90
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,859
platform that's been consumed not just

91
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,630
the US over the world you can imagine if

92
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,370
you're in a country that maybe looks

93
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:43,449
down on female perspective nipples I

94
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:46,930
don't they people could have their

95
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:49,180
privacy invaded and so it wonder one of

96
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,580
the big things we did was get so a

97
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,580
tumblr where this year - it's basically

98
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:58,050
like okay here's you know all over the

99
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:02,820
deck sort of looking at pictures of tags

100
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,820
pictures of I don't know

101
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,448
cool videos and whatnot but that other

102
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,549
one has it with her own private sites

103
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:16,930
and the dashboard is protected against

104
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,449
was served over an encrypted

105
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,060
communication of people's private sites

106
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:25,240
if he went to a Laurie accountant or

107
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:28,660
calm it wasn't and so I learned a big

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,030
initiative there to make sure that every

109
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,800
single aspect of tumblr was being served

110
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,799
over no severe silence

111
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:41,359
after that I decided shift tracks a

112
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:44,059
little bit I just went to work for a

113
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:46,068
start-up but it was compliant and

114
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:52,039
healthy whatever health is a company

115
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:55,279
that tries to aggregate and consume and

116
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:59,808
provide people who wanted to research on

117
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,699
cancer with a lot of data that people

118
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:03,919
would may not be able to get access to

119
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:07,399
so they're taking information from

120
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,279
doctors about but say what okay I did

121
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,649
this sort of treatment I gave them this

122
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,009
kind of drugs I gave them this kind of

123
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:17,539
authority I do these types of surgeries

124
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:19,839
here's what's worked here

125
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:23,269
what didn't here's information

126
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:26,569
development what these people do in

127
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:28,729
terms of okay did they have any

128
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:30,439
pre-existing health conditions that

129
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:34,568
might have contributed to their problems

130
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:39,139
I just can't imagine that's a very very

131
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:43,729
set up data to need to protect cancer is

132
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:45,649
a very sensitive thing you don't want

133
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,599
that one fall into the wrong hands

134
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:53,110
because people are not going to have a

135
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,110
lot of confidence in you if you're

136
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:59,799
letting the world know my gosh this

137
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:03,270
person has leukemia or

138
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:06,039
breast cancer

139
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,840
and this actually monetize mathletes a

140
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,580
Citibank and as that are the financial

141
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,190
stuff is that there's a lot of

142
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,950
regulatory stuff that also ties it to

143
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:18,460
this not just sort of the ethical or the

144
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:20,979
moral implication we should protect this

145
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,650
data because people are trusting us with

146
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:29,580
it or you know we have a responsibility

147
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:32,500
to do so but also if we violate a law

148
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,539
that tells us that we have to protect

149
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,429
things in a certain way that could

150
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,880
actually thank throughout a smaller

151
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:41,380
company or you don't want to be in the

152
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,090
terms of the financial company you don't

153
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:47,380
want to be our page of The Wall Street

154
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:49,150
Journal because somebody forgot

155
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,870
something close report on the firewall

156
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,310
or you know has simple injection or

157
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,420
what's not just talking about the

158
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:00,310
classic yet so that I didn't do

159
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,130
something that I guess it's a little bit

160
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,560
more in line with tumblr but I went to

161
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,660
work for Spotify and I guess the reason

162
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,250
that I have this leg is also the fact

163
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,360
that I want to highlight the fact that

164
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:16,150
there are a lot of different red balls

165
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,980
risks associated risks and things that

166
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,990
you need to be worried about and all of

167
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:25,589
these organizations since father

168
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:29,709
how many people here in Spotify everyone

169
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:32,380
you know Brazil is actually one of our

170
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:35,050
most enthusiastic what I found of

171
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:42,490
consumers and that's awesome thank you

172
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:46,569
for isn't my stock prices but you can

173
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:48,580
make that looking at Citibank as the Fed

174
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,740
that the military at you and say okay

175
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,040
security is really scary if there's a

176
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,940
breach there right you know you could

177
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,099
screw the economy would screw up the way

178
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,370
people make money in case of the

179
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:07,750
military you could put people who are

180
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:10,570
fighting a war at risk with Spotify

181
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:14,350
people might not think you might be like

182
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,790
oh what's the big deal but there's a lot

183
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,010
of different people we need to protect

184
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,329
can you imagine how embarrassing it

185
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,819
would be and I'm not going to do one

186
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:25,000
particular artist but think about your

187
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,980
favorite artist that's and imagine how

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,750
embarrassing it would be for that and if

189
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,390
they're alcohol that was like super

190
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,870
hyped of the playing everyone's waiting

191
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:38,709
for it got these or if somebody broke

192
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:42,220
into their accounts and uploaded a track

193
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:44,859
that was super offensive and had just

194
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,500
completely made them look bad or maybe

195
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,930
somebody changes their album icon to a

196
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,510
picture of somebody's but I don't know

197
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,000
like people are not going to want to be

198
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:58,480
an artist like the Spotify platform if

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,150
we don't make them confident that they

200
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,760
can trust us with the stuff that they

201
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:06,459
want to keep secret the other side of it

202
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,220
is the consumer and this is true for a

203
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,380
lot of and I'm just using the places

204
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,920
that I worked at is work that has

205
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,730
specific examples but this is true of a

206
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,579
lot of places

207
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,430
why would I do Spotify if I feel like

208
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,650
somebody is going to be constantly you

209
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,729
know hacked into my account I have to

210
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,120
reset my password

211
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:30,100
there actually is you can imagine a lot

212
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:35,790
of people want stuff for free premium

213
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:39,170
accounts are really really attractive

214
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,929
things that people want

215
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,299
okay that I forget what the price of

216
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:46,029
that is sorry that my favorite email for

217
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:49,519
free but people don't want to leave that

218
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:53,209
2015 20 whenever his dollars there's

219
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,829
actually a black market who are getting

220
00:11:53,209 --> 00:12:00,679
these multi premium accounts and

221
00:11:54,829 --> 00:12:03,410
reselling them so and that's just

222
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:06,829
looking at the risks to the users and

223
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,449
there is it's typically sumers we'll

224
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:11,748
talk a little bit more about some of the

225
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:13,969
other threats but I guess the point that

226
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:16,100
I wanted to make with the slide is I've

227
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,679
been in all of these different scenarios

228
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,589
where there's a lot of things to worry

229
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:26,988
about and I've noticed tracks I've

230
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:28,669
noticed I think a lot of the question

231
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:31,790
that comes on and if you're a big

232
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:34,220
follower of InfoSec Twitter you probably

233
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,108
see this as well as people are still

234
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,279
scratching their heads that wondering

235
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:45,439
why take security more seriously why

236
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:51,410
aren't people what what are we doing

237
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:52,790
wrong to make security something that

238
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,019
people don't want to participate in

239
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,920
something that people don't want to

240
00:12:54,019 --> 00:13:01,950
interact with and that's why

241
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,670
I'm going to give four examples of where

242
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:07,140
I've seen a common thread of how people

243
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,770
in different organizations and how

244
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:14,189
people I should say organizations labor

245
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:16,890
security programs do things that make

246
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:21,720
people not receptive technology that the

247
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:23,730
new security efficiently the mistake

248
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,560
number one and actually this is this is

249
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,630
a really great timing for this

250
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,479
particular slide because I saw yesterday

251
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:32,850
that somebody did a poll like I don't

252
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,030
know if it was RSA or some other

253
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,950
security conference where somebody puts

254
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:41,839
an article that said that people who

255
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:44,850
were security people were more

256
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,550
comfortable walking into a bathroom a

257
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:53,940
public bathroom with no socks or shoes

258
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:55,319
on than using public Wi-Fi and you can

259
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,970
understand the reaction to that right

260
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,760
it's like you're a security practitioner

261
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:02,430
area you're not comfortable using public

262
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,689
Wi-Fi like you don't know any use a VPN

263
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,050
and install patches

264
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,600
we lock down your stuff but the security

265
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:14,459
culture of paranoia is a really big

266
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,870
thing I don't know in Brazil you have

267
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,790
there's there's two kind of things that

268
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:22,450
we use in America what is the the

269
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:24,969
Chicken Little the sky is falling and a

270
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,860
thing or the boy that cried wolf but

271
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,870
would you make everything an emergency

272
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,500
and when you would make everything seem

273
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,780
like holy crap everything's on fire you

274
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:39,600
need to react to this right away people

275
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,600
get overwhelmed people kind of feel like

276
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,060
almost desensitized to the fact that you

277
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,930
know the things that you're raising are

278
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,229
report

279
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,390
so really and we'll get you how to

280
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,070
overcome that stuff but the culture of

281
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,260
paranoia where everything is an

282
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,420
emergency that means nothing somewhere

283
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,700
in the state I'm sure that there are

284
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,800
some people in this room how have been

285
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,750
in buildings where the fire alarm is

286
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,550
possibly going off as they're testing it

287
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,320
and you're like it's probably another

288
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:13,560
fire drill but when there's actually a

289
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,560
fire okay-

290
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:19,600
don't

291
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,880
but snake number two that I see a sort

292
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,200
of visible hospitality I don't know if

293
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,750
anybody's actually watched this movie

294
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:30,519
I've never watched it but you know but

295
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:34,720
everyone wants a sequel right like

296
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:37,089
there's this attitude of you know we're

297
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,459
all really proud of being a hacker is

298
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:43,600
cool it's awesome like you can find like

299
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:45,729
manipulate the system and maybe do

300
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:53,699
things that you don't want to do but

301
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:56,079
this mentality of one the gotcha you

302
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,510
doesn't make people like you it doesn't

303
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,630
really make people receptive to to what

304
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,360
you want them to to make them want to

305
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:09,370
cooperate with you the other thing is

306
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,750
that when you walk in the room they

307
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,029
should look at you as somebody who wants

308
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,480
to help not somebody who is going to be

309
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:18,510
elevated and now that's a lot of a lot

310
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,760
of times I see that sort of perspective

311
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:26,050
with security picture and a lot of

312
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,089
organizations where you come in who like

313
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:31,900
oh god Security's here I'm in trouble

314
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:33,790
I'm stressed out I don't like it again

315
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,040
people want to cooperate with you it's

316
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,930
not learning to make people listen to

317
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,240
you and to ever make people want to come

318
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,239
to you if they need hope for something

319
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,120
the mistake number three and this is

320
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,040
sort of two-tiered is lack of

321
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,990
transparency I think of a lot of

322
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
organizations a lot of security

323
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,480
companies people don't really know what

324
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,520
security actually does it's sort of

325
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,550
almost like a black box where they say

326
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,589
hey I hope this thing you look at it

327
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:09,099
come back with you have a with a list of

328
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,740
stuff to fix you don't really know why

329
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:14,800
that you don't really know what these

330
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:22,180
sort of rationality is behind that the

331
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:24,940
other thing is sort of how do I engage

332
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,910
with security when should I be agent

333
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:31,060
security what's what biggest food

334
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:34,720
security offer me so that I can make my

335
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,270
stuff better a lot of times witness oh

336
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,910
yeah we're security give us a request

337
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,430
we'll review it will tell you if it's

338
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:47,770
good or if it's bad and sent you on your

339
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:49,480
way I think this is a really big one and

340
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:53,170
this is one of the things that I think

341
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,640
makes people avoidance for participating

342
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,710
if they see it as something that holds

343
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,240
them back it's easy said that they see

344
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,880
it as something that takes them more

345
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,700
time and that kind of ties me to the

346
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,880
previous slide where okay I gave you a

347
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:10,300
review you say these things are bad but

348
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,850
I go back and fix them I send it to you

349
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,680
again you go back to tell me some other

350
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:18,399
things are bad you don't really

351
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,600
understand you're basically especially

352
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,480
if they're working in a rapid paced

353
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,189
environment something that you thought

354
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,770
would take you two weeks maybe takes a

355
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,780
month now nobody likes that it's going

356
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,660
to make you frustrated and also you're

357
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,870
basically kind of being like hey your

358
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,180
baby's ugly alright or like even a new

359
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:40,549
onesie and I put a bow on it second

360
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,549
[Music]

361
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:47,140
security should not be pulling back your

362
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,530
organization from doing stuff because if

363
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,990
it is that people are probably just

364
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:57,040
going to try to work around you there's

365
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:59,700
this average it's better to ask for

366
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,010
forgiveness than ask for permission

367
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:08,490
security is seen as a problem that a lot

368
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:11,429
of times this is what occurs so what are

369
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,380
some ways to get around these things

370
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:15,480
that maybe people will not want to deal

371
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,299
with us what makes people think that

372
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,529
security is either a bunch of jerks or

373
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:28,230
holding us back or just something that

374
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:30,389
they don't even comprehend the first one

375
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,960
in this pysics of the culture of

376
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:38,820
paranoia is being honest about what

377
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:43,049
people should be scared about and the

378
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:45,149
weight of that scared regularly I went

379
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,179
down the street today I didn't pass

380
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:50,939
because I wanted to buy a company I

381
00:19:48,179 --> 00:20:01,049
probably announce that wrong so I use

382
00:19:50,940 --> 00:20:04,919
the company ETM a lot of but the reward

383
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:08,519
for me from these of the public ATM was

384
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,679
higher than the rest of getting my debit

385
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:14,750
card

386
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,750
skinny's whatever

387
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,700
understand that if people under together

388
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,770
threats that they know how to behave

389
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,480
properly to them they know how to

390
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,670
respond better and they're not

391
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,010
constantly scared they're not like in

392
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,410
this constant state of I want to know

393
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:37,540
what to do I don't know how to move they

394
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:41,050
can actually action on what's nevel okay

395
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:44,409
maybe you risk this versus worth reward

396
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:48,600
in the situation or maybe the threat is

397
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,600
really really bad and I can't do this

398
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,600
this is sort of this is the one I'm kind

399
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,639
of a screwball bulk out there be

400
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,040
somebody that they can look to that ask

401
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,340
questions do don't be someone who's just

402
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,530
going around in like no sorry you're

403
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,750
done what the heck why are you doing it

404
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,389
like that are you serious you're not

405
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,910
using unauthorized queries what the heck

406
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,790
is wrong with you be a friend someone

407
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:21,100
that if they don't know the answer it's

408
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:23,559
okay for you to ask be someone who when

409
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,990
you're working on reviewing whatever

410
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:28,540
they are working on you can basically

411
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:31,179
sit down with them and say hey tell me

412
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:33,760
why you decided to do it that way rather

413
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,970
than being like why did you do it that

414
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,970
way

415
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,830
also just have everything documented

416
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,500
like if you have at other places we

417
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,870
either have the confluence page or wiki

418
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,660
I know a lot of people are you saying so

419
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,120
posted stack overflows have places where

420
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,820
people can actually look up stuff and

421
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,790
understand you know like to take action

422
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,100
for themselves I mean we're not the only

423
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,570
people who like to sit down and figure

424
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,909
things out for themselves like that

425
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:13,500
wonderful filters a lot of Architects

426
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:16,990
have the same sort of mentality if you

427
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:20,110
instead of feeding like going to mom or

428
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:24,280
dad and I have a cookie mom and dad go

429
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:26,560
to the park if they can look and see oh

430
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,420
ok that's a good way to do things

431
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,760
I'll do that they're gonna feel more

432
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,790
empowered they're not going to feel the

433
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,390
air glued or scared or anxious things

434
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:40,710
that come after them to get yell at them

435
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:45,930
because they'll have some sort of

436
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:49,210
self-control and some sort of again

437
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:51,630
education and empowerment so that they

438
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,630
can say

439
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,649
here's the thing that told me to do it

440
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,979
this way that's why I get this way this

441
00:22:57,649 --> 00:23:03,738
also saves us a lot of time 2 or 6

442
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:05,359
o'clock we need a lot of time but it

443
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:07,909
also like this is great for us as

444
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,519
security because you just you don't get

445
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:15,200
people well nobody told me not to do it

446
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:21,100
that way so great they say well yeah we

447
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,100
did right there when we put both of us

448
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,420
the other thing and this kind of ties

449
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,910
back into these that last shot slide is

450
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,530
if you can yield out of your security

451
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,170
program so that people can take

452
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,180
ownership over their own security then

453
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:40,600
that makes things it's going to one see

454
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,040
a lot of work as security but it's also

455
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,409
going to be making them feel like

456
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,060
Security's not evolved that and what do

457
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,440
I mean by that well there's a lot of

458
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,300
different things you can do and it's not

459
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,730
just have a good documentation

460
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,740
how about different source code scanners

461
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:57,070
that can find you know hanging from

462
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,140
funner abilities so that they when they

463
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:02,800
actually to ask you to do a book review

464
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,540
you're not finding a bunch of really

465
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,129
easy to pick stuff but you're finding

466
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:13,930
the more serious more permanent problems

467
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:21,490
maybe have aways in their configurations

468
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:24,310
and AWS GCP whatever using even bare

469
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:28,720
metal will say hey I notice that you

470
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:32,399
haven't updated for what particular

471
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:37,650
third-party plug-in or you have

472
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,650
configured your server properly or maybe

473
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:48,320
to outer and say hey I notice that there

474
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:51,770
was a problem is this okay let's see us

475
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,049
work and it makes them feel like they're

476
00:24:51,770 --> 00:25:01,720
just asked me to you for every little

477
00:24:54,049 --> 00:25:04,549
thing it makes it more of a not

478
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:13,070
securities here and there here and there

479
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:15,220
like it's more like an equal

480
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,220
relationship

481
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,529
so I think they have like five minutes

482
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:27,080
left but so I kind of breezed through

483
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:29,269
this the one thing that I wanted to also

484
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,399
say is that there is never going to be

485
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:33,529
one size fits all approach the security

486
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:34,850
depending on where you work depending on

487
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:37,850
that things you need to be worried about

488
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,980
you may need to be a little bit more

489
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,549
strict or any sometimes you could be a

490
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,460
little bit more flexible if you are

491
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:49,639
subject to think display sarbanes-oxley

492
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,259
GCP HIPPA and yet they're really going

493
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:53,330
to have to put your foot down because

494
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:59,570
that means that the ball is going to

495
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:01,309
come after you or it's soon or you're

496
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,559
just have every bad news in the press

497
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:07,399
and nobody wants to have to deal with

498
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:09,519
that so again you know your mileage may

499
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,518
vary

500
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,869
getting there needs to be to adapt to

501
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:16,970
your organization's working style where

502
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:19,220
I work now it's very rapid if there's a

503
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:22,580
culture that allows people to feel

504
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:25,190
quickly and then recover quickly places

505
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,439
where it's a stock exchange or event

506
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,529
it's probably not going to work you

507
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,140
really need to find a ways kind of

508
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:35,350
implement the fun

509
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:42,150
tools of let's play make security a

510
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:42,149
hoping organization and the organization

511
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,020
within the parameters of what's going to

512
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,629
be well received within your

513
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:55,090
organization's culture and the way they

514
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:58,059
do things and this is sort of repetitive

515
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:01,480
but security is better you see when you

516
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:03,549
present yourself as hey I want to help

517
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,650
you learn I want to help you learn how

518
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:07,720
to make things better I want to make it

519
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,970
so that when you quote something about

520
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,100
coming back to you or when it when you

521
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,140
move out of a server or deploy a

522
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,570
firewall I come back to you and I'm

523
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,429
constantly telling you things to fix I

524
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,320
want you to have the knowledge in your

525
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:24,190
brain so that you can get a break from

526
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,780
to start I think I love the most is when

527
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,000
I sit down with a developer and showed

528
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:32,430
them how to exploit the vulnerability

529
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:38,670
and they're like wait this makes sense

530
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:42,030
oh I have a hacker now like our mascot

531
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:44,730
would take away just don't get her like

532
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:47,100
I get that feeling all the time when

533
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,870
when I pack into something I just keep

534
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,419
it to myself like there's been times

535
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:54,179
when I pop servers at companies I've

536
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,050
worked for and I'm like II lose a big

537
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,210
man on campus

538
00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:02,040
whoo oh but keep that suit yourself

539
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,410
don't be a jerk don't grow but people's

540
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,000
mistakes in their nose and it doesn't

541
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,130
work for cats it doesn't work for dogs

542
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,350
make crap on your rug it doesn't work

543
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,890
for developers or engineers or

544
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,889
architects

545
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,700
[Applause]

546
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:21,760
