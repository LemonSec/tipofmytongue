7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:01:10,170
so I'd like to start by thinking with

8
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:14,209
you about an issue now cybersecurity is

9
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,670
a service and when you go to the surface

10
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:25,319
what do you want to see you want to see

11
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:28,789
the attractions who are the attractions

12
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:33,660
of cybersecurity

13
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:35,759
we are the speakers that you saw today

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,470
is because that you see and other

15
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:45,209
conferences such as lack that those park

16
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:49,470
attractions this my brother friend burns

17
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:53,220
up on stage in Las Vegas in a room a

18
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:57,979
little bit larger than this one making

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:01,380
an ATM machine speed hundred dollars and

20
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:04,350
that's an attraction that's an

21
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,880
attraction of course

22
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:12,980
we'll be surprised no ATM will appear

23
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,269
dollar bills Las Vegas two thieves

24
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:24,750
Barnaby unfortunately is not anymore

25
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:29,070
left us this is Charlie Chris hacking

26
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:32,040
into an FCAT 2015 they picked up a

27
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:35,160
journalist and introvert sucking into

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,450
that Jeep and drove him up the road from

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,520
Raymond the funny thing about that is

30
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,530
not find that time increase market

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,190
leaders of the best thinkers in the

32
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,260
world the funny thing about that is the

33
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,400
fact that some colleagues at University

34
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:57,959
of California San Diego in 2010 had

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,239
already done it their respect is fellows

36
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,450
sitting Andy Greenberg in a current

37
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,730
relative of the road they just fooled us

38
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:10,100
at I Triple E security and privacy in an

39
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,100
academic conference nobody cared so

40
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:18,929
doing this type of attraction is type of

41
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:21,110
as recompensed and Cox else in raising

42
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,110
awareness

43
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,700
during a very unsafe thing sitting in

44
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:35,400
front of a robot that we were packing

45
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:38,179
into now these humans were harmed in

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,540
doing this experiment I promise

47
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:46,560
now when we presented this research as

48
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:51,180
we will see the research was widely

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:55,350
misunderstood and this is a theme the

50
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:59,880
theme is that our conferences including

51
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:03,030
this one including African rockers if we

52
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,370
go to Sao Paulo including blackhat

53
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,440
defconn packing the box all those

54
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:13,890
conferences rimworld attack research

55
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:19,440
reward attracted why because we are

56
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:21,810
hockety pockety I always smile whether

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,090
separately on the news in the security

58
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:28,340
industry say that they are former

59
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:32,849
partner for a report well I am a hacker

60
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:38,789
not reformed and not repenting and I

61
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:40,830
train hackers so these conferences

62
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,710
reward the fact research because we

63
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:49,650
appreciate the facts they are beautiful

64
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,260
have start to us the same thing that

65
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:56,159
beautiful mathematical demonstration is

66
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,260
a photographer or a physicist they

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,660
demonstrate

68
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:03,860
and they are beautiful like a forward

69
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:05,390
but we are not the same would living in

70
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,700
the same world where we were living

71
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:14,930
before our expecting the days resounded

72
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:20,000
on IRC tax today and double the current

73
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,540
page of New York Times it's a different

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,090
world

75
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:28,310
our has today impact the public

76
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:30,619
perception some examples a believe me

77
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,800
all of these examples were taken because

78
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,930
they are very good researchers I'm not

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,450
criticizing the research I'm using that

80
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:43,820
to the most great improvement in how the

81
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:47,240
research is understood by them the first

82
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:50,810
research is research by hundred costed

83
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,780
garcinia trap he picked up a protocol

84
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,700
called ats-v which is used in the next

85
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,679
generation air traffic control and to

86
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,930
talk about it for hours but maybe that's

87
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,670
not the point about any demonstrated

88
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,330
that the protocol had some weaknesses

89
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:11,240
now those witnesses were actually design

90
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,969
witnesses the protocol was designed like

91
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,200
that because in the way it was supposed

92
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:25,750
to be used them those weaknesses do not

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:27,390
count so this research was way less

94
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,990
dangerous

95
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:41,130
unless explosive that it turned out to

96
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:46,130
be on the media air you cannot complain

97
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,130
on the air no matter how hard you try

98
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:54,810
you potential did a research on aircraft

99
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:58,440
actually what you did was actually very

100
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,900
interesting he went on today any board a

101
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,230
flight management system flight

102
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:16,320
management system is the device that

103
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:18,960
controls basically so if we have this

104
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,270
control unit then show that it had a

105
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,880
buffer overflow it could exploit the

106
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:30,450
event you know explain some of the

107
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:31,790
possible of the possible outcomes what

108
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,849
he said was true

109
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:38,730
but it would not affect a plane flying

110
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,250
precisely for the same reasons that a

111
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:43,710
full team flight management system would

112
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,680
not effectively apply if the flight the

113
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,799
flight management system for any reason

114
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,490
goes out of service your plane is not

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,300
endangered there's redundancy built into

116
00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:00,390
the system say what his research was the

117
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,520
bank but not the research itself the

118
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:08,219
fact that it was presented on the media

119
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:11,010
using a news item by that in store was a

120
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:15,150
great job which is great I work with all

121
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,700
its course is great factors uses an

122
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:21,570
Android to remotely attack American

123
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:25,050
airplane which was not correct he had

124
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:27,750
used the metric phone to show aircraft

125
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,270
tracking of the whole by looking at the

126
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:34,740
atheist traffic data it was not a part

127
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:37,169
of the attack but when we do

128
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,970
demonstrations we should remember that

129
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:44,880
this is out this is the person

130
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:49,530
he heard that wanted to hijack aircraft

131
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,689
using a smartphone so the public

132
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,209
perception that map that comes out of

133
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,430
this is this is the one that we need

134
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,770
discontent is very very old

135
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:03,680
you can see that folder because there's

136
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:07,530
a stick in this laptop so it's at least

137
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,500
and here it is say he not read it

138
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,660
because of the beaver but I say say

139
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,210
Windows as the fact if you are but

140
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,510
Airbus a320 do you want to run out to

141
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,280
configuration if that never happens yeah

142
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:24,720
did you - they smell the same

143
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:32,060
functionality but obviously this is not

144
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,060
what is actually happening in this so

145
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:37,400
Cypress take your musical security

146
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:41,520
stories get treated like that

147
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:45,620
well for one cyber-physical system

148
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:49,680
subsystem and see we computer

149
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,320
enthusiasts nerds we forget that for

150
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,020
many people what happens with computers

151
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,080
is already something this period if it

152
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:02,460
goes one way or another most people

153
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,830
cannot tell what the difference so our

154
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,490
beautiful buffer overflow exploit and

155
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:10,860
open up calc the excellently most people

156
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,410
are like yeah

157
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,160
they don't understand why that's

158
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:20,939
important what happened but if you have

159
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:24,689
to say a robot as you did in the robot

160
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,570
moves they're like woo this changes

161
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:30,720
things

162
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:33,930
and cyber-physical systems are actually

163
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,850
very relative our society depends on

164
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,800
them

165
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,930
electrical power freezing air

166
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:45,750
conditioning every one of these systems

167
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:47,969
depends on computers largest bowl and if

168
00:10:45,750 --> 00:11:03,930
these systems are kicking down our

169
00:10:47,970 --> 00:11:07,200
society suffers into an ATM and people

170
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,300
will not really realize that what what's

171
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,740
bad about it until you make it speak

172
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:16,949
hundred dollars be on the floor right

173
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:19,740
into a self-driving car and people

174
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,560
immediately realize oh my god I'm going

175
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,290
to be sitting into that car that car is

176
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,599
no steering wheel and a brake is the

177
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:32,510
computer is acting too I'm going to be

178
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,510
later people realize that

179
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,060
these are industrial robots and these

180
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,800
Rovers

181
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,219
probably seen them at least once in your

182
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,560
lifetime are deployed what is called a

183
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:53,980
protected space there is this huge

184
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:58,790
around and if you open the caricature

185
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:01,400
the robot stops it's an electrical

186
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,860
switch like the red big button that you

187
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,530
can push to stop things it's an

188
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,290
electrical switch power this cap and

189
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:13,569
brakes are activated the robot stops

190
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,569
whatever the computer is saying

191
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:37,130
the robots are spot regardless of what

192
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:41,980
computers robot is called the movie

193
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,980
it's a beautiful robot it's designed

194
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:51,689
supposed to work alongside so you don't

195
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:54,319
want it to look like look like this and

196
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:58,770
uni is designed to be very safe

197
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,720
if you meet touches you it shouldn't but

198
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,430
if it touches you because a mistake work

199
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,850
that happened or because of accident

200
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,969
happened it immediately starts without

201
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,910
the thing called proprioception which is

202
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:15,990
which means that basically it constantly

203
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:17,730
confuse if the arm the joint is at the

204
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,760
same position that it should be act

205
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:23,279
given the amount of power it was apply

206
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,800
if it's different it stops because

207
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,140
they're serving is resisting it could be

208
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,020
an obstacle or it could be a human it's

209
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:34,490
immediately start so if you work

210
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:39,540
alongside human you we cannot harm you

211
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:42,779
it's impossible provided that the

212
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,770
software works correctly and the

213
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:47,630
software is designed but what did some

214
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:53,579
hacks

215
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:57,330
so people to test the security of unit

216
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:01,400
is way more important than being able to

217
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:06,900
test the security of this older brother

218
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:12,230
it's very important because you will not

219
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:12,230
because of software and you want

220
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:27,450
scissors are automated more an order and

221
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:30,270
calculation provokes fear so the there's

222
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:33,000
a mix-up of older and younger actors in

223
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:39,180
this crowd let's see how many people

224
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,170
have seen this film this is sparta this

225
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,939
is war games

226
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:46,920
it's 1984 and for many of us like my

227
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,500
generation of actors this was a very

228
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:54,360
important thing because it was the first

229
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:57,750
film that showed a half a guy happy to

230
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,920
computers for most of us that click whoo

231
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,920
I want to do that

232
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,100
I'm doing that and my government is

233
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,089
paying me to teach people to do that how

234
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,870
cool is that

235
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:16,769
I like five years old we could never

236
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,769
have imagined

237
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:24,399
so this film starts to the heart and I'm

238
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,279
going to spoiler it for you because it's

239
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,939
not the truth so you have no legitimate

240
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:36,519
claim to not having seen it but the

241
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:41,560
theme of the film is not happy the field

242
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:44,410
of the film is clear about donation in

243
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,319
the film control of the weapon is

244
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,079
transferred what AI is this what a lady

245
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:57,459
I would like invite me for filmmakers

246
00:15:50,079 --> 00:16:00,160
minds and that causes fear an AI

247
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:04,520
controlling automatically weapons that

248
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,939
causes fear well

249
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,520
controls American workers right now me

250
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,910
the 1984 artificial intelligence was not

251
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:21,380
that bad

252
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:24,380
but fear of automation is impermanence

253
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:27,500
white port an airplane if you have fear

254
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:32,750
of fly what you feel is we have a

255
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:37,670
philosophy control you cannot happen to

256
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:40,070
you and so you experience fear fear of

257
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,170
control in fear automation are very much

258
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:49,399
the same thing humans fear things that

259
00:16:42,170 --> 00:17:01,880
they cannot control so if we want people

260
00:16:49,399 --> 00:17:08,720
to use a physical system we need to

261
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:12,470
think in raising the discussion raising

262
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,400
awareness as I said look at running

263
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,030
cracks

264
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:23,480
they read them you have an experiment

265
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:38,480
but they need the public in very

266
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:43,460
important specific specific this is a

267
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,410
piece of denote by them here in the US

268
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,400
if you have one on one of you like to

269
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:52,420
spend for training watch this video from

270
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:57,620
YouTube it's one of the best

271
00:17:52,420 --> 00:18:03,620
cybersecurity presentations ever and one

272
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:08,239
of the point in it is to vulnerability

273
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:13,070
does variability research matter what we

274
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,080
don't know if sooner abilities are spots

275
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,590
if there's just a few there are many

276
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:28,409
business systems then

277
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:30,750
it improves space it's much trouble than

278
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,820
it's worth and ever and we don't know

279
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,400
that they are dates or sparse but

280
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,439
everything we see makes us weak the

281
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,780
reality is there is a lot of other

282
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,920
Americans so killing them one by one is

283
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:47,030
not a physical we should do it when we

284
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,079
find out in their evolution close it but

285
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,079
[Music]

286
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:58,680
this is us Albert is one of the best

287
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:03,720
care doctors of the world agree with

288
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:06,390
Brad Spangler author of gr security one

289
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,860
of the best defensive clear democracy so

290
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,870
offense and defense agreeing on

291
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,030
something isn't that isn't that weird

292
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,120
now because they are seeing the sneak

293
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:17,550
program for two different directions

294
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,229
what is their back soon squishing

295
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,029
problems one at a time

296
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,769
what is the

297
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:27,659
design and package their objectives

298
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:48,149
we've known that in software for a very

299
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:52,259
long time and so because we are at a

300
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:54,208
very delicate point in time systems are

301
00:19:52,259 --> 00:20:00,569
becoming more and more out - they didn't

302
00:19:54,209 --> 00:20:04,529
or network pervasive people do not trust

303
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:08,639
those systems and they are very rightly

304
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:10,559
not doing self if you think about that

305
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:13,258
think about your personal experience

306
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,459
with family and friends family and

307
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:24,289
friends expect computers not to work

308
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:24,289
think about they expect it is broken oh

309
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,859
it's not

310
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:36,679
but it's very different if you are

311
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,890
looking at it and it goes to purge

312
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,960
you're going to drive your car that's

313
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,500
very that's a moment where you don't

314
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:49,730
want to look at that territory move

315
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:51,980
let's see if today it works so we need

316
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,890
to restore confidence in the publican

317
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,450
dark elixir that we are actually an

318
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,929
engineering profession that we make

319
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,990
things that work reliably and we are not

320
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:09,040
like wizards making spells that

321
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:11,450
sometimes working sometimes birds so

322
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:16,178
because otherwise I'd be out there

323
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,179
standing and be rich but I

324
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:35,299
appropriate even faculty search on

325
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:37,239
robots first one significant privacy in

326
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:41,529
minute

327
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:45,499
now this is what the surface of order of

328
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:48,619
cybersecurity professionals shield we

329
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:50,749
found the back of recess all of the

330
00:21:48,619 --> 00:22:02,109
components of this rogue target robot

331
00:21:50,749 --> 00:22:02,109
which is a robot the Alpha without any

332
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:27,980
software updates by an FTP they don't do

333
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:34,960
to one of the computers to download this

334
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:37,789
entity so water how does that happen

335
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,830
when happens because when the computers

336
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,470
hooked with them when you turn on the

337
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:45,439
robot for the first five minutes the

338
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,840
access control is disabled just think

339
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,480
about it somebody told her that the

340
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,749
reasonable way to update himself was

341
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,850
affecting everyone and everybody access

342
00:22:53,749 --> 00:23:00,249
every part of the robot without the user

343
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,248
in the password for the first place

344
00:23:21,080 --> 00:24:57,149
even in actually we found that he

345
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,789
couldn't then out of a robot because

346
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:02,580
robots are very all the pieces of

347
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:05,850
software at the very very old pieces of

348
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,678
software that will never be secure what

349
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,320
you can do and what you should do is

350
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,500
design architectures of the robot so

351
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,590
that he makes an attack there correct

352
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,480
that even when an attacker takes control

353
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,779
of the robot because that's going to

354
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,039
happen they cannot achieve their

355
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:28,200
objectives what I'm their objective in

356
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,779
harmony human destroy the product

357
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,549
destroying the robot if you can avoid

358
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,110
the attacker being able to do these

359
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:38,590
three things

360
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:42,299
Computers all the time they want you

361
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:46,510
don't care you don't care

362
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:48,429
we are Packers we are used at defending

363
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:53,799
computers but defending a cyber physical

364
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:55,330
systems is is irrelevant what is

365
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,629
relevant is that the system does not

366
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:01,210
kill anyone or does not destroy anything

367
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:05,730
that's what's relevant if we were able

368
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,730
to do that who cares about computers

369
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:13,480
second suggestion since we want to

370
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:17,080
denied those goals we need to do that

371
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:32,679
why the product is being designed let me

372
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:36,809
show you now when I found out they had

373
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:39,639
to react right they are too young and

374
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:42,309
this was not known yet there's been a

375
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:46,479
number of attacks all these arms are

376
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:48,460
actually always the same heart if you

377
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,620
look at all the automotive security

378
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,560
attack missions all these contacts about

379
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,850
our movie

380
00:26:51,560 --> 00:27:02,340
from the geyser that broke into Tesla -

381
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:05,159
charlie crist everyone is the same there

382
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,709
are a number of issues of control units

383
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,250
that are connected to the outside you

384
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:14,190
break into one of these and from there

385
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:18,330
you are the automotive network that is

386
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:21,180
designed the predicated on one security

387
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:25,889
principle if you are inside the car

388
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:28,920
that's your car that's our car security

389
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:32,490
works if you are sitting inside the car

390
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:36,480
that's your car if you are inside the

391
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:39,210
cars record that's your car so once it

392
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,700
broken into the back leg everything can

393
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:45,120
happen you can delicious reduce a

394
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:47,250
hundred times we have a couple of cars

395
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,699
that were useful testing part and our

396
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,950
parking lot and every time we put a

397
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:58,280
student working dispersed we break some

398
00:27:52,950 --> 00:28:02,190
new that's not surprising we can do this

399
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:06,210
all over and read sometimes it's not

400
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:09,870
it's not doesn't matter what language is

401
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:13,880
that when you do this the cybersecurity

402
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:19,560
industry response so this is response

403
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:26,160
they sent every single owner of that

404
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:28,290
regime 11 we invite Wesley say stick

405
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:33,600
this us between to your dashboard and

406
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:37,470
let the carrot they deserve now this is

407
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:41,949
awesome because we basically train their

408
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:46,200
customers to slam into the car whatever

409
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:50,289
if I am able and let the car take itself

410
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,990
in his cars were three self-driving you

411
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:55,720
would already have somebody drinking out

412
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,899
of this type of recall notices we've a

413
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:21,419
program to add the car drive itself to

414
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:24,209
the parking lot and it would work but

415
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:33,460
anytime you have a particular

416
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:38,350
relationship with but the point is when

417
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:43,570
we deploy cars or robots or pacemakers

418
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:49,689
we cannot expect them to be updated we

419
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:52,000
need to be able you don't want this

420
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:55,269
equation will happen with medical

421
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,870
devices so you have a choice

422
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:57,870
you can

423
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:07,380
or we brand itself up data and run a

424
00:30:05,429 --> 00:31:13,290
risk that the software breaks your

425
00:30:07,380 --> 00:31:21,090
pacemaker or insulin now because when we

426
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:23,909
change because that's never going to

427
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:32,220
happen it's a good practical solution

428
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:36,690
it's even proposal or oh here's my you

429
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:39,480
can put it into your network and if you

430
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:48,929
stop the attacks commodity well let me

431
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:53,280
tell you one thing in 2006 they don't

432
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:54,690
work and they will never work and the

433
00:31:53,280 --> 00:32:03,629
reason why that will never work

434
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:06,059
is truthful the first reason is nobody

435
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:12,809
there same mind puts them in line in

436
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:16,710
front of a critical system so between

437
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:19,830
the brain and the braking points of the

438
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:25,500
car because when you hit the brake I

439
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:27,480
damn well want the car to break I don't

440
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,150
want any poison prevention system say oh

441
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:36,919
that's all let's block this signal for a

442
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:36,919
moment while I think about it

443
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:44,519
you run another issue if the intrusion

444
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:50,789
detection system that we build is very

445
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:54,029
well trading the card network what

446
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:57,599
should it do make a light blink on the

447
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:59,639
dashboard we've like a chromatic line

448
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:04,129
that report so that you know that your

449
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:06,869
car is being active people oil light

450
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:10,199
engine light hacker light on the

451
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:12,928
dashboard and what are you supposed to

452
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,009
do at that point to just drive over and

453
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:20,070
stop the car

454
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:20,809
thank you mate what do you do all the

455
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:40,470
research

456
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:44,039
hundreds of people watching so how do we

457
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:48,119
do this when we can only do one thing we

458
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:54,299
can pick up what we have the buggy TCU's

459
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:58,129
that behavior the buggy can kick out all

460
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:58,129
of the intrusion detection systems and

461
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:11,029
the risks to a car and that simple I

462
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:14,970
can't see the network network network

463
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:18,059
the risks to a car are a get stolen we

464
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:21,629
kill someone we don't world or outside

465
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:24,319
the car see personal information from

466
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:29,399
the car away those are the three races

467
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:33,779
you can write in a factory for those

468
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:36,808
lists and it is going to be complete an

469
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:38,899
attractor will need to do those actions

470
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:42,629
in order project those rules

471
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:44,969
this is cannot be on a larger corporate

472
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:46,710
network it's too complicated we will

473
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:49,649
always end up factories but they are too

474
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:51,659
complicated but for the for a cyber

475
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:53,549
physical systems they are now because

476
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:57,770
like a physical systems are dedicated

477
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,770
they do not do everything

478
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:14,350
typologies

479
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:16,750
action item we can't do that we can't

480
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:20,170
keep the issues that are connected to

481
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:22,560
the outside separated from the network

482
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:26,730
that is actually connected to the brakes

483
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:32,770
by the love of God I hope that we do

484
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:35,200
right now but only because network that

485
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:38,670
connect well these sensors and actuators

486
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,160
of the safety critical systems

487
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,270
and so they are separated but just

488
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,529
because of the cost

489
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:54,790
not because of security design that I

490
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:57,220
decide that now for 10 years because a

491
00:35:54,790 --> 00:36:00,340
carpet is designed now it's going to be

492
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:03,069
of the road in 5-10 years the car that

493
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,600
we are going to fight here will designed

494
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:09,550
that before

495
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:12,549
my colleagues at UCSD from the car that

496
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:15,460
are going to be by next year were

497
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:18,580
designed after but nobody cared the

498
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:21,910
first cars that are going to be designed

499
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:27,460
after trial crash raised the alarm are

500
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:29,379
going to tell 2025 and we are now maybe

501
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:34,780
they're going to be designed better than

502
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:40,810
we are so in conclusion when we look at

503
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:49,330
cyber-physical system in particular I

504
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:53,160
think a lot of researchers tell see that

505
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:53,160
we think too much about my research

506
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,950
people think that man the matter has an

507
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,390
exhibition the weather has a stunt the

508
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:07,710
matter to raise awareness but not

509
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:10,470
distracting the industry it makes

510
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:14,390
companies like theater major

511
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:18,118
they send us be used to their customers

512
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:21,020
we focus on building structure

513
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,020
resolution what

514
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:12,710
which is actually the best explanation

515
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,839
that you can find about me my biography

516
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,180
was probably right before in Portuguese

517
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:20,810
but I couldn't follow it this is like a

518
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:26,149
silly comic there's a guy get some

519
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:26,480
biking would a normal person picks a

520
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,020
winner

521
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,020
asai

522
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,799
in the

523
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:50,619
[Applause]
