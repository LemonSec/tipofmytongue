00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,570
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:23,450
I guess we here today again my name is

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,099
Nico sorry about is small me lady as she

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,070
felt computers don't work you supposed

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:32,840
to all right so let's not make these

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:34,070
representations so before we start let

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,460
me ask you a question because I'm sure

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,410
everyone here somehow know about

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,190
computers or at least have some are here

11
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:45,050
and if you are there were computers or

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,149
style you something relating computers

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,129
you are a computer person at home right

14
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,489
like every time someone asked question

15
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:54,739
they will go directly to you and every

16
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:58,489
time someone has a problem that will go

17
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:00,769
to you now I know there's a solution for

18
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,530
like 80% of your problems or at least

19
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:05,179
with your grandmother your grandfather

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,700
you're on call call you and be like I

21
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,790
have a little problem with my computer

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:14,530
there's one solution that takes 80% of

23
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,530
those programs and that solution easy

24
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,479
restarting Saturday so number one fix

25
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:24,800
for most of the problems is restarting

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,500
now when we're talking about computers

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:32,660
on an enterprise level restarting

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:35,000
turnout is much complex problem imagine

29
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,979
we already got a center and I thought

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,520
the center there's so many computers

31
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:46,390
when a computer goes blue screen or a

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:49,270
kernel panic nobody's there to like

33
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,800
I'll also few of like a tree fall in the

34
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,590
middle of the forest no it's actually

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,200
the trees down or not because nobody was

36
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,940
there to area in this case it's sort of

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,100
the same felt like you actually hear it

38
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,590
but like people cult you I'm complaining

39
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,140
about that servant came down and the

40
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,970
public data center design is one of the

41
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,070
worst place you have better me I don't

42
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,220
know if you're not Center but I having a

43
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:15,340
couple and it's cool there's no place to

44
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:19,570
sit down when you're a small computer

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:22,840
and its father is usually far it's like

46
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,680
an airport so like far away it's like

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,200
going to a halt

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,270
nobody wants to go there but every now

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:34,299
that you have to so the main idea of

50
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:37,780
this presentation will be to discuss PNC

51
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,000
and BMC is sort of like what the

52
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,410
different manufacturers thought it would

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,480
be the solution to respond is actually

54
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,790
this is me the research I have done with

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:56,380
BMC I thought myself but also with my

56
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:59,829
partner Matias anyways so we actually

57
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,590
start with the acts of BMC I want to

58
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:05,739
make this a big part of the presentation

59
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,260
which is research research well yeah

60
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,650
obviously we have done Oh BMC but which

61
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:15,540
is kind of like a normal thing where you

62
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:17,010
on information security so I mean is

63
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,659
there's a lot of students in the

64
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,750
audience and and obviously when you're a

65
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:24,629
student you have to concentrate on study

66
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,010
and passing rates and all that there are

67
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,280
other things there's a point where you

68
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:32,849
are working in the security industry and

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,140
at some point you get into a place where

70
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,849
you're uncomfortable we were not

71
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,200
learning out there all the basics that's

72
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,140
the most important part but why not

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,179
learn the basics it's time for to the

74
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,518
next step and that next step is creating

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,519
knowledge the way you create knowledge

76
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,950
is by doing the research in Lotus is

77
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,900
there different type of research that

78
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,899
like put together different knowledge

79
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,329
it's one paper and that that's correct

80
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,970
but in these presentation we're talking

81
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,959
about the originals no that is going

82
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:07,230
like one step farther of your usual

83
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,450
knowledge and that's kind of like an

84
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,940
idea for these presentations to give you

85
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,238
a little concept of like what exactly

86
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,700
research means while talking this case

87
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,649
but these are specifically about PhD and

88
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,130
there we should we have that so the

89
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,289
first thing that we should keep you is

90
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,870
to start creating knowledge going you

91
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:30,060
know to freelance is to start to

92
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,099
understand the technology there's a

93
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,919
point where documentation are not

94
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:38,580
renowned and you have to go deep into

95
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:42,570
the problem and giving you something

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,190
that nobody has ever the way you do that

97
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,289
is that you google and you see not know

98
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,270
fine so after one patient patient is

99
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:53,710
nothing related to your problem

100
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:56,948
so tactical unit auger into reverse

101
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,840
engineer tool to try to see and

102
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,150
understand how that thing actually works

103
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,310
and that's part of a recent watch

104
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,380
document that you actually have a flu

105
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,630
research the other thing is fighting

106
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:39,330
back and that's part of my passion is

107
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:39,330
finally understanding

108
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,450
they're not all the same one of the

109
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,210
firsts most interesting characteristics

110
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:29,810
is the complexity how complex they will

111
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:32,359
be nitrous arm is inside the software of

112
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,970
the curve now in meister and i have

113
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,190
worked like so many people in the

114
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,730
company of friends in other and have i

115
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,380
find like two different type of like

116
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:46,940
people that find surveys there is the

117
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:49,460
person that and is that you will find

118
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,030
the most simple back but it will be the

119
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,690
most complex place in curve so he will

120
00:06:53,030 --> 00:07:00,049
find like in the end of some protocol

121
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,780
but like nobody has ever gone into that

122
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,480
to find the most simple done and then i

123
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,580
have a frame where they will find a lot

124
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,580
writing for a graphically in a place

125
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,930
where area has looked at open source the

126
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,030
first thing you will look at will be on

127
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,460
that but he will find the most complex

128
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,380
community at all and that's the choose

129
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,080
type of cursors like somehow you have to

130
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,820
go you saw a complexity and the reason

131
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,979
for that is that if you don't go on

132
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,050
liabilities from long complexity places

133
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,940
the faster will actually find for you

134
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,220
and then someone's gonna cure so if

135
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,800
you're looking for a serial ass

136
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,040
I got a mouth you have to go deeper in

137
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,650
the code or deeper into your on

138
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,290
understanding of what's going on to find

139
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:46,549
a molarity people the other things you

140
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:48,920
need is obviously not all these are the

141
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,050
same you bought a bike guys that you

142
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,720
might blast and nobody will know about

143
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,360
it and yet again whoever is doing a

144
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,450
cluster and is trying to model location

145
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,180
validities through the foster not be

146
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,010
able to find one conveyance is fine

147
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,140
obviously other walk-throughs I relate

148
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,780
more to an explanation rather obviously

149
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,700
it's very important because depending on

150
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,450
the target looking for it's not the same

151
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,000
to be like

152
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:17,570
targeting a web server that some student

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,930
growth for college and the other things

154
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:26,840
attacking Apache and two different

155
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:33,140
things once more or if you're planning

156
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:38,140
to and they're actually using the web

157
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,140
server for ecology as perfect actually

158
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:45,480
like that's we're actually aim for

159
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,120
housing that's more difficult I know we

160
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,270
should explode Mindy's not there's also

161
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,130
a G's there are one doesn't really

162
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,640
exploit some of them are like impossible

163
00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:03,800
to exploit so that's something to keep

164
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:07,230
in mind a serious gonna die you know

165
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,899
being updated or someone to find about

166
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,570
in or you are actually working and

167
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,120
someone else there's collusion to you

168
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,800
finding someone and someone polish you

169
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,690
that you don't have enough time to

170
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:30,060
prepare it and so is there this race in

171
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:34,140
which basically means you know now let

172
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:38,040
me go through my way to do research and

173
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,830
I think is the way I mean is are there

174
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,599
multiple technologies but kind of like

175
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,660
work his way first you ain't doing them

176
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,490
going against the target is I so

177
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,000
learning about I started reading as much

178
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,620
as possible about whatever they don't

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,660
want to sit up they barman I want to

180
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,220
make sure what would I be looking for I

181
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,980
feel like with my lot of information

182
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,170
about it and to understand which should

183
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,900
be my targets and set up an environment

184
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,540
to test that obviously

185
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,970
the environment is very connected with

186
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,490
the tools ability you see because I have

187
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,020
to prepare the tools for god

188
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,820
environments going to use special

189
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,860
dividers it's going to be my own

190
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,870
disassembler to me someone else's have

191
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,589
left that alone which you attack these

192
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:25,800
specific devices that I'm looking for

193
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:29,580
and they give you two easy never-ending

194
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,859
loop of learning more and more into

195
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,690
reversing in atomic attacks on the go to

196
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,120
binary and at the same time classy

197
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,940
classy should be something that we were

198
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:43,980
doing all the time because fuzzy is the

199
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:49,110
computer working on style because we

200
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:52,140
research your failure actually meaning

201
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,630
we're actually thinking your purpose or

202
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,560
research should be like think and read

203
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:01,410
and understand the computer possibly

204
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,239
just being stupid and like throwing

205
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:08,130
things should be like working now so

206
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,950
even when you have no idea we're looking

207
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,230
for starter like without a very stupid

208
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,270
fuss and then you can go and Google

209
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,950
something a little smarter and in each

210
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,240
other which is still working the

211
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,240
computers working at the same time as

212
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:28,040
you and this is something like super

213
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,040
important this research related to PMC

214
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,519
that it's a lot along the war told us

215
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:41,559
that they have to be MCS on the network

216
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:43,360
around 20,000 of those don't you and me

217
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,800
so they have like 20 some of those and

218
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,600
they were like worried about this to you

219
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,868
of these these devices now when I

220
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,110
contact you

221
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:58,629
the first you have to do is so what

222
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,029
happened mr. this triangle is that this

223
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:04,179
is not just for clients like in any sort

224
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:07,119
of research your currency style you have

225
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:10,410
to know how much time you have in order

226
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:13,600
to see how you invest on this research

227
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,329
the other important factor is scoping we

228
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,529
need to understand what you want to

229
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:22,689
attack and what's the the requirements

230
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:25,720
we retirement do you want to do an

231
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:27,998
amplification attack on this story that

232
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,550
story has to support many different

233
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:32,769
versions is very important because when

234
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,199
you are actually doing the test you are

235
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:37,869
looking exactly for that and finally in

236
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,839
the object what Excel is going to be or

237
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:41,829
you could look for it's going to be

238
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,660
something that allows you to get into

239
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:45,729
the machine something that allows you to

240
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,000
get information

241
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,800
lack of information preserve etc etc

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,440
these are three factors that before you

243
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,550
can start have to think about and start

244
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,690
deciding as you go on if you plan and

245
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:07,660
you just throw yourself anyway this now

246
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:10,750
talk about the actual games so I'm not

247
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,980
gonna spell the Columbian Seco second

248
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,320
freak or what it was like stuff like

249
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,899
baseband

250
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,750
management what it means

251
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:21,790
so basically BMC is as I said before is

252
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,850
a response from major manufacturers

253
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:28,060
today yell how can I remove machine

254
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:31,420
remotely on a data center and what it is

255
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:35,260
basically they are a microbe in there in

256
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,689
all the me two big servers that is

257
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,660
completely independent from the actual

258
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:43,120
course of your server a nice remote

259
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,910
control it you can control it flag

260
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,250
different protocols and aside from I

261
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,899
allow me to reboot machine to measure

262
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:56,199
temperature voltage and fans so in a way

263
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:59,740
everything is a very moving job these

264
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:02,399
are a graph of how a PMC website looks

265
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,990
like as you can see it's a beautiful

266
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,899
graph with all the different sensors in

267
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:11,709
here and tell you exactly the

268
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:15,300
temperature different places but

269
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:15,300
interesting how we have this is like

270
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:22,750
journeys a very old micro inside a huge

271
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:26,829
server that has an append operating

272
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:33,400
system and if you have like a very

273
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:37,660
offensive mind kind of like his mind now

274
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,699
that's how the following members to be

275
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,939
able to connect release micro remove

276
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,270
intro of epsilon power k VA which means

277
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:49,750
pure meteor Mouse into the actual server

278
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,579
and also a spherical soul like a direct

279
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,260
zero to fall to the actual machine and

280
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,060
obviously power management would be like

281
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,030
you can remove at any time you can

282
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:04,959
actually install remove in your braking

283
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:08,079
system of the machine so anyway that's

284
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,390
basically a trap right it's a perfect

285
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:14,530
partner because you have a little micro

286
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:18,660
may be controlled remotely server that

287
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:21,400
to me is one of the perfect color as my

288
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,640
killers like people will be like servers

289
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:28,590
are not perfect battle because the

290
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,120
server you saw it's not portable right

291
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:34,030
actually instead of like yes or no

292
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,730
because these devices works as far as

293
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:38,800
their supply in the server even if you

294
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,840
turn off the server and it's completely

295
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,719
off the fan somehow work you're not is

296
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,910
working they BMC are still working why

297
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,350
because it's all comfortable communities

298
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,500
that you can remotely turn on the

299
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,750
machine right so the DMZ is working all

300
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,370
the time as far as the very very crispy

301
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,440
machine

302
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,490
it's not enough to turn up and there's

303
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,160
no way to turn out as far as you know

304
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,660
this is sort of the architecture of the

305
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,540
BMC with the different masses connected

306
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,319
to the different places in there in the

307
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,910
server

308
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:15,150
Anana both laughing messy and virtually

309
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,910
aluminum-alloy research so every big

310
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:20,640
manufacturer has their own version of a

311
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,920
BMC maybe for those who work is if you

312
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,400
compute compute internal we'll find

313
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:30,089
those names familiar so they last the

314
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:33,630
aircraft HP has the ILO and we know has

315
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,730
the IMM so firstly we begin when we

316
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,980
start doing his Rachel phonetics I read

317
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,950
a lot of information was to figure out

318
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,440
which because they give us need to find

319
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:46,230
priorities in this room so we start to

320
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,320
take into what sort of technology was

321
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,880
behind those PMC's and we survey the

322
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,250
animal choose the recent work we start

323
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,650
with reality over is because our mind

324
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,990
has a lot of these idols to again this

325
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,650
is from HP it was very interesting

326
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:05,459
because was using a microphone that we

327
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:10,530
made 850 this is a micrograph DVDs

328
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:13,350
players and CD players I use so imagine

329
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:16,109
the not very fast so we solution of

330
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:19,708
these things is quite annoying and when

331
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:21,750
the assembly was really nice and he was

332
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:25,140
using this operates a small system

333
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,980
called 3x which raised almost no

334
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,610
information

335
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,710
[Music]

336
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,750
that's all you know so when we started

337
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:34,030
like being geography because most of our

338
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,730
first started we thought like you know

339
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,250
once we are done with that we come over

340
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,730
to our horse is the last version which

341
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:49,330
is what we were looking for after smooth

342
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:51,520
and beautiful 92 94 turned out by the

343
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,040
floor they completely change everything

344
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,320
they changed the position was using iron

345
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,540
instead of the neck and obviously the G

346
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,270
nobody sees them if these again another

347
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,370
operating system but it's a completely

348
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,918
different numbering system so everything

349
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,540
have researched for angle chu was

350
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,179
completely dull so you have to start

351
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:13,870
again each of those things you have only

352
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:20,290
three weeks only two people so we have

353
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:27,870
to you know given our time the best then

354
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:27,870
we went into the Iraq the I were right

355
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:37,059
micro called super H if you are in very

356
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:40,150
old gaming very super a choice you can

357
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:42,610
fight sing us a partner very long time

358
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:46,480
go and I think there's not like real

359
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,610
arcades are actually used super h2 and

360
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,220
but luckily was you news we will she's

361
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,439
had PC balls so it's not like whilst you

362
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,240
gave me you have a full thing rooms and

363
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,820
he's especially wants to extract a few

364
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,799
work he said oh how to like watch you

365
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,820
spying on the other ones we have

366
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,190
actually

367
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:08,019
sister make Angola night mistake thank

368
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:10,450
you for miners myself so our objective

369
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:12,730
was to finally deep that was pretty

370
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,190
awesome vacation that he was remote it

371
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:27,880
is not simple someone told you now to

372
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:30,789
that window that's what I mean they take

373
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:35,080
all the time but they birthday here is

374
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:36,389
that these devices we there is almost no

375
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,649
information about people actually

376
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:39,189
researching or finding we do some you

377
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:43,750
know this

378
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:48,240
we were not my high hopes but the

379
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,240
Machine right now but you think about

380
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:57,100
BMC's are fairly now because basically

381
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,929
the server the server belongs in 2030

382
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,668
that's the belong in your home and got

383
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,769
them alone in your office and these

384
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:06,009
these be here without how do you makes

385
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:11,830
no sense money if you were actually

386
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:15,240
heard a very very loud funds running

387
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:18,639
non-stop and I was like three weeks

388
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:24,750
before there was a lot of days of like

389
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:24,750
very loud research

390
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,110
once we have no Stephanie Mar men have

391
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,360
been enough was this couch either at

392
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:41,139
attack service that's going to be common

393
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,659
among men among all of them here was

394
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,660
that this look a lot different Purple's

395
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,750
that everyone has in common so we

396
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:52,000
understand the protocol so we can learn

397
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,220
and test on the different in the four

398
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,710
different environments different games

399
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:00,970
in any hiding place and this is what we

400
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:03,490
came up with these are like four plus

401
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:07,870
other different school probles that were

402
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:09,580
using they are way more intention of the

403
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,770
whole thing because as usual on a

404
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,010
faction talk between each other they

405
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,540
hate each other so there's no like

406
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,100
standard there's some external

407
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,050
organizations that protect you to

408
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,649
another from now we care about them so

409
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:25,210
like Microsoft in 2000 were like if we

410
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,270
remove the wrong version of their own

411
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,820
protocols so it was reverse it was

412
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,920
annoying but as these were able to find

413
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:37,389
some sort of like common sense which in

414
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:40,710
there the first one we analyzed was

415
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:43,870
smash which is basically a command-line

416
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:47,740
interface on top of SSH

417
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:50,979
since SSH is not easy thing to attack

418
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:53,380
and most of the SSH code was based on

419
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,430
how I saw siren we thought that we

420
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:59,140
should get into that

421
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:01,890
the Astra take a lot of our time however

422
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,380
the interesting thing about

423
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:07,080
is that if you're able to compromise in

424
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,280
your insight machine inside the VFC and

425
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,070
what you're inside in BMC you are

426
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,530
actually the bad future attack so we

427
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:16,439
thought I'd a little also application

428
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,940
reality might be useful for setting up a

429
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,770
correct environment sometimes you find

430
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,429
by not because if you are affected by

431
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:24,389
weather to get into your objective so

432
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,010
this is how I look like

433
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,020
they should be thinking about as much

434
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:32,040
like do they have a username a password

435
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:36,210
and trust me as usual there's a username

436
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:39,149
and password what you get is an S I tell

437
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:44,820
them connections or SSL that allow you

438
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:47,760
to get direct access to Syria so you are

439
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,600
doing message you can you make the

440
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:55,230
Monsieur booth see relaxes you can like

441
00:22:50,600 --> 00:23:01,110
survive press X 12 and there actually

442
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:03,150
opens sorry buyers and when you see me

443
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,600
right serve like a bias menu that you're

444
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:11,070
running remotely through the BMC and a

445
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:13,590
lot of them allow and as you can see

446
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,320
there's a lot of default username that

447
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:19,260
between a penetration test he show

448
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,080
always test for now the other thing that

449
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,980
we look for was SMB everyone has a

450
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,780
recipe and what happened was that again

451
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,500
all these people were using was open

452
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:34,260
source of insight to go against that but

453
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,030
most of them were horrible to bury all

454
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,610
SMD

455
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,970
obviously one find ours we're now like

456
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,719
fine

457
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:46,870
and all these rebels like DC a us to our

458
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,000
abilities but we find out like most of

459
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:53,020
them were global to these S&P

460
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,880
variability reported they fix it but it

461
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,610
was kind of curious that a lot of them

462
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,170
has the same version of experience the

463
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,379
other thing that was very interesting it

464
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:05,110
was a and it is sort of like if you

465
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,240
think you should always do that is that

466
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:11,500
if you're honest as a walk to understand

467
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:15,940
why is this impede providing with a

468
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:19,540
callback account you find information if

469
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:22,900
you go and extract their the MIB files

470
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,180
from the actual paper you will be able

471
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,600
to strike way more information as you

472
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,600
can see

473
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,440
[Music]

474
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,590
this is what a life it was amazing

475
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,620
surprised that we had more work to

476
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,980
increase emissions so there's the guy's

477
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,770
hair about the a PMI Chronicle all right

478
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:27,170
and you feel all that he knows is truly

479
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:29,270
money yeah yeah turn down a lot of

480
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,870
people have by default more like I mean

481
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:40,250
the manufacturer allow you to be simply

482
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:41,689
by by the easier and presented and they

483
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,450
see that there are certain solver that

484
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,850
depends on a BMI and that's we cannot

485
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:51,970
disable by default so let me tell you

486
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:57,080
about a PMI first of all it's Ronald for

487
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:58,210
1623 I help you will help to do many

488
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,699
things

489
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:09,050
ramón limón BMC value warnings were

490
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:11,600
things you know ball pitch temperature

491
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,940
all of that you also like that you get a

492
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:20,080
spherical full our unity this is one of

493
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:20,080
them where can we meet turned out that

494
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:26,649
94 these IP were magazine pulley the

495
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,750
most major protocol in their world and

496
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:30,580
we were like nice they're all like

497
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,789
trying to pretend that everything's

498
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:37,149
there were scrolling war war before they

499
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:39,190
always fight you scare people out they

500
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:41,229
were not actually scared first of all

501
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,630
like super babies that were in there and

502
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:47,799
there are four years what does that mean

503
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:55,299
that the at least I think you should buy

504
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:58,418
possible site for Shiro's right the

505
00:26:55,299 --> 00:27:06,370
first - Cyprus Europe was connect

506
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:10,139
without an occasion at all after like a

507
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:20,129
couple of years maybe same way is not

508
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:23,289
the worst PR rocky of vacation so and

509
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:27,010
there's nothing because when they try to

510
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:29,408
fix it people for in the ATM I said this

511
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:33,070
is part of the design of the warranty so

512
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:37,120
turn out that one of the 34 use

513
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:40,210
different allocation mechanisms one of

514
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,428
them was called an array key and what

515
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:46,679
happened is that there is a handshake

516
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:46,679
right you said my

517
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:38,980
and after a couple of hours so if you

518
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:40,090
ever see six really free nowadays there

519
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,840
is stuff there's no fixer

520
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:46,658
so you can find out the username of that

521
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,330
you can obtain a hash and then run it

522
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:52,139
through hash cap and get the password

523
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:54,279
out of it and it's not hard to do it and

524
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:57,100
after we realized that we started using

525
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:59,380
it on on our penetration Jason different

526
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,000
companies and it's everywhere it's like

527
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:06,519
if you're doing an internal test

528
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,809
externally it's really hard to find but

529
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,639
if you do an internal French with this

530
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,580
you figure out that it's going to be

531
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:15,908
around all the time watching it there

532
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,559
again you're able to Isis a BMC that was

533
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:20,799
generic say we start doing our own

534
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:24,610
research we find a little routine it was

535
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,580
sort of like a pool overflow

536
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:29,830
vulnerability are really hard to exploit

537
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,840
it probably impossible as you can see

538
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,439
there messagelen' to something you can

539
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,869
control

540
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,440
so if you make it

541
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:41,049
6 or less than five actually literally

542
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,820
will emotionally no licks on five then

543
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:45,279
what happened is like legs gonna turn

544
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,859
into like a big number because like -

545
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,570
see be a negative number name is

546
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:52,480
pronounced a huge number

547
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:56,200
cool okay okay the fix inside and then

548
00:29:52,480 --> 00:30:02,559
we dozen and copy that and copy will

549
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:10,779
just all right that's obviously not

550
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:14,168
gonna cool overflow not easy to trigger

551
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:19,899
not easy to exploit takes a lot of work

552
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:26,019
to explain then we went to HCBS that was

553
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:27,850
our next argument and obviously actually

554
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:31,389
attack to the server itself most of them

555
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,649
were using open source server so and we

556
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:35,199
don't want to get into that because

557
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:38,619
that's something a lot of time but we

558
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:42,100
and most of them are using this well my

559
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:44,139
own web server called ATP where our

560
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:53,320
sample then usually make their own web

561
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:55,840
server and there are several scripts

562
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,059
certain PMC's that will give you

563
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,158
information

564
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:01,799
very interesting in those cases for

565
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:05,220
example do on the hybrid yo-yo has this

566
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:07,710
XML Ghana and the Agra has beens CID

567
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,749
discover this providing a lot of

568
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:13,620
information remotely without obligation

569
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:16,320
and this for targeting is very if you

570
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:19,830
have the right finger version as you can

571
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,928
see here then if you write an exploit

572
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:24,059
that will allow you to do a lot of

573
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:26,850
different things especially because

574
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:28,980
these are they have these devices have

575
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:33,379
no protection on any of them modern

576
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:36,840
protection like a teepee and of the

577
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:39,389
novel easier so if you can exactly point

578
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,539
out which is in favor then you get irate

579
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:44,008
and should be a perfect exploit because

580
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:50,820
you will know exciting where everything

581
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:53,730
is allocated so we look at here so we do

582
00:31:50,820 --> 00:32:03,240
that it was us when he goes we're doing

583
00:31:53,730 --> 00:32:07,259
this research like finishing the first

584
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,740
part of our research we was gala to this

585
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:31,799
team from France

586
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:34,190
on as you can see about is that they

587
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:37,499
were exploiting these extremely

588
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:41,040
intelligent so obviously I stopped our

589
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:44,370
clothes you can also the start

590
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,260
you override the return pointer and

591
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,620
maybe not you mangy your shuffle

592
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,570
somewhere Johnny like exploit

593
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,600
technicality no it's not the only do

594
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:57,750
that but what these guys did was it is

595
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,389
small overflow that your vote turned out

596
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:05,190
all right - what Marvel that was the one

597
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:09,380
that decide if the query for the server

598
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:12,540
is coming from local all from Ramona so

599
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,220
what happened in BMC is that everything

600
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,930
is coming from locality that means from

601
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,360
the same server from the server to the

602
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,830
BMC before the end is how can you trust

603
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,500
because like you're right on the server

604
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:27,449
you can trust the BMC now that's more

605
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:29,910
like they modify that barbel through

606
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,600
that series of a they are sending there

607
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:37,800
actually was so instead of like creating

608
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,669
a complex so this just create a

609
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,720
connection a and actually - according to

610
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,850
other user

611
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,130
so in general have a fail because like

612
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:49,740
you're not educating and you'd be done

613
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:51,570
moving and since you were right these

614
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,300
barnable and things is coming from a

615
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,379
local connection there is like

616
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,850
obligations just you know how the user

617
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:02,100
and works beautiful disability that we

618
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,530
find on the eyebrow this is quite quite

619
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:08,429
interesting so it's sort of like an all

620
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:12,120
schools moon ability so what is like we

621
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:15,600
looked at the air and the anarchism is

622
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:19,830
also sort of the convenience and

623
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:25,080
have multiple C c/g is money but turn

624
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:28,319
out that the parameters if you said I'm

625
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,319
gonna get requests those commercials

626
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,400
weary transformer so many to environment

627
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,640
Bibles and then and they will run in CGA

628
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:43,320
me that's the way like GG being used to

629
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:45,449
work everything that happens like 50

630
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,510
years ago and then in one corner because

631
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:49,739
I everyone fix it but for now that

632
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,200
average just bring it back I don't know

633
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:55,020
how they did drainage my brain is

634
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,299
already back and they need so what we

635
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,370
need by this case is a good way to test

636
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:03,870
different is there or not just do

637
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:08,089
another class and then what happen is

638
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:12,569
that you will show you the information

639
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:15,740
that you're right now they're two one

640
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:18,010
two three years you get widowed and

641
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:22,029
actually zero flight

642
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:24,880
running some internal dynamic memory you

643
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:29,440
try somehow to avoid a binary into the

644
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,900
Machine and then Aleksic unity so in

645
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,490
generally they attack here what they do

646
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:39,340
is you point out to Julia this Europe

647
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:44,229
because the atmosphere in general the

648
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:47,800
siege I think the is connected to the

649
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:50,200
content of the body of again but this

650
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,359
was not working so what we have to do is

651
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,609
you have to go there with more research

652
00:35:52,359 --> 00:36:00,340
and you can be over there and find out

653
00:35:57,609 --> 00:36:06,330
we should allow us to write some content

654
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:11,109
inside the Machine turned out that this

655
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:16,390
good by CGI if you simply serve columns

656
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:20,319
it allow us to write up to Anthony I 28

657
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:25,150
Q light into this specific file so what

658
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:29,650
we need again is a load specified we had

659
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:32,609
our own company library and then what we

660
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,609
did was to

661
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,890
that you already chevy and they only

662
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,450
have shown and the entropy of our yard

663
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,710
is like there's no more flow

664
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:54,189
there's no way that we can could have

665
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:58,240
somehow probably have to do penetration

666
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:00,910
test so what we doing here is I am sorry

667
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,040
that we see here is that for this

668
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:07,060
cameras penetration testing tools are

669
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:11,820
used upwards cambio these these books

670
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,820
were here is a known and now the machine

671
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,869
we're going to increase range to target

672
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:24,970
our machine so we call the the exploit

673
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:28,330
what we doing is trying to set up or

674
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:30,879
back to us so you're actually correct so

675
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:34,450
we're running next for now the first

676
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,230
thing with us is a blow these binary of

677
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:41,439
us into that firing the temp folder and

678
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:45,339
then actually to deal if you know she's

679
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,940
shaving and happen is that now the who

680
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:48,849
care

681
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,310
hopefully it's a now now now we have

682
00:37:48,849 --> 00:38:03,690
there is the huge sauna which needs to

683
00:37:51,310 --> 00:38:08,940
be you know maybe MCS waited from there

684
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,940
you run an ie and then boom

685
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,909
[Music]

686
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,900
[Music]

687
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:12,280
in there

688
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,909
[Music]

689
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:40,690
yeah my friend so like to see that

690
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,570
Yvonne and these grow it was trying to

691
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:47,500
bars an XML and somehow I'm going

692
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:51,660
because that's normal stock overflow no

693
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,660
I didn't explain that the French team

694
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,000
yeah he's another part was very similar

695
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,850
but instead of using the parsing

696
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,460
specifically the XML and the other one

697
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,770
he was partially namespace over here for

698
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,270
now but same kind of mistake and she

699
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:18,270
will be playing on again like free which

700
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,270
PMC's

701
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:46,130
like all the ressure from some company

702
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:49,310
explaining how a BMC works he's quite

703
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:53,180
anxious to so this is how generally like

704
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:55,100
a network work relations so what you see

705
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:58,810
there is that the server connected to me

706
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:02,509
tonight and learning to go back server

707
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:05,840
and then that web server then it's

708
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:08,660
connected casserole BMC and then each

709
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,750
BMC are on an isolated Network is

710
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,910
jumping cold Autobot Network I have two

711
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,610
people generally happen there all night

712
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:18,410
out about network outside ok any other

713
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,940
network because either like all the

714
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,420
active people connect and remove

715
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,420
machines

716
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:27,809
equal access now but industry parties

717
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:29,220
like dunn-edwards there's a lot of

718
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:34,970
beauties there are only being seized now

719
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,970
and so what happened in this case and

720
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:45,920
multi-dimensional movement is that what

721
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:51,329
happened is if you compromise the server

722
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:53,549
you can poop CPMC once now on the BMC if

723
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:56,099
you can try to attack out of uses as I

724
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:58,680
show I show you my neck an exploit for

725
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:00,450
di before I show you an extra from DL

726
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,868
either and therefore extra for a

727
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:06,598
different type of T so now if you

728
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:09,180
somehow are able to get me to a server

729
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:12,059
they were there please you're moving

730
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:14,460
from one level to the other so you get

731
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:16,200
internet through like our wings do

732
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,109
whatever it is you compromised the

733
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,390
server from the server compromising

734
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:23,700
community it's not complicated because

735
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:27,420
you supposed to be like that server I

736
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,930
mean trust with each other because they

737
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,930
are the same

738
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,220
by the classic side of course whatever

739
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,040
reason there are signs for jasa holidays

740
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:42,430
that's on the work so for the server to

741
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:46,540
do BMC you can you can gain access to it

742
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:48,190
even like you can run sort of these draw

743
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,100
actually get assets to be on Hawaiian

744
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,560
music - that we show you from the server

745
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:58,360
to the DMZ because you can create your

746
00:42:53,560 --> 00:43:00,490
own virtual to desert and abnt now you

747
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,970
compromise server you're getting to be

748
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:08,680
MC we'd actually show you the different

749
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:14,169
PMC's now one of those easy you can

750
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:16,690
compromise you somehow should control

751
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:19,540
the server you can you like we believe

752
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:23,560
and we like beautiful see that's

753
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:25,930
something BMC has beautiful cities which

754
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:32,320
basically allow me to mom are involved

755
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:39,339
ISO and the server with your own eyes oh

756
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:41,410
so now you see and now here the network

757
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:44,350
you're not suppose to me in any way

758
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:48,480
so somehow throughout about network

759
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:50,020
you're connected and we like

760
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,330
multi-dimensional

761
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,340
like moving between different networks

762
00:43:52,330 --> 00:44:00,279
throughout non-members like Salah

763
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:03,119
members now the other thing I was

764
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,010
missing when we did all this work was

765
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,680
like whilst we compromise the Machine

766
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:13,800
how can we can continue being on that

767
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,799
machine he was kind of incredible so

768
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:24,340
there now there's a flash readable that

769
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:27,790
Mouse most of the configuration files

770
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:30,640
that you do modify when you are

771
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:33,630
configuring your own BNC one of the

772
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,740
configurations one was the fire

773
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:42,340
so what we are able to compromise a PFC

774
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:44,890
we just changed the chrome to point out

775
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:50,530
to a minor they that we are though so

776
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:52,750
now we have access to the Big Easy UNIX

777
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,390
machines review you need the machines

778
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:58,150
are now the funny thing is done which

779
00:44:55,390 --> 00:45:01,600
makes you outraged when you work you see

780
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:04,480
like our our persistent backer was

781
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:08,200
moving is Musab you have great if you

782
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,780
word and your binder will still be a

783
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:14,020
backslash to grow on you country to be

784
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,390
like that so is sort of like a

785
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,670
impossible to remove an edge well

786
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:22,069
actually have operating system access to

787
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:25,070
the MC and that's something that

788
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:26,600
offer at all so I charged over my the NZ

789
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:30,190
know what I will take guard that there's

790
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:33,799
no antivirus for BMC night so and again

791
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:35,540
you make the factory to be FC deserter

792
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,700
cannot thank you and you know Cobra -

793
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:41,000
arrest Matt made tough as one sort of

794
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,950
like a perfect diamond well finally a

795
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,260
cig news for there was a lot of things

796
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:47,509
that we to more research

797
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,630
one of them is DMA I know the French

798
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:54,230
team was supposed to climb on idler for

799
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,800
DNA DNA means sort of like direct memory

800
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,480
access

801
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:06,890
well maybe have seen to his service and

802
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:10,310
they came as people didn't finish and

803
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:13,670
also there's so many other prophetic

804
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:15,259
protocol requires analyzing like they

805
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,810
have their own like beans

806
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:21,860
BSE sort of protocol that was sure it's

807
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:23,840
updated amazing and then I'll grow those

808
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,240
is all that brain interesting that we

809
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:29,030
were not English scholar I'm sure

810
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,640
they're full box I if you want to move

811
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:32,810
to the research BMC are definitely the

812
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,690
way to go

813
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:38,930
conclusion you should buy there's

814
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:41,240
definitely these PMC's our thermal what

815
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:43,850
we usually recommend when my people can

816
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:47,270
cause them like how do these out the

817
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:48,529
only other design track mundane isolated

818
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:52,670
from each other

819
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:55,040
our network just right done though

820
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:57,230
because you cannot see defeats on these

821
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,710
there's no like level movement going on

822
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:03,200
there that came from playing with our

823
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:05,240
doctor but there's no way to isolate I

824
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,419
don't imagine disconnected but then my

825
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,419
