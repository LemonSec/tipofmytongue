[Applause]

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,330
she also didn't told told some of my

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,320
affiliations I wear a lot of different

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:25,900
apps but what I tried to do as as a side

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,570
to my professional endeavors is provide

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,329
a lot of free information out to the

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,460
global security community to protect

9
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:35,560
networks because not everybody can

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,100
before lots of expensive security

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,410
products particularly consumers you when

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,410
you go home you know friends and family

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sure may ask you how do I protect

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,569
myself and you're like well install

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,090
antivirus and then don't put on even

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,770
things an email so I try to provide some

17
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,670
information to help make that some of

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,740
that work a graph I like to use and most

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,930
of my talks to kind of explain my

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,500
perspective on things this is from

21
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:07,659
virustotal and it's a graph of how many

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,960
unique malware samples are submitted to

23
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:13,509
virustotal every day and the orange line

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:22,059
is they have 300 thousand unique samples

25
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:23,440
submitted on May 20th that I did know

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,460
one through reverse-engineer all that

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,860
there's a whole lot of information out

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,360
but that's what we can detect today the

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,220
steering number is between the orange

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,440
and green line because that's a number

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,080
of malware samples that we don't detect

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,300
that are still delicious but we know an

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,610
awful lot about a threat as security

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,320
professionals we often struggle with

35
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,060
information overload we have too much

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,639
information and we don't know what's

37
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,770
important most not we struggle with ways

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,290
to make use of that and that's what this

39
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:55,160
talk is one way to make use of this at a

40
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:58,070
fairly low cost price another thing

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,520
that's on my mind is one of the features

42
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,979
of technology particularly American

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,899
technology companies are finding more

44
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:09,169
and more ways to get information about

45
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:12,830
us and this is a fairly large book it's

46
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:15,109
about as big as a Bible but goes through

47
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,840
a lot of information on Facebook and

48
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,910
Google the Internet of Things companies

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,500
are creating more and more ways to get

50
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,900
information about us in our private

51
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,430
lives to sell us stuff and that is

52
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,440
something that I would like to reduce

53
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,209
I'm sure that many of you would also

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,250
because we like to just be private in

55
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,810
our private lives I don't know if I were

56
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,910
the care if anybody knows what kind of

57
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,860
diapers I live

58
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,520
my kids I just don't really want people

59
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:43,210
mining everything that I do and creating

60
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,830
some profile for me well we have these

61
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,690
devices that are listening into our

62
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,630
homes right this is an Amazon electric

63
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,120
Alexa that's been in the news last week

64
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,010
I believe and one of the things that

65
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,050
Amazon wants to do is have this device

66
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,540
listening to people speaking even

67
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,760
without giving it it's way quicker so we

68
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,429
pre voice profiles and do all sorts of

69
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,340
interesting things that Amazon wants to

70
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,290
do data science on and bear in mind one

71
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,210
of Amazon's biggest companies or

72
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,549
contracts is the United States

73
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,800
Department of Defense so they were also

74
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,600
a defense contractor that are you

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,060
leveraging some of the technologies of

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,160
voice recognition and facial recognition

77
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,990
for military applications but these

78
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,710
devices are in our homes listening to

79
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:29,740
what we do so there's two particular

80
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,570
threats that I'm concerned about I

81
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,630
assume many of you are concerned the

82
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,700
first is cybercrime I'm not really

83
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,010
worried about me clicking on stuff I

84
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,839
have tons of malware on my laptop that's

85
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,000
because I were at first engineering but

86
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,880
I had young kids I have six kids who

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,520
like climbing games

88
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,890
I might find a laptop they find some new

89
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,310
malicious garbage that they downloaded

90
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,570
under the guise of some made some game

91
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,980
there's not much to compromise for

92
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,730
children but it's designed to get

93
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,140
towards me and my wife our finances but

94
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,910
also minimizing the amount of

95
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,329
information that's just leaked about me

96
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,280
every day as I go about my business in

97
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,130
the United States and I assume in other

98
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,800
countries is a big debate about

99
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,390
monitoring DNS words in terms of the

100
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,000
host things you go to as you go out

101
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,469
during the internet and Internet service

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,019
providers want to use that information

103
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,790
to create marketing profiles well I can

104
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,219
tell them awful lot about somebody based

105
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,240
off of what those names they're going to

106
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,000
and about

107
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,740
business I could tell they work for I

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,039
could tell what kind of companies they

109
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,960
shot with the frequent there might be

110
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,250
you know personal information or adult

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,638
web surfing that they're doing they

112
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,280
might not want flagged in a profile so

113
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:48,150
lots of information that be protected

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,489
against but all of this requires DNS the

115
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,818
world and it's actually relatively

116
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,979
amazing DNS was written in 1980 before

117
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:58,830
there was a web browser before people

118
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,180
were still using dial-up modems before

119
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,609
any of the technologies that were

120
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,590
invented you know were invented in what

121
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,659
we know as the Internet today there was

122
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,330
DNS and it basically works the same way

123
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:10,650
it did in 1980 and it takes names and

124
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,740
turn them into numbers it's

125
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:16,400
decentralized we

126
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,110
establish domain rights to various

127
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,840
organizations and countries the system

128
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,949
or less works works at a global scale it

129
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,349
has since the 1980s but since we use it

130
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,630
now we're also Gusev almost every

131
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,699
malware config out there will use a DNS

132
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,340
name to reach out to something and all

133
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,039
of the ad tracking and surveillance that

134
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,130
goes on also uses DNS to reach out to

135
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,960
send information if those things didn't

136
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,750
work they didn't resolve than those

137
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,758
services wouldn't run which is an

138
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,180
essence of this talk is using DNS to

139
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,180
protect

140
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,310
against our against those threats to

141
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,140
privacy they're out there but it's just

142
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,790
transparent thing that all of us use

143
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,289
every day that makes the internet work

144
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,140
that many people don't even think about

145
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,690
even in even in corporate in corporate

146
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,880
environments right even IOT devices that

147
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,670
you can modify you can't modify an

148
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,810
Amazon Alexa but it uses TMS and you can

149
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:16,520
modify how the responses to that DNS

150
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,180
query that makes to get it to be more

151
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,070
preferential things as a relatively

152
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,840
brief overview I'm sure many of you know

153
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,240
what DNS is but it's a hierarchical

154
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,419
system you go to your resolve where you

155
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,580
say I want to go to www.google.com it

156
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,490
queries the root servers where it's Dom

157
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,750
if it's not - where's google.com and

158
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,890
then it goes to Google so where does

159
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,999
www-what the important thing about this

160
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,369
craft is the most

161
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:46,279
or device down there is the users

162
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:48,469
primary DNS server of resolver if you

163
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,999
control that you control every device on

164
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:51,469
a network

165
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:54,049
criminals have known this world well

166
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:57,409
over a decade that if they modified DNS

167
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:59,179
to you know pick a bank website then

168
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,409
instead of going to the bank you think

169
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:02,958
you're going to then you're going to

170
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:06,739
some criminals website we can do this

171
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,899
also to for more beneficial results I'm

172
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:13,938
going to block lookups for fishing

173
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:17,299
domains or malware domains or pets by

174
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:18,860
default when most people use DNS and the

175
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:21,019
home environments and even in small

176
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,579
business environments they use whatever

177
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:25,279
their internet service provider gives

178
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:28,519
them they plug in their router it gets a

179
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:31,159
DNS setting with a DHCP and everybody

180
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,589
ignores probably the only exception to

181
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:36,489
this rule is how many people use 8.8.8.8

182
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:36,489
for DNS

183
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:43,929
and that's noon but yeah there's clouds

184
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,939
there also right you have Google and now

185
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:51,339
you have a cloud right how many people

186
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:52,719
use 99.99 that's the only open resolver

187
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:55,569
that actually blocks malicious traffic

188
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:58,149
clouds where in google old sensor quad 9

189
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,679
but we'll get to that in a minute but by

190
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:01,869
March people just don't think about it

191
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,429
you know you can bypass it you can set

192
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:12,219
it on your devices I could set whatever

193
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:14,109
DNS setting on my Google how many people

194
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:24,099
don't think Google is paying attention

195
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:26,229
to what their query so provides a fairly

196
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:27,878
solid and responsive DNS service it

197
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:29,979
works to resolve hostnames

198
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,079
they just happen to use that information

199
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,479
also the same is true for Internet

200
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:36,968
service providers or any other entity

201
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,259
you know you know with the exception of

202
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,139
blog nines and we'll talk about that

203
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:43,630
right I said if you control you on the

204
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:46,060
DNS resolver you can control where that

205
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,100
information goes I need to keep it all

206
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,079
quite a bit we want to expose it if you

207
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,990
want to and you can block whatever you

208
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:57,189
want to because is yours

209
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,380
one aspect of DNS that allows this is

210
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,600
called response policy tones this is

211
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,670
built into the DNS protocol and it's

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,860
basically a special zone you put into

213
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,990
your DNS server and I'll show you

214
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,480
examples of this in a minute it says if

215
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,880
you're looking for a specific record it

216
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,730
will return a different response than

217
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,370
what the authoritative nameserver wants

218
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,010
so instead of going to bad site.com you

219
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,120
could get an ex domain it just says I

220
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,640
don't know anything about that

221
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:30,279
it could redirect them to a different IP

222
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:34,000
address but it's already built in to

223
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:37,300
bind in the one that you can stall with

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,070
after death or rpm you could use it

225
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,579
right out of the box it's also supported

226
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,580
in Active Directory

227
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,709
you can modify or blacklist certain

228
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:55,800
requests over DNS there are four

229
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:58,859
different indicator types that response

230
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,019
policy zones can block or or detect one

231
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,360
one is the specific thing that your

232
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,910
query or a wildfire person you're

233
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,070
looking for WWE will calm you could

234
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,139
redirect that somewhere else you can be

235
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,199
startup google.com you want to block an

236
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,019
entire domain or startup PW if you want

237
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:17,519
to block the entire nation of Palau

238
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:20,310
which is actually not a bad thing to do

239
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,010
because that that top-level domain is

240
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,660
run by basically a criminal organisation

241
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,689
so there's a whole lot of abusive

242
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,579
domains in palau you can block based off

243
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,010
the idea dressed it for as well stupid

244
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:33,449
alright we know lots of IP addresses are

245
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,180
malicious there's lots of twists out

246
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:38,189
there we'll talk about that in a second

247
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,680
and DMS also requires authoritative

248
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,899
servers so google.com has authoritative

249
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,079
nameservers responsible for telling

250
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,410
people query resources under Google you

251
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,279
can blacklist specific main servers that

252
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,279
you think they're malicious

253
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,200
research that I'm doing for my PhD but

254
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,300
we won't go into that here what you can

255
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,040
do you can return an X domain which is

256
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,790
the DNS code for saying this doesn't

257
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
exist

258
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,790
you can return metadata you shouldn't

259
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,319
point it to something else so in a

260
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,510
corporate environment you can point into

261
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,130
a sinkhole if you wanted to to get some

262
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,230
notification hey this machine is

263
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,810
infected with malware and then they see

264
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,730
a webpage pop up saying you've done

265
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,270
something bad stop doing that or take

266
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,880
the machine in between so lots of

267
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:28,400
various things with that that you want

268
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,640
right one of the things that I do it at

269
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,640
home

270
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:38,360
they can be redirected to something that

271
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,359
says dad knows what you're doing stopped

272
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,219
this basically looks like a DNS zone

273
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,680
zone it's all based off of text while

274
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:02,170
states got its own syntax but not overly

275
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,199
complicated you have a list of those

276
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,839
names over here there's a long Part C

277
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,860
name and then dot says it returns an X

278
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,350
domain

279
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:15,880
you start out or you put a fairly simple

280
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,820
to configure so it's all a for loop

281
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,620
basically that I've got a list of IP

282
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,350
addresses I've got a list of bad host

283
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,029
names I hear it all through that and I

284
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,130
attached the header up on top that has

285
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,760
some various time-to-live values in a

286
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,820
series of the same things true with IP

287
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,910
addresses except it's done in Reverse

288
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,230
notation because in DNS IP addresses are

289
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,779
reversed because of the hierarchy

290
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,600
involved but you can also do net blocks

291
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:46,880
so in this case you're blocking five

292
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,950
decade 37.0 on that pole

293
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,130
there's lots of entire networks that we

294
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,010
know or that Spamhaus and anti-spam

295
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,680
company publishes lists of just bad

296
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,630
Netflix is by spammers and scammers that

297
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,250
you could populate into there and start

298
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:07,770
blocking entire bulletproof hosting

299
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:09,570
happens you can do the same thing with

300
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,560
name service you see the same thing here

301
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,780
where it's as rpz - nsv name and NSIP

302
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,189
where you've got the host name in there

303
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,470
and then you've got again the reverse IP

304
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,080
address which if you do my Netflix it's

305
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:30,870
fairly simple text-based way to

306
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:32,670
configure it the trick is of course well

307
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,010
one problem that I got at least with my

308
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,630
own kids is we have a smart TV at home

309
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,340
because you can't currently buy in the

310
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,260
United States just normal televisions

311
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,830
anymore so they're like watching YouTube

312
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,830
videos

313
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:55,129
videos that a five-year-old should be

314
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,258
watching you can't really do that on a

315
00:13:55,129 --> 00:14:01,100
smart TV because there's no cook there's

316
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:03,949
nothing to contract with but on using

317
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:08,120
dns settings because the Smart TV just

318
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:10,359
uses DNS I'm one of them and it does

319
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:14,329
whatever the network tells it to do well

320
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:17,480
Google and YouTube and Ben and others

321
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:20,180
have created ways to in DNS force

322
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,920
various safe search things to prevent an

323
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,809
adult material inappropriate things for

324
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,329
minors and you see an example in there

325
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:28,910
with Google we can redirect Google

326
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:30,469
searches to it state search or for

327
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,300
YouTube they have two different versions

328
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,189
of restricting which tech moderate

329
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,139
because there's three different settings

330
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:40,399
there and you do the same thing to thing

331
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:43,459
where you just do a cname of wwe.com to

332
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,370
restrict at Gamescom you do it at BMS

333
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:48,498
I've never touched a smart to you yet oh

334
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,899
the network just tells it you're only

335
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:52,670
allowed to go here and then all of a

336
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:55,370
sudden they can't see whatever if not

337
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,498
just YouTube videos static you know they

338
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,459
can get out there so it's one critical

339
00:14:57,499 --> 00:15:02,660
use case it's at least good for my kids

340
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:04,819
because that I said there is a catch

341
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,259
right the configuration the tools have

342
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,660
been there they've been there for some

343
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:11,240
time not a lot of people use them

344
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,589
because you have to find the data now

345
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,149
the good news is there's lots of data

346
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,850
out there we'll go over that a couple of

347
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,980
slides but there's dozens of many lists

348
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,680
out there with malicious host names and

349
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,300
domain names I produced one that's about

350
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,479
a million domain names

351
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,849
there's hundreds of IP address IP lists

352
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,819
most of those are actually free for

353
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,470
consumers and not free for businesses so

354
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:36,709
there's lots of people neutral lots of

355
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,050
great information and give it away but

356
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:41,529
nobody really helps to enable a way to

357
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,529
make

358
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,009
some of these are documented some of

359
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,709
them or not right there is some who

360
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:51,420
wants the data and there might be some

361
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:54,060
white posting and curation you have to

362
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,519
do it we've implemented because as with

363
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,589
anything free right you make up for the

364
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,079
free but by having to make sure that the

365
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:03,180
data is clean but if in your home or

366
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,310
small business odds are if you're

367
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,019
blocking some website innocently in

368
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,939
Ukraine you're probably not going to

369
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:12,420
access it anyway so those are really

370
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,000
matter but there is lots of data out

371
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,290
there to be have you just need to make

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,759
sure that you're not blocking stuff

373
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:24,660
that's important to you this was an

374
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:27,839
example of a curated feed from Steven

375
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,850
Black repository that you see the link

376
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,589
there but he separates up data in

377
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,050
various classes right if you want to

378
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:36,029
block all the malicious code that the

379
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,380
beautified posters Edward now where you

380
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,540
see other cover lists on there if you

381
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,139
want to block safe news if you want to

382
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,819
on social networks if you want to block

383
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:47,100
pornography or gambling or all of the

384
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:50,569
above you can pick and choose which link

385
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,569
in there and start

386
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:57,009
so the data is fairly usable and about

387
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:59,680
forty to fifty thousand domain names not

388
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:01,720
a lot but good enough start to get

389
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,670
started and blockbuster a number of

390
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,909
things and these are updated on a daily

391
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:11,889
basis so its domains get taken down or

392
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:15,250
suspended there's a change but this one

393
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:23,289
lacks watts adware for instance the

394
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:26,109
various pervasive but there's lots of

395
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:28,600
data out there these slides will be

396
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:32,379
available to you to write all this down

397
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:37,709
but this is just a partial list from one

398
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:41,679
website the number of abusive this means

399
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,390
there are and some of them you know

400
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,760
slice and dice depending on however you

401
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,770
want there's lots of day as I've said at

402
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,900
the beginning of his talk we're not over

403
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,490
loss for data were to loss of tools to

404
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,450
make it useful and do something

405
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,450
interesting things with

406
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,679
but one thing I want to make a point of

407
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,820
is making your own dating and making

408
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,870
your own list they're making that

409
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,730
available to others is that often

410
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,669
threats you see may not be the same

411
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,210
threats that I see different countries

412
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,210
to see different things

413
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,730
[Music]

414
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:22,130
so nobody who really has a truly global

415
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,130
perspective things that happen here

416
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,670
take whatever you see whatever you care

417
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,560
about block and create open resources

418
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,560
there's always a need for more people

419
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,970
doing that in curating all those lists

420
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,620
I've showed you on the previous titles

421
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,410
done for volunteer work right nobody

422
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,449
gets paid to do that and all the empty

423
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,970
ad tracking and surveillance stuff is

424
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,140
almost all volunteer effort take

425
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,540
somebody who's sitting there thinking

426
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,980
about how Google and Amazon and Facebook

427
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,980
is trying to attract today

428
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:02,080
so it's not overly complicated it just

429
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:04,749
takes time and effort and as security

430
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,850
professionals I argue that we have some

431
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:09,840
duty to broader society to help make

432
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:13,919
life better for people beyond just

433
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,449
so certainly creating feeds of data I

434
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,890
think it's important I'll talk about a

435
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,790
couple of my experiences of crazy

436
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:23,100
trading feet there's two main sources of

437
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:27,000
genes that are known to creating one

438
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:29,040
based on domain generation a dta is

439
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,740
basically a mathematical formula that

440
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,200
takes some input and then turns it into

441
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,460
a list of domain names

442
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,620
now we're started using this around 2012

443
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,330
2011 because we got to be better about

444
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,719
taking down demands and getting domain

445
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:47,760
suspended so they coded these DJs and

446
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,800
malware so that whenever the malware

447
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,629
started it would say I'm going to go

448
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,790
query these list of a thousand domains

449
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,790
they would register two or three of them

450
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,159
News has allowed me to reverse-engineer

451
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,590
that figure out what domains are going

452
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,769
to use in a given week try to resolve

453
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,269
any of that and put it into feet so as

454
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:24,119
you see at the bottom of slide is two

455
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:29,119
domain names used by tiny bender which

456
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:32,720
is banking approach so it's fairly easy

457
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,720
it was fairly easy

458
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:40,739
what's the hard what you see from the

459
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,720
command in essence the entirety of what

460
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:45,929
my future generated on is running that

461
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,599
one command parallel throwing a bunch of

462
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:50,429
domains into asynchronous VMs and

463
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,549
putting it into a text file to then

464
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:56,989
parse it into into feeds from there it's

465
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:56,989
not overly complicated

466
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,460
and that's something I've done six years

467
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,799
ago want to use all over the place and

468
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,200
then I've said from there a great list

469
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:11,668
of domains an IP addresses in main

470
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,499
servers that are used by 11,000 some odd

471
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:15,389
organizations all over the world for

472
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:17,879
free and it cost me about a hundred

473
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:19,678
dollars a month and Amazon charges of

474
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:21,159
creating something that's a million

475
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,720
domains which

476
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,000
if you're interested in freaking out how

477
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,309
to reverse engineer DJ's there are a

478
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,440
couple of github repositories that I

479
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:35,928
have linked down there but Johanna's

480
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:38,540
Bader is a swiss switzerland researcher

481
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:40,790
an academic and he does a lot of work

482
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,159
and describes how we reverse engineers a

483
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,260
bunch of DJ's if you're interested in

484
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,240
that as a resource you can check out

485
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,280
this blog but those two github

486
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,419
repositories have a lot of DJ's scripts

487
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:57,290
implemented in Python that will start

488
00:21:53,419 --> 00:22:00,169
generating lists domains I've done the

489
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:02,149
same from our confits like malware is

490
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:04,190
mounters like software which has

491
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,410
configuration items one of those

492
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,309
configuration items is where it wants to

493
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:12,950
talk to the main well there's ways to

494
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:15,490
statically reverse-engineer now we're

495
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,490
very fast

496
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,500
on the slide where I can give it an

497
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,600
example of dark comic or NJ Iraq or

498
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,690
nanopore or pick your family of malware

499
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,809
and then get out all the configuration

500
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:34,559
item from from that and then populate a

501
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:37,020
feed with so I've got a list of usually

502
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:41,580
dynamic DNS host names that are used by

503
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:44,740
malware or remote access tools so

504
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,740
[Music]

505
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:57,968
this is what it looks like at the output

506
00:22:55,899 --> 00:23:00,129
it's fairly simple with it there's no

507
00:22:57,969 --> 00:23:02,249
dynamic aspect to it it just parses out

508
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:04,869
the file itself and rips out the config

509
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:07,059
from just a file so if they've got

510
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:08,649
copies of malware you can run these

511
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:12,629
decoders against it and in this case

512
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:16,839
it's a dark comic that's got a DNS name

513
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:19,478
zero six zero five whatever as many of

514
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:23,408
you know dynamic DNS providers tend to

515
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:25,389
be heavily favored by there's lots of

516
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:28,450
other data in there that's useful for

517
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:30,879
other reasons but but for DNS I can

518
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,679
probably walk that I know I can block

519
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:42,759
that because nothing ever legitimately

520
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:44,619
use it going back to write all of us see

521
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:47,799
lots of things in our own email folders

522
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:53,019
and antivirus or web access logs and

523
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:55,450
forever whatever as an example one area

524
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:57,760
of my research is the various sextortion

525
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,620
that points damage that people

526
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,960
that has been going out the past six

527
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,340
eight months where you've been you know

528
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,799
it says you've been going to naughty

529
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,470
places on the internet send me however

530
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:10,000
much in bit point those Bitcoin wallets

531
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,179
are immensely useful and the same is

532
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,490
true for ransom it's not you can't use

533
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:18,279
it a dmx but creating feeds of that

534
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:21,549
helps track the people behind that down

535
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:23,649
and the same is true for dns saying oh

536
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:26,408
I've seen this game with this URL and

537
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:29,110
this this domain name I'm creating feeds

538
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:33,120
of that to broader society one helps us

539
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,120
all protect each other's to it

540
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,180
in order to make this work you've got

541
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:48,490
feeds of data but running by maybe

542
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,870
sphere to some people right it's

543
00:24:48,490 --> 00:25:00,490
certainly not something you probably

544
00:24:49,870 --> 00:25:03,610
could go to your parents to do another

545
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:09,940
easy open source project that really

546
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:11,979
does make easy use of this data runs on

547
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,690
a Raspberry Pi fairly simple was

548
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,910
installing the glow that instructions

549
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,920
here fairly quickly and then it's just a

550
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:20,500
question of just adding weights to

551
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,600
whatever domains you want to block by

552
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,270
default it was a project born at

553
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,370
tracking and surveillance so out of the

554
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,840
box configuration will block the various

555
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,899
forms of ad tracking and surveillance

556
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,530
that goes on of how people monetize

557
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,270
their websites but blocks things and

558
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,730
wipe those things and you can block the

559
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,720
whitelist anything you want so you can

560
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:46,680
put in as many or many feeds of data

561
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,680
that makes to

562
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,419
but the best part of that is if you're

563
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:00,240
running your own resolver its right

564
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:01,950
meaning it's not the queries on your ISP

565
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,020
you know they'll be routed to the

566
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,670
authoritative nameserver google will

567
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,450
know that you're looking at cool calm

568
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:20,100
but they won't know that you're looking

569
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:25,260
because this is how easy to install

570
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:27,240
install raspy order nee of the operating

571
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:33,330
systems represented there have you run

572
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:35,220
that one proscriptions one of which is

573
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,550
to set the password for the admin

574
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:43,290
interface but you run curl and it just

575
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:44,970
works fairly fairly simple install you

576
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,550
can run a docker you can run it wherever

577
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,220
you want

578
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:52,169
there is one additional stuff because it

579
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,080
is a DNS resolver you've got to tell

580
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:57,030
your devices to use that instead of

581
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,230
whatever the guy has provided default

582
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:04,160
dates so on my network right I've got an

583
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:06,950
access point behind the router I did

584
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,660
company and by default it says okay use

585
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,090
this name server here's your IP address

586
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,580
I simply point it to an internal IP

587
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,770
address corresponding to my raspberry pi

588
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,949
then all of the devices on my network

589
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:23,470
and magically start query the raspberry

590
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:26,390
pi instead of my ISP for DNS words

591
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:28,250
including the IRT devices including all

592
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,610
of the various things because everything

593
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:34,400
uses DMS and everything uses DHCP to

594
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,889
figure out its network settings so this

595
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,590
works on everything fairly quickly even

596
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,270
those even those devices that you can't

597
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:46,490
otherwise modify because there's no

598
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:49,460
access to them the trick is many access

599
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:51,560
points and home routers to make that

600
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:55,130
difficult of non-intuitive

601
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:57,889
I have dd-wrt on my home access points

602
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:00,380
that's fairly simple right but if you're

603
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,390
using the cable access access point and

604
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:06,370
access router you might not even be able

605
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:13,400
to access access that device or

606
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:15,639
difficulty point that's my video DWR

607
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,640
team

608
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:33,210
it breaks everything at home bricks my

609
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:34,649
kids and my wife can't get two metrics

610
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,809
from YouTube I'd be hearing about it

611
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:39,209
right now I'm a no place to fix it for

612
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:40,649
them the good news is this device has

613
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,090
never broken in months

614
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:44,399
still it's still running there's no

615
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,168
issues but if there is that you have to

616
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,500
figure out a way to bypass it either

617
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:51,029
bypass it on a per device basis or log

618
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,600
back into the answers point and change

619
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:56,340
things every now and then you know the

620
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,320
things that I don't want my kids to see

621
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,510
kit block for me because I'm a security

622
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,299
researcher sometimes I go places I'd

623
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,610
rather my kids not go to so I've got to

624
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:10,019
bypass DNS traffic to keep doing my work

625
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:11,610
at home or use the VPN and if the local

626
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,080
machine statically configures its own

627
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,580
DNS server then I will bypass the

628
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:19,100
firewall and there'll be no protection

629
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,100
time almost nothing does that

630
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,260
does that is my own laptop when I get

631
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,500
exclusively pay to do it with all the

632
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,900
IOT devices for whatever reason just use

633
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,230
whatever the network provides them which

634
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,580
is somewhat surprising I think that

635
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,560
surprised that they didn't just use

636
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:40,310
themselves with DNS servers to capture

637
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,899
more information here's what the media

638
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,850
dashboard looks like gives you query

639
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:48,170
volumes and lets you kind of know what's

640
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:51,020
going on this one is the one provided by

641
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:53,840
them are provided by biologists there

642
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:57,170
are 17,000 queries in the last hour

643
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:03,050
one thousand one box 6.5 percent of the

644
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:05,960
queries of what responses and what types

645
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,970
of queries are going this can be very

646
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,740
interesting for people are kind of

647
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,390
curious about what their devices are

648
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,820
doing especially if you have a lot of

649
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,070
smart devices at home is to get idea

650
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,600
what's going on with the traffic that

651
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,889
they're generating they don't really

652
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,889
make it easy to see what you're doing

653
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:42,440
this device is cooling over one of the

654
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:47,809
other benefits things this does because

655
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:50,630
DNS the DMX Bible doesn't run full RPC

656
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:53,000
it runs DNS mask which basically

657
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,440
operates as a for you know block some

658
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,330
things and then forward request of

659
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,220
whatever it doesn't know about you can

660
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,620
sip where queries are forwarded to

661
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,510
so you see several examples right Google

662
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:06,049
is in their cloud sweater with cloud

663
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,658
ones is in their quad 95.9 is in there

664
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:11,510
you could do this over DNS over TLS our

665
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:13,880
DNS over HTTP with a little extra work

666
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:16,399
so that no one can even sniff your DNS

667
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,929
traffic because Dan asked by default is

668
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:25,279
unencrypted over UDP port 53 right well

669
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:27,139
if it's DNS over HTTP HTTPS well then

670
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,669
all the fuss the only one would ever see

671
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:31,689
is that you're sending to your web

672
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:31,690
traffic to

673
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:40,139
and no one except the person serving the

674
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,060
request would see it now the important

675
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,460
advantage of quad 9 in addition to me

676
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:47,419
the only one that I should say quad nice

677
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,620
and open dns will lock malicious stuff

678
00:31:47,420 --> 00:32:01,170
quad knowledge is the only one that

679
00:31:49,620 --> 00:32:04,229
keeps your queries from those queries of

680
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:05,730
the data that I provide them so despite

681
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,010
quad Knights having some measure of

682
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,960
disability into what you were you they

683
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:13,700
don't provide that to any third parties

684
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,740
so you can maintain a degree of privacy

685
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,720
then having list is a simple simple

686
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,450
feature of just putting going to block

687
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,900
list or whitelist and just put the URL

688
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:27,360
in there whatever lift you want to have

689
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,980
the system itself is pretty smart in

690
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,740
terms of figuring out exactly what it

691
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:35,070
wants to block over a variety of formats

692
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:38,580
so I just picked out to the top one I

693
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:42,389
think is our domains which just lists

694
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:45,179
domains and the other one is the bottom

695
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:48,850
servers host file and you see that IP

696
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:50,980
address or host name in figures

697
00:32:48,850 --> 00:33:24,250
what you actually want to walk so it's

698
00:32:50,980 --> 00:33:26,679
not very strict in terms of data which

699
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,480
is good let's do the whole bottom

700
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:30,419
protection but it doesn't have any

701
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,940
capability of blocking my P addresses

702
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:36,179
and it does need to be local or if

703
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,179
anybody

704
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:50,820
or for a small business either but it's

705
00:33:48,370 --> 00:34:30,639
not really able to enterprise deployment

706
00:33:50,820 --> 00:34:59,920
because so what I do at home that's

707
00:34:30,639 --> 00:35:01,540
running so early right but in some more

708
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,280
details of what I've noticed right in

709
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,220
terms of capacity the Raspberry Pi it's

710
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,850
pretty neat device but it is constrained

711
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:12,790
in terms of resources on the PI roll I

712
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:15,690
can block about 2 million entries those

713
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,690
names in domains

714
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,320
1 million entries because you're running

715
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,540
a full resolve where it has to keep cash

716
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,310
that keeps a lot more things than memory

717
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,279
versus doing the real-time lookup of

718
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:31,109
sending to something blocked or not so

719
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,670
there's there's definitely resource

720
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:41,400
constraints in terms of what you can

721
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:44,130
block so primarily on the first device

722
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:49,470
running RPC I focus on bad networks and

723
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:51,960
IP addresses and then focus on all the

724
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:54,868
privacy stuff in the firewall with big

725
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:59,880
lists of domains and then quad 9 to pick

726
00:35:54,869 --> 00:36:03,990
up anything else so provides some pretty

727
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:10,080
decent relatively robust protection at

728
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:13,319
least for my family but if it stops

729
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,200
95% of criminal stuff and my kids are my

730
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,710
wife cooking on something stupid I'll

731
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,379
take that as a win and like I said I run

732
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:26,119
this over at DNS over HTTP on that last

733
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,119
link so my ISP can't see

734
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,440
I've been running this for a few months

735
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,850
now I do travel internationally and I'm

736
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,430
kind of the only tech support for my

737
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:40,020
family so things break I get angry calls

738
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:41,910
my name yet my wife's phone is broken

739
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,210
the better phone's problem not the

740
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:47,460
network but it has interrupted there's

741
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:51,810
been no hangouts my cable service has

742
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:53,760
gone down you know a couple of times but

743
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,100
these devices are relatively recent and

744
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,480
they just run for a long time it's flash

745
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,480
storage so eventually

746
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:09,840
the answer it's fairly stable and could

747
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,700
work for a small business I don't know

748
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,040
if I would trust like that a major

749
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,649
Enterprise to this major enterprise okay

750
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,230
I'm gonna use actual server hardware for

751
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:21,690
DMS but if your small officer can't

752
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,980
afford lots of stuff this can provide

753
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,560
you a whole lot of protection in a

754
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,720
fairly low cost point and all the data

755
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,310
is already out there three you just may

756
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,399
have to wipe those things every now and

757
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,400
then

758
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:35,849
Britany twice I think my first set up

759
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:38,218
there were a couple of things that I had

760
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:40,469
the right list because just applications

761
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:43,920
wouldn't work because of how they were

762
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:46,019
tiny to add tracking network so I'm one

763
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,880
by one case I could say okay this could

764
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:51,868
this could work so I've got a white list

765
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:54,269
is and you can do that entry by entry in

766
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,279
the pyro interface in fact if you look

767
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:58,379
at pretty log you just a you see the

768
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:59,579
queries in real time you can just click

769
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,769
white list and it will wipe this

770
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:04,109
whatever the underlying query was so

771
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:06,988
it's fairly simple with some tuning that

772
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:10,700
took me about an hour I haven't touched

773
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:13,940
the white list in months

774
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:16,700
it's still working and all people save

775
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,890
starts and that stuff operates on smart

776
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,939
TVs and iPads and other devices it's

777
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,940
that I don't

778
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,729
so what are the things like I said

779
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,369
prepping this talk that I gave thought

780
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:35,450
is discussions I've had you know over

781
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:37,220
over the years is there's been you know

782
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:39,379
with the advent of the Facebook's image

783
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,450
emails of the world saying oh don't run

784
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,950
your own email server don't run your DNS

785
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,560
server it's too complicated you don't

786
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:48,140
have the time to superior you know we'll

787
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,630
do all of that for you and oh by the way

788
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,950
loom I know all this stuff about

789
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:56,240
profiles and sell out to the highest

790
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:59,868
pitch there hasn't been a compromise of

791
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,509
the mail server in ten years even though

792
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:05,180
it counts guest usernames and passwords

793
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:06,680
but nobody has compromised post six or

794
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,080
accident right

795
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,330
you know vibe is secure basically out of

796
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,690
the box especially if you're running out

797
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:16,580
on the inside of the network you know

798
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:18,650
the whole concept of the internet was to

799
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,650
allow you know people to interconnect

800
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:24,740
their own devices and figure stuff out

801
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:27,310
and make things work and as time has

802
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,310
gone on

803
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:40,690
right DNS is an example I've mentioned

804
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:42,730
to external DNS providers everybody

805
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,650
knows those there are hundreds of them

806
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:53,140
out there that everybody knows Google

807
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:54,790
and CloudFlare is at the best market the

808
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,600
other thing is they provide no security

809
00:39:54,790 --> 00:40:00,759
my Google and CloudFlare cloud for it

810
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,520
particularly like saying we don't

811
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,650
believe in censorship I'm ok with

812
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,860
blocking ransomware and not considering

813
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:11,530
that censorship I think we can we can

814
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:14,610
deal with blocking criminals and not go

815
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,610
down the slippery slope

816
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,940
[Music]

817
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:39,960
the privacy at the same time in the last

818
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,560
point because this is a talk about DNS

819
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,050
is DNS over HTTP is relatively new

820
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,960
development over last year by clouds are

821
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:51,240
by the rule that in the coming months

822
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,650
they want a mandate in the browser which

823
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,299
means by default you're going to be

824
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,070
giving all of your DNS queries to them

825
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,440
and nobody's going to be able to have

826
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,630
any visibility except them including to

827
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,540
protect yourself right this is a bad

828
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:05,370
idea because it's giving the browser's

829
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,470
inclusion with Google to the world full

830
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:09,660
access to information while not

831
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:12,419
providing any real protection and just

832
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:14,160
monetizing I don't know where that's

833
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,720
going to end up they said in the next

834
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,720
two versions of chromium

835
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:32,050
whatever web browser you use and see if

836
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:37,839
it's mandated in your DNS queries to

837
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:41,380
some place in the last point to go to

838
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:44,050
what I'm talk there's lots of people are

839
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:47,020
creating data but we need more lots of

840
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:48,700
this is volunteer work because you know

841
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,280
big companies will do this but then they

842
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,770
sell the product to be enterprises but

843
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,120
if you want to protect families or small

844
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,970
businesses or people who have had a lot

845
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:02,380
of money who rely on three tools to do

846
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:03,850
that and free information you data so

847
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,950
certainly there are a lot of projects

848
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:09,400
out there that help even if you're not

849
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:12,399
creating a feat operating sensors so

850
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,770
that feeds can be created one is a do

851
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,720
shield one where the sans internet storm

852
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:18,640
center it's basically it's a Raspberry

853
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,649
Pi honeypot that sits on an external

854
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,930
network and just listens to all of the

855
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,880
traffic that comes through honey bee bee

856
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,919
is another example of a raspberry pi

857
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,609
into the round honey box to go with

858
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:33,609
brute force attacks out there

859
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:35,650
our web servers or SSH and Ron failed to

860
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:42,869
man you could also contribute that data

861
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:42,869
to abuse IP to help protect the system

862
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:48,640
for DNS lists that takes work in terms

863
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:50,410
of ad tracking is just to see where

864
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,910
things are clearly to do that but

865
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,710
certainly we need more people helping to

866
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,989
curate those lists and get more

867
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:59,519
information about bad stuff seeing on

868
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:59,519
the left but certainly whatever you do

869
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:16,470
[Music]

870
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,470
you
