1
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:17,766
 Thank you all, it is strange to speak without listening to anything. 

2
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:21,650
 I did not hear anything he said, so do not believe it. 

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,767
 Sorry for speaking Spanish, but you will prefer my Spanish than my Portuguese. 

4
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:30,779
 That he does not even look like a poor Spaniard. 

5
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:36,999
 But then, I'll try to speak slowly even if I speak quickly so they understand me, 

6
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:40,082
 if you do not understand me you can ask to stop, which I repeat. 

7
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:47,057
 Thank you all for coming, in Portuguese I only learned two words. 

8
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:52,199
 Which are thank you, because of you we are in the World Cup. 

9
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:54,580
 So thank you very much. Thank you for that. 

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:01,336
 And now, yes, let's start the lecture, I suppose you've already introduced me cordially. 

11
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:02,525
 And they told me what I do. 

12
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:08,896
 I work in the Eleven Paths team in charge of the laboratory area of ​​Buenos Aires. 

13
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:12,205
 And also in the position of CCA of the 'Ambassadors'. 

14
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:19,124
 Inside the laboratory of Buenos Aires we do researchs, our task is to do 'researchs' all the time. 

15
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,377
 So that's a very fun job. 

16
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:23,985
 It is unusual since companies do not do 'research' all the time. 

17
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:27,109
 I have the luck to work in one that yes we do, 

18
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,941
 and we have a laboratory that is distributed in several parts. 

19
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:33,331
 We have one in Malaga, one in Valencia, we are in Buenos Aires. 

20
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:37,571
 In Buenos Aires we are few, and we do several things, among them, 

21
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:42,981
 one of the last things we are working on is the HSTS protocol. 

22
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:45,470
 How many know the HSTS protocol? 

23
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:51,331
 Those who do not know should, as it will be mandatory in a short time. 

24
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,581
 So they should seek to know, as Google is demanding by default. 

25
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:58,021
 That they push, but even so, it's a pattern. 

26
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:05,115
 We did a survey that we are going to present in 'BlackHat' in Europe these days. 

27
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:08,726
 In December, as soon as we can not get ahead of it, even so, 

28
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:12,744
 they'll see what we all find out, and besides ... 

29
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:18,345
 This particular lecture is aimed more at 'Malware'. 

30
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,766
 We'll stop a lot in Android Malware. 

31
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:25,963
 Even if it's not just Android Malware. But let's stop about it. 

32
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,941
 I'm sure many here have Android, how many have Android? 

33
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,357
 How many have Iphone? How many have Windows Phone? 

34
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:38,244
 Do not we have victims? 

35
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:40,240
 What about Blackberry? 

36
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:43,781
 Neither. Good. 

37
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:48,742
 Most as we see, the most used phone is Android. 

38
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:52,020
 Usually more in our region, it is a much used phone. 

39
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,221
 It is a widely used operating system. 

40
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:58,244
 It is an operating system with a lot of security problems. 

41
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:01,952
 But that much has been corrected over time, have been improving a lot. 

42
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:04,359
 Even so, there are still things that have not been improved. 

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,226
 You know, the Whatsapp version that circulated in those days. 

44
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:10,615
 And the amount of 1 million downloads. Etc. Etc. 

45
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:13,357
 Well, the idea of ​​this talk is precisely to talk about this topic. 

46
00:03:13,357 --> 00:03:15,586
 So it's good that this has happened. 

47
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:20,231
 Because it further accentuates the research we've been working on for some time. 

48
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:26,265
 Someone when they start analyzing Malware and when they start analyzing malware on phones or cell phones 

49
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,346
 one of the first things you want to know is where it comes from. 

50
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:32,117
 That is, what we would like to know, all researchers, all researchers 

51
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,605
 where this malware was created. 

52
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:41,182
 To be able to assign someone and from there start to draw conclusions, tasks. Etc. 

53
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:42,544
 And some intelligence. 

54
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:46,039
 But really, since the phones have become very complex 

55
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,952
 the reality of any application is too complex to make assignments. 

56
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:52,358
 But the phones have some extra challenges. 

57
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:58,838
 I can not know exactly what country it is, at least I'd like to know what time zone it is. 

58
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,135
 That does not tell me a country, but it gives me a spindle of possible countries. 

59
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:03,243
 And give me some alternatives. 

60
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,844
 It's not the same if a malware was built in Asia than was built in our region. 

61
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:13,315
 Even so, we usually focus on different goals. 

62
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:17,136
 So for some to understand what Malware is looking for if it is just infecting by infecting 

63
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:20,724
 or steal for stealing, or if there is something of background that he is plotting. 

64
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:26,849
 And I say clearly, when I talk about Malware I do not say only about applications that steal money 

65
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,110
 I'm talking about Malware in general. 

66
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,401
 That is, this malware can be translated as malicious code that is something bad. 

67
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:36,142
 And this bad thing can be in a thousand different ways. 

68
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:43,524
 So we know that in the world of phones when we start to see and we seek to know 

69
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:48,401
 what is malware what we have to do is parse APK and RAR files 

70
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51,616
 This is our source of data, that is, our starting point. 

71
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:56,472
 But the APK to the end, are nothing other than a ZIP file. 

72
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:58,647
 Which is a ZIP file. 

73
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:03,428
 That is, I rename an APK file that I downloaded as .ZIP and I can open it and 

74
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,341
 see the contents of all files that are inside that APK. 

75
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:14,442
 I can see all the photos that are stored, all the .RAR files and the system that is stored. 

76
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:22,061
 For which I have a lot of information, but it is a .ZIP. The good thing about a .ZIP is that it allows me to see it easily. 

77
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,897
 The bad thing about being a .ZIP is that it requires all the properties and specifications of what is called PK.zip specifications 

78
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:38,014
 Yes, by which it assumes all attributes exactly the same as a ZIP file. 

79
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:43,286
 What does this means? For example when a file is placed 

80
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,579
 in a ZIP File loses all data in the time zone. 

81
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:52,829
 It is said that in reality what I have is an hour, a date and an hour, of the computer system 

82
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:56,680
 with which I am compiling these files but does not tell me a GMT 

83
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,580
 Do not tell me what time it belongs. 

84
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,460
 For which I have no data. Tell me it's five o'clock in the morning. 

85
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:04,583
 But I do not know from which country. 

86
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:08,921
 So it's five o'clock in the morning here or it's five o'clock in the morning in Argentina, or wherever. 

87
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,117
 So for me, that's a problem when it comes to assigning it. 

88
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:16,737
 We started a few years ago to work 

89
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:20,934
 about malware analysis and what could be happening, and malicious applications 

90
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:26,716
 within the Android sector we encounter this first problem. 

91
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:31,267
 And we were required to build a tool. And from there we started to analyze it. 

92
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:37,130
 Because? Why do we begin to analyze it? Because an Android application 

93
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,464
 not only do you need to have the application files, 

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,649
 but to be on Android needs something more, which is a digital certificate. 

95
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:48,478
 That is to say, yes or yes applications must be signed. 

96
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,695
 That is, if I want to upload an Android application I have to digitally sign it. 

97
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:54,746
 That is a must. Yes! 

98
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,454
 Now, what's the problem is that Android does not require me to have the application 

99
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,067
 be signed by an official authorizing authority. 

100
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,666
 That is, I can build my own authority and sign my applications. 

101
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:15,529
 This, on the one hand, is an advantage, but on the other hand it is imagined that all 

102
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:20,149
 Cyber-criminals do not pay for digital certificates otherwise they use 

103
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,920
 the same certificates created by themselves. 

104
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,282
 So for me, it takes me research points. 

105
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:31,960
 However, the fact that the files are signed gives me a great advantage. 

106
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:36,905
 In fact, they will follow a structure called PKCS. 

107
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,445
 Like the digital signature structure. 

108
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,433
 Where I analyze a certificate I find this data structure. 

109
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:47,729
 And in this framework, I can see a time zone. 

110
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:49,371
 Yes it is here! 

111
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:58,370
 This time hole corresponds to a format called Zulu Time. 

112
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,983
 With Z. Zulu Time. 

113
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,107
 This is where the first two numbers are marking the year, month, day, 

114
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:08,960
 time, minutes, seconds and Zulu information. 

115
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,181
 What does it mean ... Thank you! 

116
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,477
 That means GMT equals Zero. 

117
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:19,878
 It is to say that this file, which I now believe, gives me a time zone. 

118
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,510
 But obviously the other file is just giving me system data. So what do I have? 

119
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:31,005
 On one hand I have the system data of the person who created Malware. 

120
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:36,874
 And on the other hand I have a reference in which the certificate with GMT was created equal to Zero. 

121
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:43,614
 That is, if I have both values ​​I can assume that the two were created at the same time. 

122
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:47,930
 I can say that the person built the APK at the same time that the certificate is generated, 

123
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:49,666
 signs it and places it inside the APK. 

124
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:53,711
 Logically, it can be done at different times, yes, 

125
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:57,544
 but usually when someone creates an application they do it at the same time. 

126
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:02,454
 So the development frameworks allow you to do so at the end of your creation. 

127
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:03,991
 When they are compiling their APK. 

128
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:07,918
 The last step told you: Do you want to add a certificate? Or generate a certificate? Say yes. 

129
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:10,957
 He generates it, and adds it. At that very moment. 

130
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:20,109
 So from there, we build a first tool. What he did was calculate this difference, 

131
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:23,119
 and it's a very simple tool that can download it. 

132
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:25,877
 It's in the free lab, but the only one that makes this tool, 

133
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:38,174
 and I already know what the time difference is and he tells me: 

134
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:42,287
 this app was built in 'such' time zone. 

135
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:49,581
 Until then we said: Ok, we have an interesting data. If what I want to fetch is not a malicious application 

136
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:54,453
 otherwise, what I want to look for is a criminal organization. Generate malicious applications. 

137
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:57,430
 Having more than one, this can be a great first step. 

138
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,801
 What you are certainly thinking is that it does not make much sense to download one by one 

139
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:06,861
 all applications to write by hand. Of course, it does not make any sense. 

140
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:09,868
 For this is only the first step to understand 

141
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:13,104
 how we could break something and how we can from there generate. 

142
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:18,805
 And at that moment, the rest of the things we wanted to do were unlocked 

143
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:23,603
 That was to build a kind of Big Data with a whole solution of ours that allows us to analyze 

144
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:26,596
 all the applications of the story together. Yes! 

145
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:32,240
 That is, being able to download all Android applications, analyze them and cross them. 

146
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,152
 If you wait a minute, I'll share my internet from the phone and 

147
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,485
 this directly into effect. So you see how it's done. 

148
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:44,437
 All right? Give me a second. We do so. 

149
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:49,814
 What we are going to see, is a tool that we have built so that the analysts of 

150
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:54,464
 our equipment begin to work and begin to seek unique standards 

151
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,614
 that in some application is different. 

152
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:01,582
 And let's go to the rest and look for this pattern in all full Android history apps. 

153
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:04,956
 And from there, be able to identify a criminal unit. 

154
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:09,101
 And so to speak, these people are the ones who built all these tools to infect massively. 

155
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,478
 To someone, or a company, an industry, a community or whatever. Or even for politics. 

156
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:26,356
 Well, this is our Dashboard and here we start with everything we're going to do. 

157
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:34,997
 You may have sometimes wondered how many apps there are in google store. 

158
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:38,061
 Some know? More or less. No? 

159
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:46,204
 Well, we'll do a search right now by writing here 'origin: GooglePlay' 

160
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:50,602
 We say that you tell us right away how many applications there are. 

161
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:55,853
 And here it tells me that there are 5 million applications in the Store. 

162
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:59,397
 Yes! So you understand how this works. And now showing examples. 

163
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:05,573
 What did we do. We use Google Apps and from there we build a tool that does what it does: 

164
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:10,107
 Connect once to the Google Store, download all apps from the Store 

165
00:12:10,107 --> 00:12:13,932
 and then every day compares the differences. 

166
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:18,341
 Reconnect and this new application appears If it is new and I do not have it, go down. 

167
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:24,021
 If it is no longer what I had, let me know and mark in our database how this application was withdrawn. 

168
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:28,349
 And the app is gone. This is why I can do specific searches such as 

169
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:36,205
 I can ask inside the reader I can put for example: I will do so to make it faster. 

170
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:52,440
 I can ask which applications with this least are not dead. That is to say they are still in the store. Yes! 

171
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:55,122
 Tell me to this day, they are still in the Store. 

172
00:12:55,122 --> 00:13:00,516
 So we do this research and tell me of the 5 million applications we have in our database 

173
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:09,222
 There are 3 million 799 thousand who are still in the Store. Yes! The rest were withdrawn. 

174
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:13,976
 Either because they are old versions, or because the people who keep them no longer want to keep. 

175
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:16,823
 Or simply because they were Malware and discarded it. 

176
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:19,843
 They are no longer for example Whatsapp. That we talked about before. 

177
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:25,089
 So from this, from having a giant engine in our own cloud 

178
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:29,441
 That we can fetch all applications, the first thing we did was build 

179
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:33,800
 disassemble each of these applications into multiple threads. 

180
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,803
 It is to say that I can now see for example, by each application 

181
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:42,677
 The general information of this application which is the basic information of the application. 

182
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:45,211
 The same one I see in the Store when I want to download an app. 

183
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:51,926
 How many people have gone down, the votes, who created it and, moreover, I can see all the permissions that it has. 

184
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:58,363
 I can see the date of creation of this application, I can see data from the users of the developers. 

185
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:05,381
 I can see comments that are inside the app. I can see all images, which uses this application. 

186
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:10,128
 That is to say that I fully recompile, that is, I opened this APK and now I have it completely for me. 

187
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:12,417
 In fact, let's go back to the original Dashboard. 

188
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:20,008
 Let's go to Home, and we'll get an app any, I do not know, let's look for Vivo, whatever. 

189
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,830
 Snapchat, whatever. Does not matter. And if they realize I put it on. 

190
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:38,759
 Obviously this application has more thing, which is why I also have the internal links that have this application 

191
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:45,344
 And to say that an application I downloaded has links to other sides. I can see and I can select each one. 

192
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,113
 So from this first step, which was the deconstruction 

193
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:53,281
 of all the files that make up this APK and all comments 

194
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:57,482
 of the parts of the code, make up that APK. Now I can look for singularities 

195
00:14:57,482 --> 00:15:00,636
 These singularities can say for example: 

196
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:08,066
 All applications that have this file who also has ... I do not know. 

197
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:14,241
 This particular link has this permission. 

198
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:17,404
 So now I do a research combining all this. 

199
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:23,290
 And will tell me all of the 5 million applications that exist in the Store which match these three characteristics. 

200
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:26,791
 Do you understand? Do you understand the reasoning we've been using so far? 

201
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,311
 We are doing a very simple search, we are doing something very simple. 

202
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:36,838
 In fact, I can start to do much more specific research from here. Like for example: 

203
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:43,344
 I can write, tell me all apps ... 

204
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:53,781
 Let's combine all apps that are in GooglePlay that are still in Google Play 

205
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:59,853
 that is, they have already been withdrawn. 'deadDate today' is that they have been withdrawn today. Yes! 

206
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:10,564
 But I can also find out, in this survey these 231 applications were withdrawn today. 

207
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:15,461
 I can also find out in this survey that in addition they have GMT equal to 1 

208
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:22,774
 Based on what I told you before. Yes! So tell me, with GMT equal to 1, are these apps. 

209
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:26,912
 So now I have all applications that belong, which were 

210
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:29,006
 from the Store, and which belong to a single time zone. 

211
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:38,006
 Yes! Good? Are we done well? We continue to do research. I can even search for developer name. 

212
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:44,399
 That is to say who was the developer of this application. And as an account, I just researched. 

213
00:16:44,726 --> 00:16:49,754
 From GMAIL and tell me all applications that have developed with this GMAIL account. 

214
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:53,026
 In particular, if we see are all the accounts that have seen there below. 

215
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,271
 That is to say I can locate a particular developer 

216
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:01,709
 I can look for apps like the one that just came up with the title. 

217
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,169
 Like Whatsapp. It is to say that I have no other data. 

218
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:07,611
 But an application called Update Whatsapp. 

219
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:12,702
 And I can search this app in the whole Store and realize that there is not one, there are several. 

220
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:17,445
 An application called Update Whatsapp. That this was supposedly forbidden, because you 

221
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:20,089
 they can not send an application that has the same logo. 

222
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:26,720
 You can not upload an application that uses the same business name that created it. Etc. 

223
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,544
 These people, did not respect the logo, changed some pixels so that the robots do not identify it. 

224
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:40,033
 And what he did in the name is that if someone sees it, it looks like the company that created it. 

225
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:46,387
 But really, when one looks at the code has the percent A percent C to create space that is not seen. 

226
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,026
 So that's why you passed the filters. 

227
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,225
 So from here I can see this application and analyze it part by part the amount of permissions it has and more. 

228
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,871
 But I can do things like for example more interesting. I can search apps like this. 

229
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:14,707
 What am I looking for? I'm looking for apps that use flashlights. Yes? 

230
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:17,138
 That is, turn on the light of the phone. Yes? 

231
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:21,213
 But in turn they are not allowed to turn on the light. 

232
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:25,791
 That is to say that they say they are flashlights but are not allowed to turn on the light. Yes? 

233
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:32,245
 And what's more, I'm putting that they're still in the Store. It is to say that they are not dead. Who are still alive. 

234
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:37,327
 Let's see, how many apps do you suppose exist today in the Store. There must not be many, no? 

235
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:46,062
 Let's search. There are 1429 applications that claim to be flashlights. 

236
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,343
 That if you put it down, like a flashlight, it's not a flashlight. Because they can not turn on the light. 

237
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:54,838
 In fact, let's look at one of these. Do not know. For example. Free lantern. 

238
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:03,101
 Let's see what permissions you have, and let's see that you have multiple permissions, 

239
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:05,217
 but is not allowed to turn on the light. 

240
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:10,659
 But to restart the phone, to know the status of the network, to access the camera, 

241
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:12,711
 change the phone setting, etc. 

242
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:19,831
 In other words, I'm looking for a specific feature and I can build a scenario from there. 

243
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:23,979
 In fact, I can do things like, say, all apps 

244
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:28,361
 who has a specific permission. 

245
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:40,017
 On here! I'm telling you all apps that are allowed to call over the phone. 

246
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:46,638
 And, moreover, have a link from an admin console. 

247
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:51,851
 Is to say that if I download this application, it connects to an administration console that is not mine. 

248
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,272
 It is from another. This administration console. This app can call over the phone. 

249
00:19:57,272 --> 00:20:05,378
 Let's see how many there are. I press here and I have 60 different versions of this application. 

250
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:11,110
 That coincide in that. Why is a link from an admin page someone is managing 

251
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:14,633
 and that controls 60 different applications to massively infect people. 

252
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,506
 How far did you understand me? 

253
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:23,248
 This is the construction of our tool to investigate, and from there we begin to investigate many things. 

254
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:27,838
 In fact, we started working ... 

255
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:32,798
 This I'm going to pass, because what I have just shown is what I have if it did not work. The version. 

256
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:35,528
 But then we start doing specific research, for example: 

257
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:39,130
 What would happen if a specific vulnerability comes out tomorrow 

258
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,768
 for a particular service that has a specific port. 

259
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:47,667
 Like for example the PLEX which is this port here. That you see on the screen. 

260
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:56,178
 The 84 43, I could get in here and fetch all the apps in the world that have running on Android 

261
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:58,068
 vulnerability to such vulnerability. 

262
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:05,821
 And we would have all systems easily accessible for that. In fact, look here. We have some of what happened. 

263
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:12,993
 We can look for strange things, such as: Passwords, people who keep passwords in the application. 

264
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:19,150
 In a way to leave coded. So if one looks for this, one imagines that there are not many, but they exist. 

265
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:28,711
 And in fact, here I have on the screen an application that what it did, when I downloaded the application and generated its user and password 

266
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:34,201
 I kept it in a Dropbox account, in a file in Dropbox that was shared publicly. 

267
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:37,969
 By which they see the Dropbox file with all users and passwords 

268
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:40,217
 users who downloaded this application. 

269
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:47,387
 Here we have other examples of the famous Keep Calm, and more here we have a Dialer. 

270
00:21:47,595 --> 00:21:50,138
 That is a pretty interesting application. 

271
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:54,133
 This happened to us ... as we are a telephone company ... 

272
00:21:55,435 --> 00:22:01,726
 Eleven Paths is a unit of the Telefonica group that is the same as Vivo or Movistar. 

273
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:09,282
 There come many requests for research analysis that can happen on phones that suddenly 

274
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:15,044
 if they spent all the consumption, that is, if it consumed everything. He carried the credit, and the next day he had no more credit. 

275
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:16,347
 What happened? As well? 

276
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:21,717
 So from this we start to investigate some cases and we find this type of cases. 

277
00:22:21,844 --> 00:22:27,136
 So where do we have a malicious application, which apparently is a simple application. 

278
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:28,713
 This one is divided into three screens. 

279
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:33,268
 The first is the splash screen, and the application. That's an app for food. 

280
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:41,172
 They make a diet application. So when I downloaded this app the following screen that appeared 

281
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:49,853
 it was the middle one, which is the one that asks you the age, I told you, it's between 18 and 35? Or more than 35? 

282
00:22:50,324 --> 00:22:53,850
 I do not know what they think, but a food app does not have to wonder why they age. 

283
00:22:55,294 --> 00:23:03,853
 The next screen and the third, ask me if I agree to access this APP and if I am over 18 years. 

284
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:09,450
 How many applications do you know that ask the age to see if they are 18 years or older? 

285
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,147
 What kind of applications are they? 

286
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:15,477
 Some are laughing. You already know what it is. I got you. 

287
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:22,388
 Clearly, something was not right in this application. There was something strange. 

288
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,301
 But the strangest thing about this application was not this part, but what followed. 

289
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:34,684
 When you accepted, the application loaded an image and placed a GIF that showed how it was loaded 

290
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:41,061
 all diets, recipes, in theory. And the phone screen looked like this. 

291
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:46,237
 Does anyone know what this is? What's happening on the phone? 

292
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:52,921
 You're starting a call, can you see the green part of the phone? 

293
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:57,595
 That means the phone while you are seeing this black screen 

294
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:02,249
 with the GIF, you're calling someone. And what did that. 

295
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:05,772
 When you accessed this application and accepted, 

296
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:10,971
 the telephone called this telephone registration service by phone. 

297
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,700
 Then they send you a text message to verify. 

298
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:17,730
 The app what I did was, I called and registered. 

299
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:20,832
 Without you knowing anything, the connection will fall. 

300
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:24,974
 When you received the text message, you had permission on your phone 

301
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:29,670
 to do whatever he wanted. I would turn off the buzzer that has the new message prompt, 

302
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,816
 the vibration so that the phone does not vibrate, the touch so that the phone does not make noise, 

303
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:37,503
 then the message would arrive and no message notification would appear. 

304
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,628
 The application opened the message, read the registration access code,. 

305
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:46,649
 carried it and inscribed it. And then I deleted the text message 

306
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:51,137
 By which when you stepped out of this screen, you did not notice any change. 

307
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:55,520
 But what had happened was that they had enrolled you in paid service. 

308
00:24:55,614 --> 00:25:01,286
 Then from there, during all the days that your phone would consume services online. 

309
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:08,052
 Spending all the credit, and your phone would waste battery without you using it. 

310
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:12,053
 This is basically what ends up happening. How do we discover this succession? 

311
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,533
 From the application obviously we find the links 

312
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:20,930
 those that appear there, are from GIF. What's more, we decided to look at the market at the Store. 

313
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,484
 All apps that have this link. 

314
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:27,865
 From there we find the developer who used this. 

315
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:31,058
 So we looked up the developer name in the forums 

316
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:37,124
 and we found that in a forum, the developer asked how to make the phone 

317
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:39,134
 I did not warn you when I had a text message. 

318
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:44,974
 And in this forum, the developer registered with his name, by which we had the concrete data. 

319
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:49,861
 This person was taken to the police to have the criminal arrested. 

320
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:53,570
 And nothing else. This is a bit like the end of the story. 

321
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,541
 So in this model, in this idea, we are in charge of generating a tool. 

322
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,254
 We started looking for different things, and it was just like us without being an antivirus company 

323
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:09,990
 we discovered the first real Android Botnet. What do we seek and why do we build this tool? 

324
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:13,860
 Because what we basically want to do is think of singularities, 

325
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:16,798
 is to think what makes one application different from another. 

326
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:23,183
 And these singularities are often repeated, that is to say that a developer will use it elsewhere. 

327
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:27,398
 Because they are different because they do different things. Then you will not use it just once. 

328
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:33,990
 So from there we started to build our story. In the world of Android, or in the world of phones. 

329
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:39,166
 We have many problems. And these problems are only solved if we share information. 

330
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:42,083
 And the purpose of this talk was to share this information. 

331
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,876
 Share a different way of facing these searches. 

332
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:51,070
 Not being antivirus, not being an NDS, not being NPS. Otherwise building a tool that can serve. 

333
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,608
 There are still many problems to solve today. 

334
00:26:53,608 --> 00:26:56,721
 In fact, as people have learned, because we also have 

335
00:26:56,854 --> 00:27:00,893
 We are looking for the GMT, there are people, companies that are dedicated to change that. 

336
00:27:00,893 --> 00:27:04,023
 That is, to look for other alternatives so that it can not identify GMT. 

337
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,377
 In fact, they remember Hack Team, that Italian company that was hacked. 

338
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,778
 It was a hacking company that was hacked. 

339
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,494
 Who sold the government, remember this company? Remember this story? 

340
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,511
 Well, the e-mails infiltrating the Hack Team had an e-mail that referred to us 

341
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:22,112
 and as we searched the GMT and they were looking for alternatives to dribble. 

342
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:24,499
 So what is the idea of ​​this talk. 

343
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:29,942
 Coming here to share with you in this beautiful conference. It is that you also value. 

344
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:34,664
 Because in cybercrime it affects all of us as users of phones. 

345
00:27:34,664 --> 00:27:37,910
 As end users, to us, our families and more. 

346
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:42,646
 We will never have it, it is up to us to give it up and we will try to hunt it. 

347
00:27:42,646 --> 00:27:44,287
 This is not a tool we sell. 

348
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,447
 This is something we do to investigate. And we publicize it. 

349
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:53,847
 And we try to spread this research. As soon as I finish, I do not have any more minutes. 

350
00:27:53,999 --> 00:28:01,269
 Thank you very much, and I invite you to fight this kind of mafia, and try to help our families, 

351
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:06,925
 our friends and what's more, do not fall for downloading any application and choosing 

352
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:08,590
 carefully. 

353
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:13,196
 Today we think that looking for an application is the best voted or what has 

354
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:20,257
 best comments. We with this tool discovered many bots that add comments 

355
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:28,801
 add votes, download, make people believe that the application is true and have very good positions. 

356
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:32,418
 If someone reads the comments and looks at the stars, you will see that they do not match. 

357
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,298
 You will see that the stars say, 'I have 5 stars' 

358
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,414
 It is to say that I am a very good application, but the comments say 

359
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:42,817
 This app sucks, it does not work. Or something like this. Like it does not make sense. 

360
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:49,429
 So I invite you to collaborate and always spread the message so that we have fewer victims. 

361
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:51,178
 And so that we have more things. 

362
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:55,417
 In the end, I leave my data. Just a second. 

363
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:02,226
 And I leave a final reflection, which is Einstein's. What is: 

364
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:05,718
 We are all ignorant. But we all ignore different things. 

365
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:09,195
 So the only thing we have to fight our ignorance is to share information. 

366
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:10,619
 Thank you all. 

367
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:13,719
 And here I have my data if you want to write to me or to ask me something. 

368
17:18:17,197 --> 17:18:16,197
