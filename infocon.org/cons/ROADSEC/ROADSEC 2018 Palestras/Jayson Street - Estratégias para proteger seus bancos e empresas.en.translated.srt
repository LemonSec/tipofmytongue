1
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:17,369
 So, everyone, this is the beginning of my slides, so is my term of responsibility. 

2
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:21,072
 Because I'm not a lawyer, I'm just a successful internet gambler. 

3
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:27,825
 What is it? That is, when I talk about things in my talk while doing something bad or horrible. 

4
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:31,430
 You're a horrible man. Remember the kitten, I'm adorable! 

5
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:37,007
 I'll never try to steal you, kill you, or ruin your finances and let you pay me first. 

6
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:40,315
 There will always be a contract. So when we get to that point, 

7
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:43,186
 Just remember the kittens and everything will be fine. 

8
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:47,431
 Thank you again for welcoming me here in Brasilia, 

9
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:49,835
 It's my second time in Brazil. And I'm really enjoying it. 

10
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,400
 And that's the talk. 

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,437
 And basically what we'll talk about in this whole lecture is how we deal with risk. 

12
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:03,986
 How we really do not really get close to the things we should worry about. 

13
00:01:03,986 --> 00:01:07,773
 And instead we go after the shiny snowflakes, or these things. 

14
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:09,268
 My God, I need it because it's just one day. 

15
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,024
 But to tell you the truth, no, you have to fix your things. 

16
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:17,167
 So that's a perfect example, this is for the Super Bowl. 

17
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:20,107
 That's what we call the football team championship. 

18
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:24,148
 Play more with the hand, we call 'football'. 

19
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:28,193
 And last year, the vice president of the United States was there, 

20
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:30,440
 and it was a major security event. 

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,837
 Everyone was perplexed as the security, 

22
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:37,364
 they summoned 5000 policemen, for only that stadium. 

23
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:42,883
 They have the national guard, they have the secret service, they have enough. 

24
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,913
 Well, those three teens discovered that they could jump over fences to other places, 

25
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:51,774
 and everyone thought, let's go that way. 

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,241
 And that's what they really did, and when they continued on they found a ladder. 

27
00:01:56,295 --> 00:02:04,159
 One of them, the genius, said: "You know what ... Let's all three of us carry the ladder together 

28
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,084
 and let's go through them and see if they stop us. " 

29
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,983
 And the others, of course, thought it was a good idea. And they did it. 

30
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,655
 And they went through all security. 

31
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:19,106
 They were in the locker room, they were at the top of the stadium, 

32
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:25,458
 They went everywhere, walking by cops, and believe me it's incredible. 

33
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:31,046
 they put everything on youtube, they literally recorded the whole process 

34
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:35,230
 while breaking this priority national security event. 

35
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:42,260
 So while these law enforcement, military forces, and other sources were trying to figure out, 

36
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,521
 you know, all kinds of threats of high priority, 

37
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:48,623
 they were not prepared for three teenagers and a ladder. 

38
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,253
 So we need to work on it. 

39
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:57,499
 This is my slide with different contacts, I do not know what they said about me, 

40
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:02,572
 but I think it should be a good bio. So I'll look at this. 

41
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:08,168
 Now, as I speak of risk management, I have to emphasize how 

42
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:13,260
 it is important for us to understand that as humans, as we disagree 

43
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,459
 out of influence and how this affects risk management. 

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,927
 One of the great examples, was the operation ebola, remember when the ebola 

45
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:27,204
 reappeared in 2015, and in the United States we went crazy. 

46
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:31,525
 We were sealing windows with tape. Ebola will get us, Ebola will get us !! 

47
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:34,006
 Everyone was worried about that, right? 

48
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:38,092
 Everyone was looking for medicine and cleaning up with disinfectants, 

49
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:42,451
 trying to stay protected and safe, not coughing in anyone's face, 

50
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:44,489
 wearing masks, because he could pass the ebola. 

51
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,787
 Two people died of ebola in the United States in 2015. 

52
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,929
 What was bad is tragic. 

53
00:03:53,536 --> 00:04:02,949
 But in the same year, 55,000 people died of the flu. The flu. 

54
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:07,766
 You're there trying to protect yourself with your mask, and you forget to take an injection for the flu. 

55
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:15,132
 You're worrying about Ebola, but you do not take that shot to protect yourself from the flu. 

56
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:19,623
 This is a problem, this is what the reverse of what is sought, 

57
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:22,402
 and what comes next, being two different things. 

58
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:27,628
 Here we can see some of them, these are the green causes of death in perspective. 

59
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:32,352
 In the larger part above, heart and circulatory dysfunction. 

60
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:35,732
 And believe me, I worry about it, I'm old and I really like bacon. 

61
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:39,003
 So I have no regrets, but I worry about things like that. 

62
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:43,111
 I worry about cancer too, I'm worried too. 

63
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:49,303
 But look right up there, really, right there, right at the top. 

64
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:50,873
 Terrorism! 

65
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:54,483
 Followed by war. 

66
00:04:55,811 --> 00:05:01,200
 This is what will kill you while we are afraid of something else. 

67
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,101
 and spending billions of dollars on it. 

68
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,032
 What can really happen to you? 

69
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:12,467
 That is one of the things you should think about, being human how do we accept the risks? 

70
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:17,316
 And also, how do we train people to realize the risk. 

71
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,802
 Our employees. 

72
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:22,841
 A perfect example, if you were a transport security. 

73
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:26,230
 I'm not much of a fan of these security guards, but okay, they hate me too, 

74
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,768
 the same so much that I hate them too. 

75
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:29,803
 So it's a very balanced relationship. 

76
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:35,724
 This is a United States shipping security, confiscating my USB stick. 

77
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:40,683
 They robbed me ... "They confiscated" ... They robbed ... 

78
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:46,574
 So here she has the evidence, and they were dumb in letting me take the picture of it. 

79
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:47,634
 Then fine. 

80
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,316
 But why then did they get my pendrive? 

81
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:57,918
 Because it looks like a grenade! 

82
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:03,936
 That's it. The only reason, that's why ... 

83
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:08,988
 They were afraid of me, thirty thousand feet in the air, I go into the cockpit and say, 

84
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:13,216
 "I'm going to blow this up, I'm going to blow everybody up, this is a kidnapping." 

85
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,938
 That was their concern. 

86
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,411
 Really? Do not. 

87
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,580
 The rule says, that it looks like a gun should not be on the plane. 

88
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,299
 He had no clause to act critically. 

89
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:31,894
 They do not let their agent think for themselves. 

90
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:35,105
 Which is sometimes very good because some people they hire ... 

91
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:41,587
 But in the end they do not let people access any risk. 

92
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:46,419
 They said it looked like a grenade, you can not take it. 

93
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,209
 And I said that they could not get it, I have to destroy it before delivering it to you. 

94
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,702
 The reason for this is, I have USB traps. 

95
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:58,489
 Even in my bag now I have USB drives, 

96
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:01,808
 which if you plug into your machine, will destroy your system. 

97
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:09,229
 And what I thought was that some agent was going to put the pendrive in a federal machine, 

98
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:14,399
 on your network, and I'm going to be convicted of having 'bugged' the TSA (Transport Security Administration) system. 

99
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:16,640
 It's not my fault! 

100
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:22,717
 So that was one of the problems. They also did not let two toothpaste pass. 

101
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:29,820
 But during the hearing, in their system, 90% of the bombs and weapons, 

102
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,872
 which are marked, but who were really looking at other things, have passed. 

103
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:42,001
 90% of real weapons! Because they were busy looking at this sort of thing, 

104
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:44,792
 and 2 containers of toothpaste. 

105
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:48,168
 That they did not really look at the real threats. 

106
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,139
 This is a problem. 

107
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,150
 We did this, and checked the security information. 

108
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,296
 What I mean is zero day. 

109
00:07:56,296 --> 00:08:03,119
 Recently all of this can easily be destroyed on day zero. 

110
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:05,039
 There is no concern about this. 

111
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,816
 Not so much now, because many of those zero days are being fixed. 

112
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,796
 But forget it! 

113
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:23,176
 What about SQL Injection? SQL Injection is the most common way the system is compromised. 

114
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:30,006
 Even so, SQL criminals are still on the internet, this was in 2002. 

115
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:38,006
 To tell the truth, the attack was in 2003, the patch and the vulnerability were announced in 2002. 

116
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:42,997
 We are in 2018, and why is someone running old SQL servers, 

117
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:47,238
 that are unpatched, which allows criminal SQL to attack the internet? 

118
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:51,664
 But it's happening. Because we do not protect ourselves from these things. 

119
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,105
 And when we think about who comes after us. 

120
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:56,189
 Who in your opinion would come? 

121
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:59,625
 Are you really worried about nations coming after you? 

122
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:04,840
 Or are you really worried that some government agency will come after you? 

123
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:11,649
 This is their long list of centers that could be spied on, or that they might worry, 

124
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:16,453
 and even the Pope. Literally, the NSA spied the Pope, 

125
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:19,929
 not the former guy who was scared and wore red shoes. 

126
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:21,797
 But this Pope, the current Pope. 

127
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:28,622
 This guy dresses like a normal priest, and feeds the poor at night. 

128
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:31,391
 He's Batman and the Pope, he's incredible. 

129
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,447
 But if we look at them they are followed, they are spied on now. This is ridiculous. 

130
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:42,328
 If you care about it, then maybe there are nations behind you. 

131
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:43,994
 What about Anonymous? 

132
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:47,833
 Hacktivist, who is included here? 

133
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:54,048
 All right, good work, we already know who they are. 

134
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:56,758
 But I like this one: 

135
00:09:57,353 --> 00:10:00,530
 "Could the Anonymous group really cause any 

136
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,004
 damage to Donald Trump's campaign, how did they threaten? " 

137
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:05,356
 We all know that the answer is no. 

138
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:08,958
 Excuse me! I was thinking. 

139
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,786
 So what else. What about the criminals? 

140
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,505
 What about the people who want to steal you? 

141
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,503
 People who do not care what you do. 

142
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:22,291
 Or what you are selling, where you are or what you do. 

143
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,887
 But they just want money. 

144
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:28,367
 Yes, these are the people you should protect yourself, 

145
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:34,659
 more precisely in 99% of the time, someone just wants to turn you into a bank. 

146
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:36,911
 This is what we need to worry about. 

147
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:39,625
 Not with political statements, not with government agencies, 

148
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,690
 but rather with people who want to steal money. 

149
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:45,128
 Target is a way of seeing what is happening. 

150
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:48,855
 For bad guys, and for safety presentation. 

151
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:54,301
 And it's the key to that, we've developed a subject in this talk. 

152
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,932
 Target was 'broken' by external forces. 

153
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:03,922
 Their company, the company de facto. 

154
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:06,866
 That they have partnerships, was attacked. 

155
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,935
 It was sent by e-mail. And literally the owner of the company, 

156
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:16,430
 had the audacity to say: "We were victims of an APT". 

157
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:21,601
 If APT can use efficient techniques, maybe. 

158
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:27,873
 It had no advance, had no persistence, and had no threat that was successful. 

159
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:31,412
 I'm tired of companies saying that it's always APT's fault. 

160
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:33,872
 When they receive a phishing email that leads to some link. 

161
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:38,450
 This is not an advantage, it is appropriate because it is what we need. 

162
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:42,644
 So it was these double relationships they were trying to break. 

163
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,548
 And the reason, let's see. 

164
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:49,922
 Most workers open e-mail attachments blindly. 

165
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:53,139
 You have a babylon account, let's click here ... you know! 

166
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,547
 Computer company, whatever, you know. 

167
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,409
 A babylon account, beware of that. 

168
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:05,930
 So what I want to do, is that I want to show you, 

169
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,575
 because this thing is serious. 

170
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,859
 Because there are many hacking attacks. 

171
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:16,487
 While you have surveys that are important to protect your company. 

172
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:19,997
 They might not mind that, because everyone was worried about more advanced things. 

173
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:23,762
 I'll show you something simple, but I also want you to understand 

174
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:27,095
 the importance of this, and how I did it, because everyone has 

175
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:30,424
 this mentality that will never happen to me. It will not happen to me. 

176
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:39,569
 Target was saying three weeks before being invaded: "This will never happen to me." 

177
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:43,935
 So I'll help you understand that it can happen to you. 

178
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:46,953
 And I will do this using someone common in the world as a target. 

179
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:52,278
 Not personally you ... may well be you personally. 

180
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:56,569
 But a company, that is local. 

181
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:01,059
 And believe me, I was talking to an employee, it was incredible. 

182
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:05,379
 So I 'Google' the 10 largest banks in Brazil. 

183
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:08,064
 Why would they steal a bank in Brazil? 

184
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:09,964
 They are the keepers of the money. 

185
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:11,933
 That's why we rob banks. 

186
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,189
 So I decided to search Google. 

187
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:19,987
 And I got to the Banco do Brasil. Amazing. 

188
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,165
 That was completely random, I promise. This was completely random. 

189
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:30,336
 The only reason I chose this one, because it says that the Administration is in Brasilia. 

190
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:34,541
 And I thought, "I'm going to Brasilia. What a coincidence." 

191
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:37,093
 Let's go up. 

192
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,324
 Then we will! 

193
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,112
 And then I searched Google, Bank of Brazil. 

194
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,786
 And then I love Google because now they show a lot 

195
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:47,748
 important information shown in the advertisements. 

196
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:51,045
 They show various company information, for free. 

197
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:56,619
 There is the price on the stock exchange, where is the administration, the market value, subsidiaries. 

198
00:13:56,619 --> 00:14:01,110
 And also social networking profiles before I choose other links to enter. 

199
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:03,357
 That was cool and it helped. 

200
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:05,608
 But let's look for more, I want to do some research. 

201
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,870
 I want to do a recon. 

202
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,311
 Remember now, all the time I took 

203
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,887
 looking on Google, "The largest bank in Brazil." 

204
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:21,007
 Until the end of this attack, it was less than an hour. 

205
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,055
 And I was playing World of Warcraft at the same time. 

206
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:27,457
 I was multitasking, I was raising the level of an orc. 

207
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:29,303
 Do not judge me! 

208
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:33,465
 So, come on, to the page. 

209
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:35,433
 A great place to do recon. 

210
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:39,145
 One of the places that is not very good to do reconnaissance is the Dark Web. 

211
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,703
 Usually it's the company website. 

212
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:43,582
 That gives you a lot of information. 

213
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:47,987
 Look how the site works, she is very happy. 

214
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,939
 This is the face of a person who has just been stolen. 

215
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,788
 Because I'm very happy, and this is a great photo to use. 

216
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:58,912
 It's a very professional site, my only problem with this page, is with the data, 

217
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:06,752
 showing what you can see, and I see that I know these things, because they're using HTTP. 

218
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,251
 I'm on the main page. 

219
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:16,238
 And you can access, for sure, I believe, that will change to HTTPS. 

220
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:21,297
 But the problem, is that when you have that main page in HTTP. 

221
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:26,339
 It is not relatively safe for you, but now people can also 

222
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,194
 make phishing attacks and spread it, and still access HTTPS. 

223
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:34,632
 And then no one understands why your site was compromised. 

224
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:38,252
 And it becomes a non-legitimate page. That is the problem. 

225
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:43,141
 Now, once again, we have seen how normal people have seen their pages on the internet. 

226
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:48,328
 I've never, never, ever used the normal keys. 

227
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,353
 So that's how I see their page. 

228
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:53,857
 And now it's also how hackers will see that page. 

229
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,390
 The hacker sees the page with extensions. 

230
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:03,199
 Firefox has several breach extensions. And that's one of the extensions that works. 

231
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,935
 Right now, looking beyond, I'm looking for the IP of the page. 

232
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:14,722
 '170.66.11.10' 

233
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:19,702
 I can also see that the DNS server is 'dns1.bb.com.br'. 

234
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,335
 What does that mean? 

235
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,002
 They are hosting the page on an internal infrastructure. 

236
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,054
 Award Winning! 

237
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:31,847
 I now have not only one page, with an IP address to look for. 

238
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,170
 Now I have more IP addresses and more targets. 

239
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:39,967
 I do not need to find all the vulnerabilities to enter. 

240
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,937
 I just need one. 

241
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:48,595
 So I got these IP addresses, I also got the addresses of domains. 

242
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:49,621
 A total of 47 targets. 

243
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:54,352
 Sorry, 47 hosts, domains is below. 

244
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:56,225
 That will be of great help. 

245
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,115
 And then we look at some pages on the internet. 

246
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:10,897
 'bb.b.br', 'bancodobrasil.com.br', 'bep.com.br', 'estilobb.com.br' 

247
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,178
 I think we can keep the common name. 

248
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:19,901
 But they have all those domains here. And why is this important? 

249
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:25,967
 Because 'bb.com.br' is well designed. 

250
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,882
 It is an e-commerce page, it is a finance page, 

251
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,846
 the programmers did a good job at it. 

252
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:35,726
 So this is incredible, I probably will not find vulnerabilities in this. 

253
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:38,373
 But they are also hosting these other pages. 

254
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:45,776
 And maybe the programmer in 'mtagentpos.com.br' had a bad day. 

255
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:49,556
 He was not the best programmer, who was on task. 

256
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:52,469
 They had good programmers working on 'bb.com'. 

257
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:56,422
 But now they have this guy: "Yes Bob, you have to go now, stay away from us". 

258
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,082
 And that's what he did. 

259
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:04,163
 But if I can access that site, I can get the hosting. 

260
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,794
 And access the server. 

261
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:09,567
 And if I can get it on the server, I can get it on every page. 

262
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:12,833
 Even those who were brilliantly made. 

263
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,322
 And so it is a failure. 

264
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:21,956
 So, I have to ask, is there any Luiz Felipe de Oliveira here? 

265
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,310
 It's all right! Good. 

266
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,793
 Usually you do not put police names on your WHOIS information. 

267
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:33,743
 And you also do not put the names of your employees and emails in your WHOIS information. 

268
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:38,182
 Now you put another target to go after. And also a pretext for me to say that 

269
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:45,925
 was talking to Luiz Felipe the other day, and he told me about the WHOIS contact information 

270
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:51,063
 which must be updated so you can change this link with the new information or you will lose the domain. 

271
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,909
 Simply easy. 

272
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:57,123
 Always use generic names, always use generic emails. 

273
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:59,318
 That passes information to the security department or to the network. 

274
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,452
 Do not use real people. 

275
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:10,908
 So here we have 4 DNS servers. They have over 254 ip addresses to go after. 

276
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:15,389
 Lots of information there, but also on the main page, they show me: 

277
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:21,110
 "Hello, we are also on social networks, contact us" 

278
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,524
 Interact with us. 

279
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:24,236
 And surely I will. 

280
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:27,114
 And that's what I did, I started with LinkedIn. 

281
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:31,209
 I love LinkedIn, the LinkedIn page is really cool. 

282
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:38,554
 They have 43,000 employees ... LinkedIn employees. 

283
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:41,945
 This is incredible, that's a lot of work. 

284
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:46,337
 And believe me, if you want to find me on LinkedIn, please do, 

285
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,170
 I accept all LinkedIn connections. 

286
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:56,314
 We'll see about this later. Here's Instagram, by the way all the banks are on Instagram. 

287
00:19:56,642 --> 00:20:02,603
 And a funny thing is that they have 78,000 followers on the Instagram. 

288
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,587
 They should post cool pics. 

289
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:06,019
 That's all I know. 

290
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,899
 And only following 63 people. 

291
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:13,476
 How do I go after them? I will not. 

292
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,035
 They do not mind following someone, they are just followed. 

293
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:23,653
 But they follow this person, Soraya Lacerda. 

294
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:29,214
 She is following 1197 people. 

295
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:32,278
 But it only has 662 followers. 

296
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:39,214
 Not judging her, I'm saying. She follows a lot of people. And not all follow it back. 

297
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:45,719
 But I followed her with a fake account that was made with interests similar to hers. 

298
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,486
 She'll like it and follow me, right? 

299
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,185
 And I can send a direct message to her, with a compromised link, 

300
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:54,113
 which will compromise her machine, which then we can have 

301
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:57,424
 access her accounts to contact the bank. 

302
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:01,353
 Instagram account of Banco do Brasil. With the link to see some things. 

303
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:05,969
 And believe me, I know this works, because I did it with the United States treasury. 

304
00:21:06,146 --> 00:21:08,289
 It was not fun, but it worked. 

305
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,051
 Also Twitter and Youtube. Here is Youtube. 

306
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:18,497
 One thing I like about their page is that it's all standardized. 

307
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:21,779
 Always use the same pictures, the same icons, is very good. 

308
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:26,749
 It does not matter much that it's cool, not that I need it. 

309
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:32,950
 Here is Twitter, if you see they are following 15 thousand people. 

310
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,295
 That's a lot of people to follow on Twitter. It's a lot to see. 

311
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:44,023
 But again, they have 188,000 followers, I will not look at all those numbers. 

312
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:52,432
 But again, but as our person on Instagram, here's a person on Twitter. 

313
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:56,064
 And this guy looks like the kind of person who would not find it funny. 

314
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,456
 That's okay, why do not we do it. 

315
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:01,610
 I just want to know that this guy follows 633 people. 

316
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:05,369
 And he has only 143 followers. So in this step of the game 

317
00:22:05,642 --> 00:22:09,210
 You either get better or you do not have many followers. 

318
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:16,811
 The problem is, companies do not have Twitter account. They have no account on Instagram. 

319
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:22,251
 But they send emails to people, people use those accounts. 

320
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:26,283
 And if you're listening, on Twitter I spoke earlier, about multiple events. 

321
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,930
 You realize that the people you hire and represent your company, 

322
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:30,876
 can really ruin it. 

323
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:33,868
 So you need to be careful about that. 

324
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:39,381
 Here is Facebook, here it becomes interesting, as it seems Facebook. 

325
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:43,789
 Facebook is incredible. But this does not involve privacy rights. 

326
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:49,141
 The reason is the sharing of life in companies, which makes us try targets in companies. 

327
00:22:49,357 --> 00:22:51,966
 Always one of the first things I do, is to go after them in your Facebook accounts. 

328
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:54,863
 Because if they post something, people will "enjoy" it. 

329
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:57,782
 But does "tanning" really matter? 

330
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:02,599
 Everyone has that friend with a baby, right? 

331
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:07,095
 Always post those photos. "Look at my baby up the stairs." 

332
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:11,112
 "Look at my baby climbing with the kitten." "Look at the baby eating baby food." 

333
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:13,329
 And if you do not "enjoy" any of these photos, you can 

334
00:23:13,552 --> 00:23:15,936
 cause problems the next time you talk to him. 

335
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:18,992
 He'll ask you, "Why did not you 'like' my baby's picture of eating baby?" 

336
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,952
 This is one of the most beautiful pictures of a baby eating potato I've ever seen. 

337
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,316
 You know this picture is not mine, this is my baby. 

338
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,596
 Why did not you like? What will you do? 

339
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:31,997
 So you go there and give it a tan. But do you share? 

340
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,254
 It's good to be prepared, be careful. But you share the photo? 

341
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:43,110
 Because when you share the photo you're saying, "Hey, this is the baby 

342
00:23:43,598 --> 00:23:47,174
 beautiful that I've seen eating poops in my entire life, and I want to share with everyone, 

343
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:51,147
 so everyone can see that baby eating baby food, and I put my name next to him. " 

344
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:52,588
 That's what it means when you share. 

345
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:56,108
 You can say, "It's not my baby, it's yours." 

346
00:23:56,396 --> 00:24:02,149
 This is hypothetical. I'm creating a Facebook focus. But I agree with you. 

347
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:05,462
 But I do not like everyone's photos, so I do not have many friends. 

348
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:09,424
 So, would you share something with a company? 

349
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:14,405
 Who shares this type of post? Employees. 

350
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:17,680
 Because they are good employees, they want to show that they are part of the team, 

351
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:22,167
 so they show on social networks how they and their bosses get along. 

352
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,447
 So that's why I go after them, go after employees who share business posts. 

353
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:33,464
 Like Felipe Daltro. Hi Felipe Daltro. Are you here today? 

354
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:41,185
 One of the things you should stop doing is put pictures of children 

355
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:46,329
 in his profile photos and his cover photo. Stop doing that. 

356
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:51,635
 Because this is public to everyone, and their relatives and friends 

357
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:55,002
 comment on these photos, which are also public. 

358
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:58,082
 So I can get the name of the child, where they are, 

359
00:24:58,236 --> 00:25:00,964
 I get elements that show the place of the exit in the school. 

360
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:06,814
 All this information happens from unsafe posts because it was a public photo. 

361
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:12,281
 Because you made a public photo on the profile. So do not do it. 

362
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:14,799
 But he shared anyway, we were worried about him. 

363
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:21,095
 He works at Banco do Brasil, he has a lot of information there. I do not care. 

364
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,528
 I'm not interested, I'm only interested in who your friends are. 

365
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:25,383
 And here are your friends. 

366
00:25:25,744 --> 00:25:30,967
 And this shows how Facebook is so cool with data ratings. 

367
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:36,740
 All friends are classified as work, school, city, hometown and followers. 

368
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,900
 Which category should I look for? Job? It's what interests me. 

369
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:49,279
 This guy appeared on my radar. Jocelito Szlachetka. It's ... this guy. 

370
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:57,111
 And maybe he showed up because he did not just put a picture of a child. 

371
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:01,714
 "I'm going to put everyone in. You know? 

372
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:07,161
 And there's still the extra that he put the picture of his daughter as a profile photo. 

373
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:09,754
 And that's not a good idea. 

374
00:26:09,938 --> 00:26:12,379
 Say something I can say about it? 

375
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:19,692
 No? Do I care? No. Why do I need to attack from Facebook? 

376
00:26:19,835 --> 00:26:21,996
 I need their names. 

377
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:28,693
 Now that I have the names of two employees who are connected and communicate with each other, they know each other. 

378
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:31,205
 I have everything I need to create the attack. 

379
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:33,701
 They configure their email addresses. 

380
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:35,860
 And how difficult is it to get an email address? 

381
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:42,486
 Well, basically you go on 'email-format.com'. You type bb.com.br. 

382
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,294
 And it tells you how e-mail addresses are kept. 

383
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,294
 So you know his name, and know exactly how those email addresses should be. 

384
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:56,927
 And if that is not enough, guess what. They will show you some sample emails. 

385
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:00,399
 They are used on the internet, and they have. So what is this? 

386
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:03,696
 More targets, for me to go back! 

387
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:09,536
 Now, I have to add a new kitten here. I need you to know ... 

388
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:15,433
 How many people here would answer an email saying you made $ 1 million? 

389
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:23,594
 Exactly! If something is doubtful, we know it would be too good to be true. 

390
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:29,562
 But the problem is, what happens when you get messages from something bad that happened. 

391
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:37,553
 Or you heard the news, that something horrible happened. And someone sends information about it. 

392
00:27:37,553 --> 00:27:42,915
 It's like someone gave you that information. What do you do with that? 

393
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:48,300
 You want to find out why when something bad happens we need information. 

394
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:50,501
 We need to find out what happened. 

395
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:54,524
 After the Boston bomb that was a horrible tragedy in the United States. 

396
00:27:54,686 --> 00:27:59,855
 Two days after the Boston bomb, I got an email saying, "Boston bombing news." 

397
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:10,248
 And in the title and at the end of the email had an address 'IP / bostondonations.html'. 

398
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,664
 And I thought, I'm ashamed of you. You did not even try. 

399
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,280
 This is shameful. 

400
00:28:16,104 --> 00:28:21,480
 But what if I had a daughter who ran in the marathon? What if your family lived in Boston? 

401
00:28:21,697 --> 00:28:24,632
 What would you do? What are you going to do? 

402
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:27,465
 You will enter the link to see what is happening. 

403
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:32,745
 So, so bad guys, like me, with the participation of cats. 

404
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:38,953
 They will find something bad to use, to let the emotions take over, and to enter the link. 

405
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:43,611
 So, what you do? Search Google "Trouble in Brazil". 

406
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:50,374
 If that's what I'm looking for, trouble or tragedy, or horrible, or terrible things. 

407
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:55,670
 You find them all. But with "trouble in Brazil" I found this guy in the middle of my screen. 

408
00:28:55,823 --> 00:28:58,687
 What a downcast face. Let's see more about it. 

409
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:07,072
 And I find out he's a problem now. And he's also stuck today. 

410
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:15,520
 So he's in big trouble. But I see this guy, 'Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva'. 

411
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,601
 I think I can make it worse. 

412
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:21,961
 He has been behind all the protests, and campaigns against. 

413
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:26,674
 So he talks about violence going on, people dying, horrible things going on. 

414
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:28,418
 How can I use this to my advantage? 

415
00:29:29,298 --> 00:29:38,819
 We will see! I am assuming the identity of Felipe Daltro. So I got the ID. 

416
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:43,379
 And I'm sending this to Jocelito Szlachetka. The other guy. 

417
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:47,051
 And then I have the subject line, and note that it's in red. 

418
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,444
 I did not send this email, it would be illegal. 

419
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,419
 I did nothing, just stating for the reinforcements of the law, 

420
00:29:52,572 --> 00:29:55,261
 I do not get involved with crime, I'm just making this presentation. 

421
00:29:58,741 --> 00:30:02,621
 This seems to be dangerous with three exclamation points. 

422
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:07,061
 This is very important because an exclamation point means that it is important. 

423
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:10,094
 Two exclamation points means that you are bold to proceed. 

424
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:15,038
 But three exclamation points, it is serious business. So pay attention. 

425
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:21,200
 I say hello to Jocelito, and I say that I received this disturbing news, that I was sent from that link. 

426
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:22,483
 'badlink.com'. 

427
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:28,287
 Saying how the manifestation by the guy will happen in a few days in the National Library, 

428
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,795
 across the avenue from our office. While this page is saying that there will be violence 

429
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:39,685
 and talks about corruption in the banks involving Jair Bolsonaro, maybe the bank will be targeted !!! 

430
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:44,067
 I'm very worried and I'm not sure who I should report 

431
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:45,768
 to be taken seriously. 

432
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:50,975
 Take care, Felipe Daltro. Sent from a cell phone and imagine this email in Portuguese. 

433
00:30:52,335 --> 00:30:57,376
 One thing to consider in this email is not that it just makes the person join the link. 

434
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,575
 That's because the link is already in the email, so it will automatically double-click. 

435
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:06,665
 Did I say he should look at this? No. What motivates most people to enter the link. 

436
00:31:07,473 --> 00:31:09,305
 And that simply says it was from a mobile system. 

437
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:12,384
 Because I do not know how he says 'hi', I do not know how he says goodbye. 

438
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:15,697
 So when we see it sent from a cell phone, you believe it. 

439
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,313
 And that's the key to everything! 

440
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:21,081
 So people get social media data, 

441
00:31:21,282 --> 00:31:24,353
 people and employees of your company would know that this was an attack. 

442
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,923
 It's not just on the network, it's social media now. 

443
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:30,051
 This is where we gave up, right? 

444
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:36,163
 You know those lectures when the guy comes, I have those vulnerabilities. 

445
00:31:36,443 --> 00:31:44,180
 So that system works, and it's totally destroyed, and then you walk away from the stage. 

446
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,849
 But I've always wondered, and how do you fix it? 

447
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:50,513
 And it always was, I do not know, I just know how to break it. 

448
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:52,368
 It's someone else's job to sort this out. 

449
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:57,537
 These lectures are not legal. If you are going to help, show a solution. 

450
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:01,138
 If you just show me that something is broken, you really are not helping anyone. 

451
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:03,618
 You need to have a solution, you need to help defend. 

452
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:09,539
 I'll say it quickly, we're getting a little bit out of time. 

453
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:15,451
 But it's as if the RedTeams were not there for their breaks to look good at breaking systems. 

454
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:18,995
 RedTeams are there to help BlueTeams. 

455
00:32:19,427 --> 00:32:23,532
 The only reason RedTeams exist is to help defenses improve. 

456
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:26,380
 To help people at BlueTeam improve. 

457
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:28,717
 That's the only reason they exist. 

458
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:33,366
 So if you are BlueTeam without RedTeam threats or not 

459
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,764
 there is a lot of technology involved working on the systems. 

460
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:43,814
 Then go to 'osintframework.com', and learn how to do social searches, without 

461
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:47,622
 be a specialist in making small modifications. That will help you with that. 

462
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,400
 Also, make sure your company does not have employees on PasteBin. 

463
00:32:52,544 --> 00:32:57,415
 When your company is searched, how I looked for Banco do Brasil. 

464
00:32:57,536 --> 00:33:02,744
 The accounts of your customers appears, and this can be bad. 

465
00:33:02,744 --> 00:33:10,230
 And when I say this, literally, there are credit cards, expiration, cvv number and name. 

466
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:12,294
 This is not good. To no one. 

467
00:33:13,445 --> 00:33:18,899
 At Pastebin, it's free to set a keyword for your business. 

468
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,664
 So every time someone adds a word with this key, you get an email. 

469
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,608
 And then you can ask PasteBin for a non-use note. 

470
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:30,706
 And they take it off the page. 

471
00:33:31,145 --> 00:33:37,234
 With this thing being there, over 2 years old. This is September 2017. 

472
00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:44,298
 And another thing we need to see is how your computers and mobile phones connect to the internet. 

473
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:48,410
 I decided to show Shodan.io, this is Brasilia. Very well. 

474
00:33:48,602 --> 00:33:52,891
 And we have those red dots. And believe me, if you think this is bad, 

475
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:56,892
 like us in zombie movies or aliens, they are never good. 

476
00:33:57,131 --> 00:34:00,748
 This is where the dots will take you to a bad place. 

477
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:08,813
 So let's take a closer look at these points. '189.112.118.113' 

478
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:13,949
 It sounds like a very good one, because they use ports 22, 53, 80 and 123. 

479
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:16,069
 Let's look at some of these doors. 

480
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:20,982
 Well, we are forced to use OpenSSH, from time to time we need communication. 

481
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:24,294
 But I'd like to know. Why is this port 80 open? 

482
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,079
 If I were using a device on the network. Why is port 80 on the internet? 

483
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:34,487
 So when I try to know, I get sad. 

484
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:38,568
 PISENSE is an open source firewall system. 

485
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:44,880
 That is, for people who are accustomed to information security. 

486
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,656
 Your firewall should never be online 

487
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:51,906
 through an administrator for a web page. 

488
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:56,166
 Especially this one that is neither HTTPS. 

489
00:34:56,382 --> 00:35:02,606
 The best thing on that page is that overhead saying "Not sure." 

490
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:07,399
 You're right. True words that have never been said. 

491
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:14,039
 I do not know the default user, password, or data. 

492
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,888
 I feel qualified to find out, but who knows? 

493
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,384
 But they ask me, "Jayson, why should I worry about this?" 

494
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:28,192
 Because people like this guy are always looking on the internet and their devices, and other sources. 

495
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:33,069
 Looking for things like that, looking for loopholes, looking for open services. 

496
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:34,988
 Trying to find out what happens. 

497
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:39,420
 This guy on a Friday night decided to look for 1.17 million lodgings. 

498
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:44,221
 To the blue target, with its exploit. To see if they are vulnerable to this exploit. 

499
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:48,003
 He found 33,000 more. Open. 

500
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:54,767
 Because that's what we do on a Friday night, right? Do not judge him, it worked. 

501
00:35:54,918 --> 00:36:02,680
 So if in your company, there are not enough people, there are no people who can do that. 

502
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:04,559
 You can get a BlueTeam in a box. 

503
00:36:04,753 --> 00:36:09,744
 Get a third-party program, get technology out to increase your security. 

504
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:12,105
 And in addition, just search Google. 

505
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:17,248
 Create alerts on Google for when your real name appears, your nickname appears. 

506
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:20,705
 With that you can measure what is happening. 

507
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:24,185
 Now let's talk segmentation. 

508
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:29,427
 I do not know if all the people here work with information security, maybe it's a lot. 

509
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:33,427
 But basically, it's making your own network stop moving on open networks. 

510
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:36,835
 I literally gave up on a connection because the first time 

511
00:36:37,003 --> 00:36:45,020
 which I got in the first hour, I discovered that all that network was 10.0.0.0. Really. 

512
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:52,365
 This means that the CEO's computer was on the same IP address as the email server. 

513
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:55,261
 As in the internet server, there was no DMZ. 

514
00:36:55,262 --> 00:37:00,091
 There was nothing. It was all open. All with unrestricted access. 

515
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:02,843
 There were anonymous internet guests with access points. 

516
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:09,652
 With the company name and an encrypted password. 

517
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:14,850
 That word was 'yes' and was on the same IP address as that network. 

518
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,819
 I literally said, 

519
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,712
 "I can not get your money, you need to hire someone who can build this network." 

520
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:20,046
 You do not need me. 

521
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:23,993
 You're asking me to break your house, but you have no walls. 

522
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:25,171
 I can not do it. 

523
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:28,000
 Also remember to fix your systems. 

524
00:37:28,304 --> 00:37:30,961
 One of the best things that happen with security 

525
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,981
 is when people think they should create corrections. 

526
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:40,030
 Before that time, MSLA 67 was the golden ticket. 

527
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:45,873
 And then MSLA 14 was released and then: "MSLA 14, the new gold ticket". 

528
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:49,049
 But to tell the truth, it was the ruin for everyone. 

529
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:53,435
 And everyone realized that we need MSLA 14 fixes. 

530
00:37:53,435 --> 00:38:00,215
 I know three people who have confirmed that they used MSLA 14, 

531
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:03,185
 but returned to MSLA 67. 

532
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:08,732
 MSLA 67 made less news as Time 14. 

533
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:11,138
 Then you must correct. 

534
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:15,076
 And fixing is important, that's a safety tip. 

535
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:17,558
 This is one of the first things we should implement. 

536
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:21,254
 This is not so bad, and we got some 'bullets'. 

537
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:26,866
 On the second day, we can not, we have to fix our systems. 

538
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:31,075
 You need to mention all of your names, not just your company name. 

539
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,220
 So you have to make sure you're doing it. 

540
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,924
 Any name you have in the company. 

541
00:38:35,092 --> 00:38:40,627
 Make sure you own those words, especially when they have a zero or one. 

542
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:45,173
 The 1 is on top and the 0 is on the bottom. But it still looks like the normal page. 

543
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,932
 And the scariest thing about it. It's just that this is a real page, and that's still available. 

544
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:54,822
 We did not look any further, but I hope the company does, but I doubt it. 

545
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:58,832
 So to defend against possible attacks on the computer. 

546
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:01,578
 You should not have Wi-Fi on when you're not using it. 

547
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,362
 When using Wi-Fi on your phone do not use VPN. 

548
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:08,570
 Never participate in those "What character you are in Game of Thrones" in social networks. 

549
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:12,859
 If I own it, I can find things about you. 

550
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:15,851
 And literally they are in the top 25 as 

551
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:18,403
 recovery of lost passwords from banks and email accounts. 

552
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:23,900
 How would you know that? You want to know if you'd be the captain of 'Lost in Space' or something. 

553
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:29,324
 You should worry about that. Also upgrade your devices including TV, 

554
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:31,931
 appliances, refrigerators, and all your smart devices. 

555
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:35,357
 No one wants to be hacked by the toaster. That would be shameful. 

556
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:38,113
 So keep your smart devices up to date. 

557
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:42,200
 Physical attacks against your system. 

558
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:45,641
 Never put a USB stick without trust. 

559
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:48,849
 You can be sure, I can show you why this is bad. 

560
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:54,978
 Ask about unknown people on your desktop. Let me know before you confront. 

561
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,747
 Quickly get the papers in the printer, do not leave it there. 

562
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,874
 Corporate security I'm going to pass. 

563
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:04,922
 Create moments to teach your employees before a real attack happens. 

564
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:08,196
 What I mean by that is, create a real problem. 

565
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:16,163
 So things that are real to the audience, a conversation with Pinneaple shows you the results. 

566
00:40:16,387 --> 00:40:26,733
 I did a REC conference in 7 minutes, I had 42 professional security professionals access what I asked for. 

567
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:29,613
 This was not bad at all. 

568
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:33,998
 But you know, not so bad. Let's see here. 

569
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:39,598
 Yes, I'm running now, I've been running since the beginning of this talk. 

570
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:43,479
 So in 1 hour I have 90 people connected to me now. 

571
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:58,236
 Iphone, Excel, Sy. Samsung Galaxy, Pedro's Macbook. Someone with a laptop is connected to it. 

572
00:40:58,731 --> 00:40:59,593
 This is not good. 

573
00:40:59,817 --> 00:41:04,570
 This is what I've been doing at the last minute and in the last 40 minutes 

574
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:09,478
 I think some people are disconnecting now. 

575
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:17,025
 And that was not connected on the internet, there was no data coming into my system. 

576
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:21,320
 But if I was the bad guy, I could compromise his system, I could go straight 

577
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:25,650
 wherever I wanted to go. Or anywhere else. 

578
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:32,180
 Now you understand what it means to be attacked. It's a serious flaw. 

579
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,108
 It is not something that just happens to someone else. 

580
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:39,013
 It happens to everyone, including people in a conference. 

581
00:41:39,188 --> 00:41:42,469
 Because a strange guy is showing something. We already are. 

582
00:41:42,637 --> 00:41:45,133
 And so let's get back to that. 

583
00:41:46,929 --> 00:41:50,447
 So remember, employees are active but they can not be accountable. 

584
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:54,606
 Teach them to be cared for, teach them to suspect these activities. 

585
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:01,040
 Show why it matters, use these examples to educate your employees. 

586
00:42:01,183 --> 00:42:02,407
 and better the security that matters. 

587
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,113
 So with that, I'll leave a question. 

588
00:42:07,913 --> 00:42:14,615
 Discussions and issues, or 7 minutes of comfortable silence. I hope. 

589
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,657
 Really, I'm done. Thank you.
