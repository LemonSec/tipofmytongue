1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:18,993
 Well, how are you? This is a police security lecture. 

2
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:22,967
 I'll tell you a little, a very short summary. 

3
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:26,787
 We work with different security forces. 

4
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:31,804
 Some security forces request Pentest. 

5
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:34,144
 External safety test. 

6
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:42,113
 And in that case, I had to work as a pentester. 

7
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:44,554
 By performing external safety tests, 

8
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:48,558
 without access to any kind of infrastructure or anything. 

9
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:52,019
 Well, I come to bring what is disqualified today, 

10
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:56,251
 the results of these tests. 

11
00:00:56,638 --> 00:01:00,509
 This is a circle of conferences with various security forces 

12
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,462
 and today I bring you the Buenos Aires Police. 

13
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:11,028
 All chapters have a police expression in the name. 

14
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:13,142
 So if you do not understand I can explain. 

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,638
 We started, well, a little of who I am, 

16
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,974
 I'm working as SecOps. 

17
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,414
 I worked all my life in what the Government would be. 

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,709
 And I currently have a volunteer job at FreeBSD. 

19
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:31,198
 Do any of you know FreeBSD? 

20
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:35,543
 OpenBSD? Yes. Great. 

21
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:39,943
 Well, I have a few security postures under my control. 

22
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:47,660
 We have a consultancy that deals with the subject of security with the government. 

23
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:51,187
 We are a small company that exists a few years. 

24
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,628
 And we always work with the same subject. 

25
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,167
 Always in government or in federal or armed forces. 

26
00:01:58,923 --> 00:02:00,068
 Well, let's get started. 

27
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:06,530
 At any moment, if you want to ask something, raise your hand, stop and respond. 

28
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:10,314
 Well, first the Legal Notice. 

29
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:15,058
 All information here is educational, they will not hack anything. 

30
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:16,946
 I trust you. 

31
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:20,439
 I trust more than the translator. 

32
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:27,353
 Well, all the scripts that appear here, except the Cross Site. 

33
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:31,442
 They are passive, as we all know about Cross Site, they only exploit 

34
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,785
 the client side with which we are generating a damage. 

35
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,066
 All information is public, that is, 

36
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,690
 any of you could have recreated from scratch. 

37
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:43,162
 Anyone with a search engine could have done the same. 

38
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:46,486
 And no confidential information is disclosed. 

39
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:52,863
 Soon we will talk about Leaks, Dumps, we will show them but censored. 

40
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:56,255
 Also looking for leagues on Pastebin as well. 

41
00:02:56,647 --> 00:03:01,976
 Well, we stick to all Argentine laws, and Brazilian ones as well. 

42
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,903
 I want to start with a phrase from our head of government: 

43
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,302
 What would you say if I spoke today? 

44
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:17,879
 is the most modern police in the world in Argentina? 

45
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,478
 These people know. 

46
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:30,631
 Well, we all know the Argentinean ... Who's going to tell you? 

47
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,519
 Ah, we have the Pope! Ah, we have a queen! We have the most modern police in the world. 

48
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:37,078
 The Argentine is a liar. Liar. 

49
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:40,727
 Strong! Liar! Liar! Strong, strong! 

50
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,140
 Thank you! 

51
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,934
 The Argentine will say that the Eiffel Tower was made by an Argentine. 

52
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,293
 The French are the owners but who did was an Argentine. 

53
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:51,837
 It's a lie! Do not believe in an Argentine for nothing. 

54
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,190
 Me too! 

55
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:54,654
 I'm leaving. 

56
00:03:56,622 --> 00:03:59,885
 Well, the head of government Horacio Rodriguez Larreta, 

57
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:04,206
 commented that from the junction of two police, 

58
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:08,061
 the Federal of the whole country, like the Federal Police of Brazil. 

59
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:11,708
 And the Metropolitan Police only of the city, 

60
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,501
 wanted to join them to become the most modern police in the world. 

61
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:19,126
 This work denies this, from 0 to 100. 

62
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:23,461
 Very short story of the City Police. 

63
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:28,453
 It is created by a law that forms an integral security system. 

64
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:32,669
 As you can see from the left, we have the Argentine Federal Police. 

65
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:36,354
 The Metropolitan Police, which today no longer exists. 

66
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,942
 And the City Police, which is new. 

67
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:48,008
 There is one main issue, the Federal Police is one of the largest police in the world. 

68
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,472
 There are many things, but it is not one of the best. 

69
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:52,056
 We have to be honest. 

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,583
 In many things they are good, but in other things they are very basic. 

71
00:04:57,504 --> 00:05:00,168
 And something very basic is computer security. 

72
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:06,576
 The Federal Police suffered three Leaks with included Defacings, very important. 

73
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:11,110
 Very important, including Leak with Dump 

74
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,951
 of a database of intelligence agents. 

75
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,118
 Which is very dangerous. 

76
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:23,559
 The Metropolitan Police has fewer computer errors, 

77
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:30,838
 but there is one particular mistake that you will see today, which is still productive for 8 years. 

78
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,638
 Eight years. Of a productive error. 

79
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:36,208
 For the whole world to see. 

80
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:38,199
 Security, of course. 

81
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,168
 The Federal Police suffered the three Defacing we talked about. 

82
00:05:43,696 --> 00:05:49,696
 Including theft, extortion and publication of the database of intelligence agents. 

83
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:54,487
 It is to say that they stole, extorted and published. 

84
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,256
 It is a database that I worked with the National Gendarmerie. 

85
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:04,144
 Gendarmería is like a border police, 

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,280
 specialized in drug trafficking and intelligence tasks. 

87
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:13,488
 On the other hand the police depend on the Ministry of Security of the nation. 

88
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:16,801
 This Ministry suffered this year ... 

89
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,616
 Sorry, last year and the previous, 

90
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:23,633
 theft of 30 e-mail accounts, including abuse. 

91
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,440
 An email account that you report a police abuse. 

92
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,058
 An abuse of force. 

93
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,696
 The email account of organized crime, drug trafficking, 

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,389
 rape, ill-treatment of persons, etc. 

95
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:43,133
 All the national criminal information system, go back and 

96
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:46,500
 make a Dump and receive information from all criminals. 

97
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:48,772
 Whether they are condemned or not. 

98
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:52,303
 I mean, if anyone is in a gang of criminals, 

99
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,296
 and is being investigated, and is free. 

100
00:06:56,888 --> 00:07:00,287
 This information has been published, and this person already knows that it was being investigated. 

101
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:07,943
 On the other hand, this has led to a phishing campaign against the ministry. 

102
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:12,356
 The account of the Security Minister was hacked. 

103
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,017
 From that account they published the resignation. 

104
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:17,544
 Saying: I quit my job today. 

105
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:20,696
 Generating a social mess. 

106
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:27,649
 The police had ... the Metropolitan had multiple vulnerabilities on the web. 

107
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:33,872
 From bugs, authentication, to cross-scripting and coding section. 

108
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:41,224
 So I allowed you to get records of incorporations, 

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,304
 that is to say, of new cadets incorporated to the police. 

110
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,792
 Or people who helped the police. 

111
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:58,137
 They could get the records with notes and obviously all their personal identification. 

112
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:02,416
 Also a very big Leak happened in Argentina. 

113
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:11,631
 In which ends up in the resignation of the Director of Critical Infrastructure, what would be cyber-security. 

114
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:18,036
 Well, the City Police inherits most of their systems 

115
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:21,349
 and agents of the Metropolitan and Federal. 

116
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,252
 I mean, the change was made on January 1, 

117
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,397
 and had completed the entire process on December 30. 

118
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:36,432
 What a possibility we have to close all the holes, to give security to that change. 

119
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,463
 And have a healthy critical infrastructure. 

120
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,360
 Zero. 

121
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:45,760
 The City Police today suffered something that was expected. 

122
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,328
 Leaks, Dumps, Injections, Defacing. 

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,704
 Because he inherited the same from the old school. 

124
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:54,544
 The same thing that had never been fixed. 

125
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:58,232
 Well, let's start with the simplest that someone should have done. 

126
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:04,744
 SSL certificates, whether police or not. 

127
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:09,804
 On all visits to our police website, 

128
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,084
 we realized that the certificates were 'Not secure'. 

129
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,659
 The connection is not secure, it can happen for many reasons. 

130
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,843
 But the motive you brought today is to make a laugh. 

131
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:24,747
 So if you want to laugh, you can. 

132
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:29,548
 The error is: Name Certificate Mismatch. 

133
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:33,253
 It means that I have a mauro.com domain. 

134
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,581
 And the certificate said francisco.com. 

135
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:39,144
 So simple, like that. 

136
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:44,000
 They bought a certificate for a name that did not match. 

137
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:51,108
 However, obviously all of this is taxpayer money. 

138
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:54,028
 It's my money, and the rest of the Argentine citizens. 

139
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,486
 How do we know then that the police website is the police? 

140
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:03,568
 If not properly registered. 

141
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,757
 But it does not end here. 

142
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:12,810
 All police websites all use the same certificate. 

143
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:14,968
 Exactly the same. 

144
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:18,450
 That is, a certificate has been generated that applies to everyone. 

145
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,556
 For example: What makes up the security system 

146
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:29,141
 are firefighters, police, private security, 

147
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:32,219
 internal communication, or internal affairs, 

148
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:37,917
 the police news or press, and the gateway firewall that is open. 

149
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:42,821
 The point is, there are a number of redirects, 

150
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:46,045
 a series of DNS records or something obscure in between. 

151
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:49,363
 Because when someone enters the site of citizen security, 

152
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,403
 without a certificate, by HTTP, is redirected to firefighters. 

153
00:10:55,057 --> 00:11:01,338
 And if someone goes into firefighters, by HTTP, private security is redirected. 

154
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,146
 It's like a series of loops and redirs in between. 

155
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:11,138
 Every infrastructure is behind a certificate that does nothing really. 

156
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,514
 Or they are issued in the wrong way. 

157
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,921
 An example image to illustrate. 

158
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:18,464
 The certificate is in the name of Citizen Security. 

159
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:22,473
 I mean, it only applies to one site. 

160
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:25,193
 And that site besides entering does nothing. 

161
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,515
 You can laugh if you want. 

162
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:34,527
 Well, the certificate to verify what we talked about, 

163
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:42,735
 we use two tools, first an outsourced Comodo SSL Analyzer, highly recommended. 

164
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,159
 And second, we created a small script in PowerShell 

165
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:50,799
 which uses OPEN SSL to verify what we are talking about. 

166
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,575
 These are the sites we are looking for. 

167
00:11:56,935 --> 00:12:00,998
 I do not know if they can see the Dump, but it says: 

168
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:05,078
 The certificate was issued for wildcard asterisk. 

169
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,966
 social security.gob.ar 

170
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:12,119
 I mean, it does not match any domain. 

171
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:17,497
 To give neutrality, I commented. 

172
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,568
 We used the Comodo scanner. 

173
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:24,287
 We found that all the certificates, so saying, 

174
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:28,270
 was vulnerable to the following: 

175
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,550
 POODLE is 4 years old. 

176
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:33,407
 SLOTH, 3 years ago. 

177
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,063
 DROWN 2 years ago. 

178
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,384
 Besides, we can talk about HeartBleed, CRIME too. 

179
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:43,482
 But we specify in these three. 

180
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:50,113
 Let's see the result of Comodo, who said just that. 

181
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:54,995
 Well, obviously we concluded that all the certificates, in case one. 

182
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:56,691
 It is invalid. It is vulnerable. 

183
00:12:57,451 --> 00:13:01,011
 If we start thinking about a long-term solution. 

184
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:06,641
 Cheap, fast, even free. 

185
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:10,675
 Use a wildcard as I mentioned here, 

186
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:14,551
 could have saved the sites with a valid certificate. 

187
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,709
 * .policiadelaciudad.gob.ar would also cover 

188
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:21,626
 firefighters, news, private security, etc. 

189
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,602
 It is also scalable, fix a new host, 

190
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:28,434
 would not change anything at all. 

191
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:34,689
 So, why the most modern police that are ours ... 

192
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:38,835
 Laugh, louder. 

193
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:41,962
 Very strong. 

194
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:47,641
 Why does not the world's most modern police know how to buy a certificate? 

195
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,889
 Or if we do not want to buy, let's encrypt. 

196
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,880
 Anything else would have saved us for free. 

197
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:55,952
 And the taxpayer would not pay a penny. 

198
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:59,729
 Following, this is the principle. 

199
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:06,175
 Erasing the fires that was generated by DROWN, POODLE and SLOTH. 

200
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:13,848
 Red 1, is an expression of the police to refer to the fire chief. 

201
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:15,276
 That's why we put it. 

202
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:24,457
 Well, they're really vulnerabilities of something that's a bad implementation. 

203
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:28,945
 Implemented without knowing. Implemented unwillingly. 

204
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,281
 Implemented by inexperienced people, or who do not follow the tutorial. 

205
00:14:35,234 --> 00:14:37,713
 The implementation of SSL is not rocket science. 

206
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:45,521
 The purpose of all these attacks, to summarize, 

207
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,329
 because we will not explore. 

208
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,400
 Is to abuse bad encryption to compromise 

209
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:59,265
 the communication channel and make a Man in The Middle to listen to the information. 

210
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:02,256
 What do we create for this? 

211
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:05,600
 Another new script in PowerShell. Because every audit 

212
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:10,121
 we have to give a sample, a pock called Lansky. 

213
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:17,628
 You see, I do not know if you can see. But four places are vulnerable. 

214
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:19,651
 It is detected automatically. 

215
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:25,660
 Of all the others. What is the reason that does not detect the other sites? 

216
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:28,243
 By the redirect they have in the middle. 

217
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,941
 There are so many redirects, DNS or Meta or whatever. 

218
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,012
 That does not allow the scanner to arrive and go to the next site. 

219
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,924
 That ends up never being able to scan all. 

220
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:47,050
 Well, the scanner that is passive, as I said we will not exploit vulnerabilities. 

221
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:51,843
 He said anyone could exploit a vulnerability in 2014, 

222
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,012
 2015, 2016. 

223
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:57,011
 But we're not talking about anything new. 

224
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:59,427
 It's something really troubling. 

225
00:16:00,563 --> 00:16:04,723
 Again, because the most modern police in the world who is Argentine. 

226
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,539
 Like everything good, you know. 

227
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:10,987
 It can not mitigate vulnerabilities from 3 years ago. 

228
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:12,995
 It is very simple. 

229
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:19,036
 Well, Misconfiguration in production. 

230
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:27,436
 This is something that does not really make a vulnerability, it is not a vulnerability in itself. 

231
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:38,500
 But it is a bad practice, and bad practices lead to conditions or situations 

232
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:42,315
 where an attack on a vulnerability could occur. 

233
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:51,720
 Let's take a look at some handy installation scripts, 

234
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:53,737
 WordPress Install, Drupal Install. 

235
00:16:56,681 --> 00:17:00,760
 Blog filters, people campaigning for devaluation 

236
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:04,873
 publishing confidential information, and it's been there for years. 

237
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
 You do not have a legal job, you do not have a judge's order. 

238
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,656
 There is nothing to eliminate them. 

239
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:16,991
 We even found an IDE, a JavaScript programming environment on one of the sites. 

240
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:22,232
 That entering allowed to edit everything. Including the directories. 

241
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:25,502
 We start with the simplest. 

242
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:31,912
 The police news site, which was in SSL bug if you remember. 

243
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,447
 Have a Drupal installation script the CRM they use. 

244
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,119
 Which by default appears in place of the index randomly. Random! 

245
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:51,008
 Someone enters the site, pop-up install. Automatically. 

246
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,368
 Nothing about Index, nothing. 

247
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,120
 Well, then anyone who joins here, 

248
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,504
 you can install your own website hosted and paid for by the police. 

249
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:05,760
 Your own paid CRM by the City Police. 

250
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:14,384
 This is proof of the pock concept of what happened. 

251
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:21,283
 The private security site we talked about during SSL. 

252
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:25,723
 It specifically has a situation that 

253
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,025
 existed before in public administration. 

254
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:34,905
 Everyone knows the state of directories or dirlisting 

255
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:38,634
 of Apache or NX, or any server. 

256
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,682
 Turning it on is often a bad practice. Sometimes it's a useful feature. 

257
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:50,793
 The situation that activating this feature demonstrated 

258
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:54,610
 that in production there was a directory that said IDEs. 

259
00:18:55,545 --> 00:19:01,707
 Entering, they have multiple instances of TinyMCE which is an IDE 

260
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:06,611
 Javascript that could change to edit server files. 

261
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:12,594
 Now we'll see the next image in detail. 

262
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:26,299
 See, tinymce.old, tinymce, all Javascripts, even are created by police. 

263
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,452
 Like for example JQuery 'Callejero' for example. 

264
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:34,621
 It has dates of paths traveled by patrolmen and patrols. 

265
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,230
 Paths through the streets. 

266
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,406
 On the other hand, have a blog ... 

267
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:44,830
 Today anyone has a blog and publish information, 

268
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,950
 but that has something in particular. 

269
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:54,525
 This unleashes a chain of very important security events. 

270
00:19:56,837 --> 00:20:00,410
 In a blog, a supposedly retired police officer, 

271
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,956
 expelled from the corporation. 

272
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,451
 Make a money laundering report. 

273
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,619
 Money laundering at the police. 

274
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:14,084
 And in a comment he gives cell numbers, 

275
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:21,593
 Nextel radios and even institutional e-mail accounts. 

276
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:28,511
 That is, boss accounts, officer accounts, manager accounts. 

277
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:34,614
 And the problem is, when someone starts scanning those accounts, 

278
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:37,182
 these accounts remain active, continue to use. 

279
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:44,144
 But the problem is, we were affected by several global leaks. 

280
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,391
 This is the site in question, it is still active. 

281
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:55,585
 It is believed to have existed for 5 or 6 years, I do not have the precise date. 

282
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,678
 Using the HavelBeenPwnd API, do you know? 

283
00:21:01,454 --> 00:21:06,758
 It's a really good site to see if your email account has been compromised. 

284
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:13,181
 We did bugsy, a little script what it does is get a list of accounts, 

285
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:18,238
 and verify where, when and in what service they were vulnerable. 

286
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:28,774
 As we can see, the first two were on the LinkedIn leak. 

287
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:37,140
 And the third one, do you know who it is? The third is the head of the City Police. 

288
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:44,249
 But you see, the city boss was not stolen by LinkedIn. 

289
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:46,360
 Stolen by DropBox. 

290
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:52,432
 A DropBox with files, which is not the same files I have. 

291
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:56,391
 That you have, or that you have a shared police chief. 

292
00:21:57,064 --> 00:22:02,832
 As we know, and as Luiz Tiago spoke well before, I am not mistaken. 

293
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:08,863
 That DropBox had the attack in 2012 and published it in 2016. 

294
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:17,704
 Pay attention to how long these files might have circled Darknet six or seven times. 

295
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:22,423
 That's what I was talking about. 

296
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:25,710
 Imagine this distance for a second. 

297
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:29,084
 Having a LinkedIn does not serve much. 

298
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,549
 Unless you have reused the password. 

299
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,252
 However, we began to search with Google's Dorking, 

300
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:43,164
 again open intelligence techniques, different directions, 

301
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:46,819
 because there we had the domains of those accounts. And we started looking for it. 

302
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:52,890
 Obviously we met other bosses, from different areas like the next gentleman. 

303
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:59,527
 There is an entire database, from microeletroniccash.com, 

304
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:02,415
 whole of 2014. 

305
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:08,742
 For an account that should not be registered on these sites. Because it's a work account. 

306
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:10,165
 It's a government bill. 

307
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:21,083
 But do not end here, what do you think would be a hacker's biggest goal in the police? 

308
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:24,795
 The goal that says, from here, I have everything? 

309
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,158
 It is not an Access Admin. 

310
00:23:27,477 --> 00:23:30,087
 It's the CIO itself. 

311
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:39,174
 As you can see, he was vulnerable by LinkedIn as well. 

312
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:45,451
 And this person, who will not show the files, reused the password on all services. 

313
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:52,195
 DropBox, Amazon, Azure, as you can see, is serious. 

314
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:57,163
 Or at least it's not something beautiful. 

315
00:23:58,286 --> 00:24:03,290
 Then again, why the most modern police in the world, whose is it? 

316
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:06,725
 Stronger, I feel lonely if not. 

317
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:10,794
 From Argentina, okay, it's the most modern police in the world. 

318
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:18,926
 Why do not you have a cyber-intelligence service like Amazon? 

319
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:23,558
 Amazon has a cyber-intelligence service to verify piracy. 

320
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,145
 Like many other sites. 

321
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:29,332
 Viacom has a dedicated cyber-intelligence service 

322
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,845
 specifically to look for pirated copies of their programs. 

323
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,237
 Inclusive in Youtube. 

324
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:39,613
 Why does not the police have a minimum of five or ten people? 

325
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,765
 That we did being 2 people. 

326
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:46,270
 To prevent, detect and mitigate such information leaks. 

327
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:53,365
 Forward, Web vulnerabilities, Leaks and something very new Cryptojacking. 

328
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:57,364
 That we include to work. A few months ago. 

329
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:05,431
 Some of the City Police websites in appearance are inherited from the Metropolitan Police. 

330
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:14,063
 The City Police gets the site, the HTML, strip the logo.png and put theirs. 

331
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:16,756
 Ready, implemented. 

332
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:19,347
 This is the new deploy of the City Police. 

333
00:25:20,748 --> 00:25:23,617
 Obviously every BackEnd is the same. 

334
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,312
 Exactly the same. 

335
00:25:25,896 --> 00:25:29,913
 The site has an important Crossing Script vulnerability. 

336
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:34,151
 Which we are going to explore now, obviously from the client side. 

337
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:38,831
 No site, none of the police have a captcha. 

338
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:43,854
 This is how we believe they used brute force 

339
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:46,915
 and took away the leaks that are now published. 

340
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:52,792
 A very particular Leak that we will see is, 

341
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:57,585
 the denunciation system of the city, where you can go and report 

342
00:25:57,785 --> 00:26:04,897
 drug trafficking, mistreatment of people, robberies, thefts, violence. 

343
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:10,730
 This database, with all the information of the person 

344
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:13,906
 which has been denounced and reported. 

345
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:17,958
 I'm saying, if you ever denounced a drug dealer, 

346
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:20,023
 the drug dealer now knows. 

347
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:22,836
 And you know who denounced it. 

348
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:29,220
 We start on day 1, the incorporation site is the same as the previous police. 

349
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:37,489
 Incorporations is the service in which a person registers to be a police officer. 

350
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,400
 That is, to go to the Police School. 

351
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,999
 Or where other officials register 

352
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,743
 to stop being officers of another force and to be of the police. 

353
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:51,832
 As we can see with Wayback Machine, the site is the same. 

354
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:59,726
 And in them there is an error, XSS that exists 8 years ago. 

355
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:01,320
 Even to this day. 

356
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:06,901
 To exploit the vulnerability three applications were made. 

357
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:09,416
 We had plenty of free time. 

358
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:18,514
 Dillinger allows to put a link in a Javascript that you want, 

359
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:21,506
 either a Cryptominer or a Beef instance. 

360
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:23,043
 Your own Javascript. 

361
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:27,567
 Including an IDE. Remember Tinymce, the previous IDE. 

362
00:27:27,782 --> 00:27:30,381
 Even an IDE can link there. 

363
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:35,966
 Automatically the site begins to serve what you put. 

364
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:38,275
 Simple example. 

365
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:40,801
 A fake coinhive script. 

366
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:45,401
 Coinhive.com my_js_miner played ktor 

367
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:47,257
 Obviously it's not real. 

368
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,817
 I want you to pay attention also to the second one we carry, 

369
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:57,817
 malicioso.com/beef, an instance of Beef Framework, know? 

370
00:27:58,089 --> 00:27:59,337
 Did you work with Beef? 

371
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:03,647
 This is the source code. 

372
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,789
 Look, it was automatically loaded. 

373
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:08,981
 Automatically reflected. 

374
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,378
 They can carry scripts inside the police. 

375
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:19,770
 You can have the whole City Police start mining cryptomoeda for you. 

376
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:24,729
 In just five minutes. Or less. 

377
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:27,288
 Whatever, to do that. 

378
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:33,104
 Dallas is different, it allows you to directly write sentences in Javascript. 

379
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,679
 From an alert, to more complex modifications. 

380
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,655
 It's exactly the same principle. 

381
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:47,303
 Example: What this script does, is to choose all Tags A 

382
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:56,228
 change the HREF to send it to malicious.com/trojan.exe. 

383
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,629
 Why are you talking about Chaves? 

384
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:06,087
 It came down from the sky. 

385
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:12,575
 We came back again. 

386
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,997
 We can change all hyperlinks. 

387
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:23,920
 All links, any way we want. 

388
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:32,033
 For example, to roadsec.com/trojan.zip, trojan.exe, trojan.cmd. 

389
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:37,806
 For the older .com. If you remember. 

390
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,503
 Besides, I want you to see one thing. 

391
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:48,983
 Particularly ... yes, here! 

392
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:56,962
 Can you see? If you can see, XSS works. 

393
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:58,745
 But shoot that. 

394
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:01,386
 That means? 

395
00:30:01,706 --> 00:30:05,745
 What a SQL injection, a SQL injection is possible. 

396
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,606
 But let's not explore. 

397
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:12,376
 Since it is an active procedure, and this is passive. 

398
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:17,221
 Who had the most modern police in the world? 

399
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,268
 Forgot it. 

400
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,837
 They no longer say so convinced. Already doubts. 

401
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:27,700
 Colombia. 

402
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:31,540
 Leeches, leeches. 

403
00:30:31,884 --> 00:30:37,077
 It is a framework that has a user interface, yet easier to explore. 

404
00:30:37,428 --> 00:30:42,085
 Look! Same situation. 

405
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:48,364
 We did not put anything else, the vulnerable URL, 

406
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:52,037
 the Post is how the URL closes. 

407
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:56,508
 And the malicious URL, for example, 'I love Roadsec'. 

408
00:30:57,069 --> 00:31:00,261
 Messages, modify all links, redirect, 

409
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:04,525
 steal cookies and even crash the browser by consuming memory. 

410
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:08,261
 You can even add more injections like cryptominers. 

411
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:13,436
 No site of the institution has any mechanism of control. 

412
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:18,269
 It's called captcha or something like anti-DDoS like that of Cloudflare. 

413
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:20,533
 Know Cloudflare? Good. 

414
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:25,605
 This can serve anything, to make brute force, 

415
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:28,892
 which is the way we think they stole the credentials. 

416
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:31,805
 Or denial of service. 

417
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,221
 No captcha, no captcha, no captcha. 

418
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:42,820
 There are more but we will show three only. 

419
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,270
 Because most modern police have three vulnerabilities, nothing more. 

420
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:52,759
 Well, using the Pastebin API, do you know Pastebin? 

421
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,686
 Did they steal things from Pastebin? 

422
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:57,734
 Did you see leaks in Pastebin? Not very well. 

423
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:05,272
 Also using Google's IRC and Dorking data we find different police leaks. 

424
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:11,466
 In the mergers, do you remember that I commented that it had a gigantic XSS? 

425
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:17,250
 The passwords were in MD5, no salt, no pepper, 

426
00:32:17,442 --> 00:32:20,965
 In fact they are highly conditioning hashs. 

427
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:30,872
 Have all the information, listen, of all the police officers, clinical information, professional, 

428
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:35,240
 personal data, psychological and psychiatric information, 

429
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:41,280
 including personal data such as the workers' religion. 

430
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:51,432
 This SSVCS is an undersecretary of citizen liaison with security. An invention. 

431
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:57,844
 This system had denunciations, which we commented recently. 

432
00:32:58,115 --> 00:33:02,856
 Different accusations of drug trafficking, ill-treatment of people and more. 

433
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:15,897
 This database was published, and the passwords were in plain text, more than 50% of the passwords are 123456. 

434
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:18,773
 The worst password in the world. 

435
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:26,861
 These are the MD5 incorporations. 

436
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:30,949
 If you see, that hash repeats itself. 

437
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,967
 Database of police reports. 

438
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:47,937
 Chief of Staff, Undersecretary, Director General of primary containment of citizenship of crimes. 

439
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:53,072
 123456, 123456, 123456. 

440
00:33:53,281 --> 00:34:04,113
 Mouth! 123456, 2005 this one took the prize. 1234. 

441
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:10,313
 If others put 123456, it does not matter. 

442
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:14,245
 We have several points of error. 

443
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:16,761
 Simple password, there is no password policy, 

444
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,897
 a password complexity policy. 

445
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,257
 Hash fragile, or nonexistent. 

446
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:33,804
 MD5 in 2018, we have all the information that is associated that gives us more information behind. 

447
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:36,253
 Because these people reuse those passwords. 

448
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:42,371
 Hacking this, we have access to medical, psychological, labor, 

449
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:48,108
 religious service and individuals who rely on government. 

450
00:34:48,476 --> 00:34:52,157
 Of any citizen who trusts to report a criminal, 

451
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,964
 finds its information exposed to the criminal. 

452
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:58,372
 This is the problem we must change. 

453
00:34:59,904 --> 00:35:06,262
 Then the most modern police in the world no longer the most modern ... 

454
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:11,744
 There were no internal audits. Quality control. 

455
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:15,392
 That they control that a vulnerability does not exist for eight years. 

456
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,263
 Eight years! Vulnerable! 

457
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:26,077
 To close a little, when a firewall catches fire. 

458
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:28,046
 This is something unique in history. 

459
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:35,246
 Finally pinging the sites, we realized that 

460
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:43,734
 a good amount responded to a public .2 and .3 IP that were firewalls. 

461
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:46,220
 The border firefighters. 

462
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:54,640
 The firewall is a Sophos firewall. There we already have two main problems with Sophos. 

463
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,991
 With this particular model. 

464
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:02,124
 Sophos accesses do not require captcha. 

465
00:36:02,404 --> 00:36:10,260
 Mostly the SG series below have no control mechanism against a brute force. 

466
00:36:10,524 --> 00:36:15,859
 And on the other hand, the Sophos API, which we also used 

467
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:21,765
 was questioned for using MD4 as a safety method. 

468
00:36:22,085 --> 00:36:26,789
 A hash that was broken 11 years ago. 2007. 

469
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:30,028
 MD4 can not be used for anything. 

470
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:33,707
 Not even for a safety test. Because it is obsolete. 

471
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:37,012
 And finally, guess what happened. 

472
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:40,285
 The certificate is also invalid. 

473
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,559
 Captcha, without captcha. 

474
00:36:45,655 --> 00:36:49,679
 And clearly public management. 

475
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:56,263
 Finally with the OSINT subject of open source intelligence. 

476
00:36:56,462 --> 00:36:59,095
 We use the API, I Know what you Download. 

477
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:07,039
 Have you ever used it? It is a very good Russian site, which has trackers of spy torrents. 

478
00:37:07,437 --> 00:37:12,397
 Who make notes of what you downloaded, and publish on the internet. 

479
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:14,534
 With your public address. 

480
00:37:15,373 --> 00:37:24,196
 We thought, what would happen if we put in this API the IP and the Gateway of the police. 

481
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,286
 And they do not know what happened. 

482
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:31,188
 Police are also complicit in the federal hacking offense. 

483
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,229
 The best police in the world. 

484
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:42,520
 American Assassin, Battle of the Sexes, Beyond Skyline, Z. 

485
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,128
 As you can see, the gateway was .2. 

486
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:54,032
 One second. .2 and .3 is their gateway. 

487
00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:59,456
 Totally accessible, it can 'ping', you can ping now, it's connected. 

488
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:05,936
 And that has no date, but it's recent. From January, February. 

489
00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:13,438
 So! Why the world's most modern police do not have a 

490
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:20,790
 control of your network traffic, nor security implements that put firewall, etc? 

491
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,943
 Because? 

492
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:29,951
 Our final conclusions are to close and talk a little and answer questions. 

493
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:37,734
 Our objective was to demonstrate technique and above all objectively without opinions, 

494
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:42,519
 if not with something technical and solid that we do not have the most modern police in the world. 

495
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:44,921
 This is demonstrated, it seems. 

496
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:51,937
 Second, we believe that the City, Federal and Provincial Police, 

497
00:38:53,337 --> 00:38:59,057
 have a lot of work to do to make computer security serious. 

498
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:04,490
 To be really executed by people who know, 

499
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:08,065
 by people who really want to improve the system. 

500
00:39:10,707 --> 00:39:13,788
 The idea is that in the future, the police will open, 

501
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:18,925
 and have the possibility to work with hackers, with programmers, 

502
00:39:19,165 --> 00:39:22,253
 with all kinds of people, including DBAs. 

503
00:39:22,677 --> 00:39:28,462
 What do you imagine, that can make open competitions so that 

504
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:32,349
 people can cooperate, get close, can say that this is bad. 

505
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:35,133
 And do not get arrested for it. 

506
00:39:36,397 --> 00:39:42,431
 A very representative case. Which reminds me a lot of Diego Aranha's conference. 

507
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:48,716
 When we made the electronic ballot system in Argentina. 

508
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:53,515
 A group finds a source code in GitHub. 

509
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:57,907
 All the source code of the electronic urn in Python. 

510
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:02,484
 They begin to test and first warn the government, 

511
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,420
 this GitHub we found. 

512
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:09,549
 This is productive, the government said: No. It is not productive. 

513
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,558
 It is not productive but we find vulnerabilities. 

514
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:19,574
 And these people were arrested, for doing something that was public. 

515
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:24,935
 GitHub was public, the code was in public, and they were arrested. 

516
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,806
 The idea is that this does not happen. 

517
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:32,039
 The idea is to have cooperation so that cases like what we have seen now 

518
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:37,022
 does not happen every day and does not last for eight years. 

519
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:41,767
 As happened with the XSS of the site of incorporation. 

520
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:49,037
 It will take a second, I want to thank the staff of Eldritch SEC a lot. 

521
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:50,852
 Who are my best friends. 

522
00:40:51,061 --> 00:40:55,037
 Every Production Ministry, because it's been days since I've been gone. 

523
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:59,710
 My girlfriend. And all Brazil, thank you very much for receiving me.
