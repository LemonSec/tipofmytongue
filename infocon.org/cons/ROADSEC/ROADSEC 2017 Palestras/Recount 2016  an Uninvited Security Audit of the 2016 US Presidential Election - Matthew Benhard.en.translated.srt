1
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:19,469
 Hello, I'm Matt, sorry but I lack Portuguese. Then this talk will be in English. 

2
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:24,556
 As you listened to I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan. 

3
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:25,645
 I'm advised by Alex Halderman. 

4
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,833
 And I'm here to talk about our experience last year 

5
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:33,508
 with the United States Presidential Election 2016. On the Recount screen. 

6
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:38,635
 So to understand, let's refresh your memory a little bit. 

7
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,818
 Last year we had an election between these two candidates. 

8
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,626
 We had Donald Trump on the left and Hillary Clinton on the right. 

9
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:48,562
 And I assure you all now what happened. 

10
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:53,780
 Donald Trump won the election. But it was not always so obvious. 

11
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:58,549
 Going beyond the election, many people expected Hillary Clinton to win. 

12
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,324
 This is FiveThirtyEight which is a well-known Election Blog in the United States. 

13
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:08,286
 It aggregates and predicts elections and gives you an idea of ​​what they look like. 

14
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:14,293
 In the last two elections, 2008 and 2012 they designed almost all states correctly. 

15
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,910
 So they're pretty accurate. 

16
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:20,772
 As we can see here, they are giving a 71 percent chance of winning. 

17
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,545
 And they were not alone in it. 

18
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,999
 You have the New York Times, giving Hillary 85 percent. 

19
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:33,583
 You have the Princeton Election Consortium which is basically this Sam Wang guy. 

20
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:37,695
 That gave Hillary a 99 percent chance of winning. 

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,157
 And Sam was so confident, he said: If Trump wins more than 240 votes he would eat an insect. 

22
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:49,301
 So, in general the feeling was that Hillary was going to win this race. 

23
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,502
 As you can see, virtually every newspaper we know of was mentioning it. 

24
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,390
 Of course we know that was not all that happened. 

25
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:04,461
 What really happened was that. (Political specialist eats insect as promised) 

26
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:10,436
 What really surprises everyone including someone who swallowed an insect on national network. 

27
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:13,506
 Trump won! 

28
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:20,037
 So these are the results in fact, as you can see Donald Trump won the electoral votes. 

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,788
 In a second I explain what the electoral votes are. So do not worry about it. 

30
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:27,485
 But in addition, Hillary Clinton won in popular vote. She won. 

31
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:31,676
 The margin was 3 million more votes for Clinton than Trump. 

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,365
 Where we have this crazy system, it can happen that everyone votes 

33
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:37,156
 in one candidate but the other candidate still wins. 

34
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:44,644
 And this is a fierce race. Despite what Trump kept talking after being elected. 

35
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:51,404
 His electoral victory was not really the best. 

36
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:56,396
 In fact, he is the 46th ranked ranking of all elected presidents we have ever had. 

37
00:02:57,234 --> 00:03:00,742
 So this was a tight race with unexpected results. 

38
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:08,084
 So what happened? Even if you have a systematically misspelled explanation, 

39
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:11,276
 That would be the ones that spin FiveThirtyEight. 

40
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,716
 And someone claimed that the score margins and counting scores were wrong. 

41
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:21,220
 Or the election system was hacked. 

42
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:28,732
 This seems to be the theory that Trump continued to speak to the world. 

43
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:35,332
 You know, the election was manipulated, the results of the election were not valid. 

44
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:38,514
 So, we know, if it is probably doubtful, 

45
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,643
 it seems reasonable that once or twice the counts were wrong. 

46
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:43,954
 So, what is happening? 

47
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:48,957
 What does Donald Trump claim is really doable? 

48
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,213
 Is at least possible? 

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,752
 And if so, how do we find out if we do? 

50
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:56,184
 So that's what we wanted to do. About a year or so ago. 

51
00:03:57,814 --> 00:04:02,262
 To summarize the overview of the American elections and why all this is so crazy. 

52
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,565
 First we have a massive scale, here in Brazil it is a big country. 

53
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:13,638
 So you understand, and our elections are very confusing as in Brazil. 

54
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:22,220
 Then every state, county, small town they will decide how they are going to vote. 

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,939
 These elections are really complex. With long votes from many categories. 

56
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:30,835
 There is always the sense of waiting that we need to score on the night of the election. 

57
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,772
 And again some statistics for you. 

58
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:37,202
 Here we have 200 million registered votes. 

59
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:41,514
 187 thousand points of elections. 

60
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,228
 And 52 types of electronic ballot boxes. 

61
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:47,522
 Unlike Brazil that only has one, we have many types. 

62
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:53,369
 This is the US map, including technology using technology in the 2016 vote. 

63
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:57,289
 And you can see here, we have basically all the 

64
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:00,241
 possibilities of combination technology you can imagine. 

65
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:05,852
 We have in the Pacific Northwest the postal vote in Georgia and South Carolina 

66
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:09,674
 we have DRE and paper, the same that they use in Brazil. 

67
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:15,697
 In states like Michigan and New York it's just vote to paper. They use bar code. 

68
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:22,688
 And places like Nevada, Texas, Florida or Tennesse there are mixtures of these things. 

69
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,803
 Again, to show the complexity here. 

70
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:29,427
 This is a US state. And these are the different counties of that state. 

71
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:33,396
 And you can see that even counties do not agree on the technology they will use. 

72
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:37,812
 Some will use DRE, others will use paper, and others will post. 

73
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:42,140
 The point here is that the election technology is very diverse, very complex. 

74
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:46,499
 So I mentioned that our ballot is very complex. 

75
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:50,282
 This is a ballot from the city of Dallas, Texas last year. 

76
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,275
 And as you can see, it has a lot of text. 

77
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,771
 You have to read it all before you get down here. 

78
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:55,947
 Where you can vote for someone. 

79
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:59,260
 And you can imagine that this is exhausting for the voter. 

80
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:04,332
 But that's just page 1, and you can see all the competitors here. 

81
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:09,715
 And it has 8 pages like that, so it's incredibly complicated, 

82
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:10,964
 for anyone to vote for. 

83
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,303
 If the technology changed one of these pages or these candidates 

84
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,575
 the voter would not notice it. 

85
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:23,471
 As we mentioned, we have many types of electronic ballot boxes. 

86
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,248
 But they really fit into two types of categories. 

87
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:30,567
 You have the barcode, where you place your information on a ballot. 

88
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:33,030
 As it appears here. And you put it in a reader. 

89
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:34,911
 Sometimes it is counted manually. 

90
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:38,798
 And then we have the DRE, which is what you are accustomed to in Brazil. 

91
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:42,656
 And sometimes they produce paper registration, sometimes not. 

92
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:50,541
 This is an example of a DRE that is used in the United States. This is Diebold Accuvote-TS. 

93
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:56,012
 It began to be used in 2003 and is still used in the state of Georgia in the USA. 

94
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:59,477
 My mentor when he was a graduate student, ten years ago. 

95
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:04,926
 He picked up one of these urns and dismounted, and checked how vulnerable he was. 

96
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,681
 How safe was the system. 

97
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:12,137
 Then they dismounted the urn to open, looked at the motherboard, 

98
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:16,457
 you know, there are EEPROM chips and several other sources within that. 

99
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:20,385
 And what discovered that these machines were not safe at all. 

100
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:23,593
 They repeated the same encryption key, they invaded the entire urn. 

101
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:28,881
 The way I started and ran any program they put. 

102
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,474
 Then they realized that these urns are 

103
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:36,450
 these memory cards that are inserted. 

104
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,618
 So if you put a virus or something on the memory card. 

105
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:42,778
 And putting it in the urn, the urn becomes infected with the virus. 

106
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:47,385
 And what's more, you get another memory card that has not been infected. 

107
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,498
 And you connect to this urn, it also gets infected with the virus. 

108
00:07:50,697 --> 00:07:54,689
 So you can spread a virus in many electronic ballot boxes. 

109
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:56,834
 All without being connected to the internet. 

110
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:01,610
 To give you an idea about this virus it seems. 

111
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:06,025
 Here you see, two choices on a ballot. 

112
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:10,673
 Where you have the obvious vote in red for George Washington upon. 

113
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,441
 And not for Benedict Arnold. 

114
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,647
 But what this virus does is fool the urn you voted for George Washington 

115
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:24,248
 But then at the end of the election you clearly see that Benedict Arnold won. 

116
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:28,924
 And this is a vote where all votes went to George Washington 

117
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:35,332
 This malware is so easy to build that you even have time to create a user interface. 

118
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,684
 It's not really difficult. As you can see here, it has a scale bar. 

119
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:42,164
 Where you can choose what percentage your candidate will win. 

120
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:45,221
 This shows how much these urns are unsafe. 

121
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:51,151
 But this is just an electronic ballot box. What about the other urns? 

122
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:53,111
 I said we used 52 and just talked about one. 

123
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:56,119
 Each of the electronic ballot boxes, which have already been 

124
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:59,415
 Studied were considered vulnerable. 

125
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:06,615
 You have the DREs of that type. The Accuvote TSX was the successor to the Accuvote TS. 

126
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:11,967
 You have the Sequoia AVC Edge. That's really easy to break that's for playing Pac-Man. 

127
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:13,655
 That you can see here. 

128
00:09:13,855 --> 00:09:17,583
 You have these barcode readers. Which were also broken earlier. 

129
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,679
 So certainly none of our urns that have been studied are actually safe. 

130
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:29,231
 And like I said, each of those that have been seen are incredibly vulnerable. 

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,552
 So, can you hack an election? 

132
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,479
 We have these vulnerable electronic ballot boxes, but you know, we have several types. 

133
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,376
 Counties, cities and states have different technologies. 

134
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,680
 And it may not be feasible to steal votes when it has a consequence. 

135
00:09:46,523 --> 00:09:49,151
 You usually have these 3 types of scenarios if you want 

136
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,055
 hack an election. 

137
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:56,822
 First being someone who changes the election results unnoticed, something that no one understands. 

138
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,981
 Or else that way you can undermine the credibility of the election. 

139
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,484
 Obviously when something goes wrong. 

140
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:07,175
 You can deny services, you can create long queues to vote, you can turn off machines, 

141
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:09,031
 you can turn off the electricity. 

142
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,144
 You can do many different things to interfere in the elections. 

143
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:15,483
 And you can also cause political interference. 

144
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,336
 If you are a formal government, you can create a 

145
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:23,526
 misinformation about one of the candidates to discredit him. 

146
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:30,908
 The scary thing about all of this is that we have seen this happen in reality in 2014 in Ukraine. 

147
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,115
 Russia has modified, altered the electoral result and also inactivated the counting system. 

148
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:44,557
 And you should know, in 2016, Russia was in a disinformation campaign against Hillary Clinton. 

149
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,276
 So these 3 hacker scenarios happened. 

150
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,748
 Some of them in the elections we are seeing now. 

151
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,892
 But let's say you want to change your vote. 

152
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:55,725
 How will you do that? 

153
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:58,540
 We have three major challenges here. 

154
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:04,562
 First as I mentioned, it's the different technologies, the machines are not connected to the internet. 

155
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:08,753
 And 70 percent of US citizens use some paper record. 

156
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:11,423
 In case something goes wrong with electronic ballot boxes and counting. 

157
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:12,680
 And check everything over again. 

158
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:19,631
 So they look like tough challenges. How do we overcome them? 

159
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:25,775
 Well looking at the first challenge, as I mentioned we have this crazy electoral system in the United States. 

160
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,259
 Called Electoral College. 

161
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:34,603
 And the way it works, in every state who wins the majority of votes wins the 'electoral vote'. 

162
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:38,547
 With a few exceptions, I think Nebraska has a bigger representation. 

163
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:41,700
 Then for information Donald Trump won in Texas. 

164
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,227
 He won all 38 electoral votes. 

165
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:49,531
 And the winner is declared by whoever manages to win 270 electoral votes first. 

166
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:55,172
 As you can see here in this count, Donald Trump had 360 electoral votes. 

167
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,332
 Which was enough to win. 

168
00:11:57,119 --> 00:12:01,745
 But the thing about it, is that states have locks. 

169
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,488
 You do not need to change status to see the result. 

170
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:09,205
 When you see one of these two or three states here, suddenly you 

171
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:12,203
 has 40 electoral votes between Trump and Clinton or vice versa. 

172
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:16,164
 So you really only have to affect 1 percent of the votes. 

173
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:19,654
 And this is especially convenient when states have a tight margin. 

174
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:22,046
 I'll talk about the states later, and what they did. 

175
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:25,276
 But New Hampshire's margin was 0.3 percent. 

176
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:28,294
 So you just have to invert a few thousand votes there. 

177
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:34,390
 So the first challenge does not seem to be a big obstacle for a motivated opponent. 

178
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:36,957
 How about the fact that the polls are not connected to the internet? 

179
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,174
 As I mentioned, we already know that we can build a virus and 

180
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:43,558
 spread through electronic ballot boxes. 

181
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:48,049
 And the other thing to know is that when you program an electronic ballot box, 

182
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:51,847
 it is normal for them to use central computers like this. 

183
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,854
 Just in any office, and often that computer is connected to the internet. 

184
00:12:57,331 --> 00:13:02,635
 So if you infect this computer, you can actually infect every 

185
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,387
 go on that computer and then on the electronic ballot boxes. And effectively the election itself. 

186
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:12,666
 But you know, this scenario is exactly as it would be. And it really is what it is. 

187
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:18,308
 In the US in many states we have many outsourced companies 

188
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:20,098
 this is government business solutions. 

189
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:27,498
 They want to program all electronic ballot boxes in a county, city or state. 

190
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:32,827
 For example in the state of Michigan, three quarters of the electronic ballot boxes 

191
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:35,355
 are programmed by one of the two of these small businesses. 

192
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:37,931
 Small means, they hire 20 people. 

193
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:40,146
 So, what do you want to do here. 

194
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:44,323
 Governmental Business Solution has a good website. 

195
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:48,570
 It does not have TLS-R, unfortunately. But there are pictures of their stock, 

196
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:51,372
 You can go in and hack into their system. 

197
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:55,715
 They have email from all employees so you can make a phishing attack. 

198
00:13:57,091 --> 00:14:02,130
 So in principle it would not be so difficult to put a virus on the network of these companies. 

199
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,372
 And then spread by electronic ballot boxes, 

200
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,179
 to electronic ballot boxes that are not connected to the internet. 

201
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:09,679
 But what about this third challenge here? 

202
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,408
 This one seems more doubtful. 

203
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:13,209
 You can not exactly hack paper. 

204
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:17,713
 It is not that you will persuade the state to stop using paper if you are an opponent. 

205
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:25,256
 So, what you do? The idea behind the paper is to give you a physical note of something earlier. 

206
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:32,473
 And a kind of metaphor is that in airplanes they use physical compasses in case the equipment fails. 

207
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:35,489
 And that's the point of the paper, the paper ballots are good, 

208
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:39,585
 even if computers confuse ballots, you can still recount 

209
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,334
 where you can see the physical paper ballot, you can find out what the voters 

210
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:43,760
 really want it to happen. 

211
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,939
 But the problem with paper is that it is very slow, 

212
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:49,491
 and too expensive to work, need many people, 

213
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:51,915
 it takes a lot of time to count each ballot by hand, 

214
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:55,131
 But computers are pretty good at it. 

215
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:58,571
 But the good thing about the role as I mentioned, are checked by the voter. 

216
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:04,474
 The voter marks this ballot. The voter does not dribble a count on that memory card. 

217
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,995
 Or the voter has no way of knowing how they do it. 

218
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:10,987
 So paper cells are very expensive, but better in safety. 

219
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:16,204
 While the memory card are fast and cheap but are not reliable at all. 

220
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:21,531
 So focus here, you can see some papers to indicate if the value 

221
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,091
 that is on the memory card is actually correct. 

222
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:29,319
 And to give you an idea, as I mentioned 70 percent 

223
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,351
 of the United States has some form of paper registration of their votes. 

224
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:34,888
 And that number is currently growing in the state of Virginia. 

225
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:38,728
 Just because the government got rid of all paperless electronic ballot boxes. 

226
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:41,762
 So as you can see, many places have that role. 

227
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:46,205
 So if they used it correctly, their attack would be picked up immediately. 

228
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,861
 But unfortunately, no state looks at the paper. 

229
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:51,951
 Only a few states look at the election balance. 

230
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:55,037
 We basically get all this expensive paper, we cut all those trees. 

231
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,404
 We print all these bills, and they all go to waste. 

232
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,441
 Once the election is over. 

233
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:02,386
 So, sure, hacking a really much easier election 

234
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:03,231
 of what you thought. 

235
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,422
 Than we think. Than the people who come 

236
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,488
 working in those 20 years they think. 

237
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,770
 First, all you have to do is use the previous elections 

238
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:11,882
 to find some states with similar margins. 

239
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,185
 So you look at one of these ballot program companies in these states. 

240
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:17,617
 And it spreads a virus to the electronic ballot boxes. 

241
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:23,593
 This virus is placed in electronic voting machines, and dribbles a small number of votes 

242
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,720
 which will not be detectable. 

243
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,758
 And states throw out the only way to detect the attacks. 

244
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:29,630
 Easy right? 

245
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:35,070
 So, knowing that. That was what we had to say. 

246
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:37,816
 We knew that our electoral system was incredibly vulnerable. 

247
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:41,645
 We knew that the hacker scenario was plausible 

248
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:45,380
 that we had already seen other opposing nations active in that election. 

249
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:49,596
 So what we wanted to do was some kind of auditing in the 2016 election. 

250
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,668
 But how would we do that? 

251
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:56,459
 In the United States we have five weeks after the election 

252
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:59,347
 so that the results can be confirmed at the electoral college. 

253
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,060
 So you only have 5 weeks window if you want to change anything. 

254
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:08,595
 As I mentioned the presidential race was extremely fierce 

255
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:11,132
 and with a challenging score. 

256
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:13,692
 We also saw Russia acting in bad faith in these elections. 

257
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:17,316
 And we have already shown that it is feasible to infect 

258
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:18,817
 enough to affect the consequences. 

259
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:22,156
 But even under these circumstances, no state was willing 

260
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:23,944
 to take a second look at your votes, 

261
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:27,458
 and check if what the electronic ballots said was correct. 

262
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:31,033
 As I mentioned, we only have five weeks as a limited time. 

263
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:35,657
 And you know, the two questions we started to ask were: 

264
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:36,801
 Is this possible? 

265
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:39,016
 Or at least we can prove this consequence 

266
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,159
 with the evidence we obtained in such a short time? 

267
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:48,109
 Alex and myself, and other electoral intellectuals gathered 

268
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,992
 and we try to think about it. 

269
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:51,937
 And I watch over the next slides. 

270
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,516
 Which are several photos of my advisor. Originally this conversation was 

271
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:55,973
 nice conversation with him. 

272
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,701
 So if you look a lot at his face, that's why. 

273
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:00,293
 So what happened in the result? 

274
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:05,186
 So one week after the election, Alex and I went to a conference 

275
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:07,506
 in Los Angeles, we were flying back to Michigan. 

276
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:09,545
 And Alex got that call on the plane. 

277
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:14,341
 And honest voters say. 

278
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:17,141
 What is the evidence of fraud? 

279
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:18,566
 How do we pay for the recount? 

280
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:23,295
 Sorry, I should mention the call was from Hillary Clinton's campaign. 

281
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:26,861
 The Clinton campaign was trying to figure out how to 

282
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:28,782
 they really missed that election. 

283
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:30,276
 Was it the evidence of fraud? 

284
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:34,629
 How was it? How do we detect it? Can we pay for recounting? 

285
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,798
 The scary part of the Clinton campaign 

286
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:41,348
 is that she considered herself victorious. She had already lost. 

287
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:42,771
 Since saying I missed it. 

288
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:44,669
 Donald Trump is the president. 

289
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:48,780
 So if she starts asking for a recount, that's bad. 

290
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:52,995
 So to hammer on that point, in the debates during the election, 

291
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:58,348
 Hillary ... there was this moment where the moderator asked Donald Trump 

292
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:01,881
 if you lost the election, would you accept the results? 

293
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:05,648
 And Donald Trump did not answer. He just nodded and kept going. 

294
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:10,712
 Hillary Clinton in response said: He is indirectly saying he would not admit it. 

295
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:14,815
 He said something horrible ... a direct threat to our democracy. 

296
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:19,871
 So Hillary Clinton was hopeless and could not ask for a recount 

297
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:23,265
 after this exchange and say that no one can see that the 

298
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:25,195
 election is a threat to America's democracy. 

299
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:28,480
 So the Clinton campaign basically continued. 

300
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,154
 We feel a little hopeful here, because the only way 

301
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:34,650
 that we could see these roles would be by a recount. 

302
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,098
 And the only way to get a recount was 

303
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:39,619
 using some candidate who was in the presidential race. 

304
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:44,713
 Then a week later, Alex was sitting in his office, 

305
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:47,114
 and another connection. And it's Jill Stein. 

306
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:53,749
 Jill Stein, is the Green Party presidential candidate in the United States. 

307
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:57,706
 The Green Party is a small party. 

308
00:19:57,706 --> 00:20:02,831
 Pretty small, it only got 1 percent of the vote in 2016. 

309
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:06,227
 But they have the history of being the most upright in the election. 

310
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:09,400
 So it was very good, it was on the ballots of most states. 

311
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,883
 Especially states that we care about. 

312
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:14,787
 Giving her a record of election integrity. 

313
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:19,261
 Then it is possible that he will collect the ballots and recount them. 

314
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,896
 And so it was done. 

315
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:25,113
 Unfortunately mixed in all this. 

316
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:29,289
 Someone from the Clinton campaign told the press that we were 

317
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:32,397
 working trying to prove that something was wrong. 

318
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:35,854
 Unfortunately according to Alex, they were saying 

319
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:39,413
 that there is persuasive evidence that the election was hacked. 

320
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:42,792
 And up to that point we did not know anything. We only knew what we wanted to see. 

321
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,745
 This basically ruined our holiday. 

322
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:50,406
 We had to write a response until five in the morning. 

323
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:55,028
 Here in Medium, I still think it's open and you can read it if you want. 

324
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:56,185
 But basically we were claiming that 

325
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:59,025
 we did not know whether the election had been hacked or not. 

326
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:04,105
 But the only way to say yes or no is if we look at the final balance sheet on paper. 

327
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:09,072
 And at that point, it became international news. It was a big deal. 

328
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:13,248
 And finally the Green Party turned into solution. 

329
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,666
 What they were going to do was raise funds 

330
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:19,134
 and try to find states that accept money and organize. 

331
00:21:19,806 --> 00:21:23,206
 Like lawyers and volunteers to recount the ballots. 

332
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:27,158
 I should mention that Jill Stein raised $ 5 million in two days. 

333
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:32,231
 Jill Stein never raised $ 5 million in her entire political career. 

334
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:34,405
 So that was a big deal. 

335
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:37,627
 We had 160,000 donors in the United States. 

336
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:40,305
 Requesting the start of a security audit. 

337
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,010
 This was really supported. 

338
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:44,049
 So what did we do? 

339
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,395
 We had that money, we had the candidate, 

340
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:48,532
 we thought we could continue with this. 

341
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:51,223
 The next question is, what votes will we retell? 

342
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:55,375
 It seems a bit difficult to recount the whole country. Since there are 2 million valid votes. 

343
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:58,431
 Maybe it can be done in some states. 

344
00:21:58,726 --> 00:22:02,102
 And in the states we decided to go to, they were Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. 

345
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:08,351
 The reason for this, all three had projected Clinton to be victorious. 

346
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,198
 And in fact I believe the three are democratic states for more than 40 years. 

347
00:22:12,327 --> 00:22:16,286
 Together they have 46 electoral votes, which is enough to change the victory. 

348
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:21,198
 And all three ... you must forgive my slides, it was done on GoogleDrive. 

349
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,751
 You are running in PowerPoint. 

350
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:25,917
 All three have margins less than 0.8 percent. 

351
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:28,159
 So they were all very fierce elections. 

352
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,627
 Altogether decided by just over 78,000 votes in a few million. 

353
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:40,798
 In addition, Michigan and Wisconsin allow applicants to apply for recount 

354
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:43,537
 In Pennsylvania, unfortunately, he needs a court order. 

355
00:22:43,537 --> 00:22:48,169
 It's a bit more complicated. You need three inhabitants with your records and pay a fee. 

356
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:49,614
 I'll talk a little bit more about it. 

357
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:53,927
 So looking at the state of Wisconsin they have 10 electoral votes. 

358
00:22:54,758 --> 00:22:57,727
 The margin there is 22 thousand, almost 23 thousand votes. 

359
00:22:58,758 --> 00:23:01,647
 The technology was almost all barcode. 

360
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,295
 So all the votes had a paper record. 

361
00:23:04,623 --> 00:23:08,263
 In any candidate can request the count if he pays the cost. 

362
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:11,150
 Luckily we have a candidate who now has enough money to pay for it. 

363
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:17,222
 The bad part of this is that every county in Wisconsin decides how they recount. 

364
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:21,447
 Since they call volunteers to recount each record by hand. 

365
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:24,455
 Or maybe they can pick up the records and put them back on the machines. 

366
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:26,695
 And try to find out whether they were hacked or not. 

367
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:30,087
 The state of Michigan was even tougher. 

368
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,757
 It was one of the hottest states in 2016. 

369
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:36,321
 A margin of only 11,000 votes. 0.23 percent. 

370
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:39,241
 Their technology was totally bar code. 

371
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:41,649
 Then all voters had a paper register marked by the voter himself. 

372
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,929
 And there is a law in Michigan that agrees that any 'offended' 

373
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,762
 And that has a vague meaning, but let's talk about it later. 

374
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:51,956
 Who pays the state fee can ask for the recount. Also in Wisconsin. 

375
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:56,801
 And Michigan is also home to the University of Michigan. Where I live. 

376
00:23:56,801 --> 00:24:00,038
 In the State of Michigan the state board of solicitors, 

377
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:02,925
 which is how the governing body that determines the election works. 

378
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:05,601
 That decides how the recount will be done. 

379
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:08,790
 And fortunately in Michigan they decided to make a full recount. 

380
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,763
 They were going to put all the records back in the electronic ballot boxes. 

381
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:16,677
 And finally in Pennsylvania, again another fierce edge. 0.72 percent. 

382
00:24:16,677 --> 00:24:21,448
 And unfortunately in Pennsylvania they use almost exclusively paperless DRE ballot boxes. 

383
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:26,155
 Like the ones you use here in Brazil. Only 30 percent of the votes are on paper. 

384
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:29,749
 And the Pennsylvania counting law is a little crazy. 

385
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:35,949
 It takes 3 inhabitants of each precinct, to pay a 500 dollar fee 

386
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:41,225
 and swear it was a fraud. This in every precinct. 

387
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:44,426
 To request a recount in the state of Pennsylvania 

388
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:48,732
 we're going to have to find something around 9,000 people to swear 

389
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:51,982
 that there was electoral fraud and pay to be made a recount. 

390
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:53,471
 That seems a little unlikely. 

391
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:56,527
 And unfortunately the state has a recount 

392
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:59,977
 automatic if the margin is less than 0.5 percent. 

393
00:24:59,977 --> 00:25:01,992
 It's automatic, it counts at the state level. 

394
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:04,485
 But as we can see, we have almost reached that margin. 

395
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:08,229
 We choose these three states. 

396
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:12,500
 But how did President Trump and other people notice? Why do not we choose others? 

397
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,584
 Well, here it is focused on Virginia, New Hampshire and California. 

398
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:20,244
 And indeed we have other theories about the state of New Hampshire. 

399
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:25,167
 The state of New Hampshire the deadline happens 6 days after the election. 

400
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:28,012
 So do not give time, we had no idea 

401
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:31,185
 of what we were doing two weeks after the election. 

402
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:39,602
 In the state of Virginia it is illegal to recount if the margin is less than 1 percent. 

403
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:42,187
 And Clinton won in Virginia with more than 5 percent. 

404
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:44,632
 Which is also a crazy law. 

405
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:47,398
 You can not see the paper unless the percentage is next. 

406
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:52,309
 And in the state of California, the margin was 38 percent. So it's quite unlikely. 

407
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:57,203
 And in California historically everyone votes 'blue'. 

408
00:25:57,203 --> 00:26:00,133
 So there are not many questions about the results there. 

409
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:03,809
 I should also mention that there was recount of votes in the state of Nevada. 

410
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:07,276
 And it was very inconclusive. It's something separate from that. 

411
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:10,654
 But with all effort was recounted. 

412
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,368
 So we have our states, we have our money, we have our candidate. 

413
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:16,041
 Let's start the recount. 

414
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:21,973
 So in all states we requested these petitions, Jill Stein requested all we had. 

415
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:27,259
 Basically saying: Hey, we want to recount, here's the money. Do it! 

416
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:33,220
 And unfortunately this angered the elected President Trump. 

417
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,847
 Claiming it was a blow to fill the pockets of Green Party. 

418
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,439
 Which was not really the point. 

419
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:44,432
 As you can see, we spent five weeks to accomplish this. 

420
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:46,297
 We were running out of time. 

421
00:26:47,855 --> 00:26:51,494
 I should mention that the campaign was really possible. 

422
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:55,673
 thanks to Stein's campaign and the Green Party's 10,000 volunteers. 

423
00:26:55,686 --> 00:26:58,649
 This incredible advocacy Emery Celli Brinckerhoff and Abady. 

424
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:02,352
 He organized lawyers all over the United States. 

425
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:06,165
 To request petitions, and check the recount and organize people. 

426
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:12,590
 Also many e-voters experts in the United States. 

427
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,545
 They also helped to require and support efforts. 

428
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:18,446
 So even if it's me speaking 

429
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:20,184
 I'm just a small part of it. 

430
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:23,212
 How does a recount look? 

431
00:27:23,212 --> 00:27:24,516
 Well, it looks like that. 

432
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:26,404
 That's in Washtenaw County in Michigan. 

433
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:28,682
 Which is where I live, and I'm there in this photo. 

434
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:33,972
 In fact the way a recount works, you have a large heap of ballots. 

435
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,325
 You have two workers with the ballots. And they get about 100 banknotes 

436
00:27:39,587 --> 00:27:42,681
 and they count in unison to make sure they do not mix. 

437
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:43,985
 Or forget a vow. 

438
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:46,048
 How many votes are there? 

439
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,961
 Well, this is happening. Other people are sitting at the table, they are party volunteers. 

440
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:53,335
 I was there for Green Party. 

441
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:56,177
 This gentleman here was in favor of Trump's campaign. 

442
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,442
 To make sure these two ladies here are doing exactly what we expect. 

443
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:03,272
 So that there is no ambiguity in the recount. 

444
00:28:03,963 --> 00:28:06,509
 The recount also looks like this. 

445
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:13,706
 When we started recounting, Donald Trump sued us in every state we tried to recount. 

446
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:16,304
 Basically restricting or claiming 

447
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:18,716
 depending on state law this is not legal. 

448
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:19,714
 You can not do that. 

449
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,698
 So we had a lot of lawsuits because of that. 

450
00:28:23,698 --> 00:28:28,512
 And it also looks like that. In response to Trump's lawsuits 

451
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:33,400
 and in response to Michigan residents the people protested. 

452
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:37,337
 So Lansing is the capital of Michigan, as you can see there's a big protest here. 

453
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:40,558
 They wanted the revised result. 

454
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:46,632
 And we have that too. These are members of the US press. They were there covering everything. 

455
00:28:46,632 --> 00:28:50,005
 Minute by minute. As you can see it was not always fun. 

456
00:28:50,005 --> 00:28:52,119
 Every now and then they had to stay in the corner. 

457
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:55,929
 And it looked like that. This is a press conference in Philadelphia. 

458
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:59,733
 You can see Jill Stein in the middle talking to these reporters. 

459
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:02,332
 You can see Alex back here. And that was before they finished 

460
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,430
 to argue with the court, I believe. 

461
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:09,971
 And of course this has become newspaper cover story in all these states. 

462
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:12,158
 Here's Alex and Jill a few hours later. 

463
00:29:12,455 --> 00:29:17,972
 Trying to enjoy this incredible moment of stress. 

464
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:23,100
 Well the election ... in fact we did not have that time limit of five weeks. 

465
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:25,517
 And then the election is set, Donald Trump is declared victorious. 

466
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:27,417
 As everyone knows now. 

467
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:32,695
 So you mean it's all done? More or less. 

468
00:29:32,695 --> 00:29:36,854
 The Wisconsin recount was finally over, they recounted every ID. 

469
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:40,034
 Not all counted by hand but they all told. 

470
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:44,179
 The state of Michigan, I mentioned earlier that there was cause for 'offense'. 

471
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,196
 Well, Donald Trump lost in the state of Michigan and at the same time claimed 

472
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:53,836
 that Jill Stein was not 'offended' because she had only 1 percent of votes. 

473
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:58,478
 So unfortunately the Michigan recount was cut in half. 

474
00:29:58,478 --> 00:30:04,859
 And the recount in Pennsylvania has never really started. Just a formal recap. 

475
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:09,736
 In Wisconsin, more than half of the ballots were counted by hand. 

476
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:16,059
 Even 51 counties ... Yes 51 counties counted by hand. 

477
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:22,401
 11 thousand 883 different votes. I want to remind you that the margin 

478
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:24,898
 victory in Wisconsin was only 22,000 votes. 

479
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:29,229
 In principle this is enough to dribble the margin. 

480
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:33,373
 That's almost 12,000 people whose votes did not count for the first time. 

481
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,156
 Because the electronic ballot box was so bad to register your votes. 

482
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:42,024
 Even so, the exchange of votes over the 

483
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:44,598
 was not enough, something around 400 votes. 

484
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,877
 Just the exchange of candidates. 

485
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:49,322
 And we can not say that there is evidence of attack. 

486
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:51,804
 We can say that the machines were old. But only that. 

487
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:56,437
 And in the Michigan recount I mentioned that it was paralyzed after 3 days. 

488
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,040
 10 counties in Michigan were finalized. 

489
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,504
 12 started but did not finish in the total of 83. 

490
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:07,415
 Almost 2.1 million banknotes were recounted. That's 43 percent. 

491
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:13,155
 And just a change in the network, 200 votes. And again no evidence of attack. 

492
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:18,658
 In Pennsylvania we can say that one or two counties began recounting. 

493
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:24,187
 In just a few of their precincts. And we've never seen anything published about it. 

494
00:31:24,187 --> 00:31:27,641
 So we are not clear what happened. 

495
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:32,662
 Our lesson here about Pennsylvania is that it is very difficult to do a recount. 

496
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:37,188
 Even if nothing has changed, in terms of votes. 

497
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,236
 We have discovered several interesting things. 

498
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:41,742
 Then in Detroit, Michigan. 

499
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:46,080
 Originally they found that 37% of the precincts had too many votes. 

500
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,986
 They had more votes than voters. That does not seem right. 

501
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:55,613
 And during the recount they discovered that half of the precincts in Detroit were ineligible for recounting. 

502
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,509
 And that's because in the state of Michigan there is this law that says 

503
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:01,771
 the course of his record, the seal behind, 

504
00:32:01,771 --> 00:32:05,182
 to the minutes that the clerk has to write everything that happens. 

505
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:09,855
 And if any of these have been lost, it's broken, or anything else. 

506
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:15,046
 You can not recount. You have to accept the original results. 

507
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:18,683
 Which is crazy. Because if you want to hack an election, 

508
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:22,266
 you can hack and destroy all evidence and it will be illegal 

509
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:24,437
 in Michigan find out what really happened. 

510
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:30,632
 So we have all this evidence now. But what will we do with it? 

511
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:35,086
 What I want is called Statistical Risk-Limiting Audit 

512
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:38,387
 And basically you count a small number of bills and 

513
00:32:38,683 --> 00:32:44,411
 compares with electronic ballot boxes and you have an idea of ​​how accurate the election was. 

514
00:32:44,411 --> 00:32:47,226
 And depending on the margin, and the exclamation you chose 

515
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:50,604
 you continue to count until you are satisfied with the results. 

516
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:54,243
 Or you count all the bills. And you can know what happened. 

517
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:58,726
 The idea here is ... the key here is sample alternation of seals. 

518
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:02,133
 Unfortunately because this recount was not random. 

519
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:05,565
 Because in Wisconsin they used the technology to count. 

520
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,341
 We had no randomness. 

521
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:12,895
 So unfortunately we have this sample incomplete and not random. 

522
00:33:12,895 --> 00:33:15,824
 What really should update the samples. 

523
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:17,208
 We now have seal level information. 

524
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,819
 But what can we do with it? 

525
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:22,604
 So to make sure of the attack scenarios. 

526
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:24,419
 That I may be looking for this evidence. 

527
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:28,511
 Three types of scenarios, where the attack chokes the vote. 

528
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:31,607
 Where they prevent people from voting depending on the candidate they are voting for. 

529
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:36,685
 They compromise election ballot sellers like GVS that I spoke to earlier. 

530
00:33:36,857 --> 00:33:39,202
 Or they individually compromise electronic ballot boxes. 

531
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:44,161
 Then the malware goes to the polling place and infects all those 

532
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,584
 urns with the virus or just an electronic urn. 

533
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:52,988
 So if the alternation ... sorry. 

534
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:55,567
 If the recount of the alternate counties is done by hand, 

535
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,973
 so in theory we can detect all this. 

536
00:33:57,973 --> 00:34:02,901
 We got to see a lot of votes. We can see several balance sheets 

537
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:05,590
 on paper that does not correspond to electronic records. Something of that nature. 

538
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,601
 That's what we're looking for here. 

539
00:34:08,251 --> 00:34:14,418
 And again I want to talk, we knew that I had an opponent to the presidency in that election. 

540
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:20,150
 The US government, the congress and the president had already said they were investigating this. 

541
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:24,107
 The intelligence community in the United States had also 

542
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:28,703
 'Hey, Russia is trying to elect Donald Trump.' 

543
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:33,887
 So with that in mind ... finally we find it much later 

544
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:36,718
 that really they actually hacked one of the electronic ballot companies. 

545
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:40,511
 One called VR Systems. And it is suspect that this has caused 

546
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,401
 service errors in the state of North Carolina. 

547
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,696
 But he did not show anything else either. 

548
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:49,195
 Then we know that we were hacked. 

549
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:52,376
 And we were trying to figure out how much it had affected and the consequences. 

550
00:34:52,514 --> 00:34:55,897
 So me and Walter Mebane, he's a political scientist. 

551
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:58,924
 and a professor of statistics at the University of Michigan. 

552
00:34:58,956 --> 00:35:05,050
 And I had this information trying to figure out some way to make sense. 

553
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,527
 And then we posted a 'Blogpost' in the Washington Post Monkey Cage Blog, 

554
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:11,876
 where you can read more interesting things. 

555
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,388
 And we had the paper on subjection as well. 

556
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:18,346
 What is our plan here? 

557
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:22,940
 We want to focus on the differences in the signals between the candidates. 

558
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,653
 Enter the original count against the total recount of each candidate who has changed. 

559
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:31,419
 You know, whether they have won or lost, or if they have remained the same. 

560
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:36,952
 We want to contrast the differences not shown with those shown. 

561
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:40,887
 We want to see the candidates who lost votes with the votes 

562
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:43,115
 lost Trump or the lost Clinton votes. 

563
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:47,999
 And we want to see if this sampling impacts change. 

564
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:54,868
 What we used was multinomial regression to correlate factors. 

565
00:35:54,869 --> 00:36:00,802
 Like sellers, specific electronic ballot boxes, the candidate that was chosen and other things. 

566
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:06,808
 And the goal here was to try to see that the reported samples and the uninformed samples are not the same. 

567
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:11,544
 So you have many differences not shown. Candidate A, Candidate B gained lost votes. 

568
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:15,639
 And you have many unseen differences that say Clinton and Trump have won many lost votes. 

569
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:19,488
 If there were no differences between these two candidates in theory there was no hack. 

570
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,856
 Or at least the hack was inefficient. 

571
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:31,198
 So looking at the results here. In the state of Wisconsin we found nothing significant correlated. 

572
00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:35,151
 There were no significant differences between hand and machine recounts. 

573
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:41,619
 In the state that is good to know that hired the machines that recounted could also be hacked. 

574
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,986
 Overall we found no evidence that fraud occurred. 

575
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:48,378
 Or if there was such fraud did not influence the consequences. 

576
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:51,338
 It can not be said with certainty, because of the electronic ballot boxes. 

577
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:58,906
 We saw that an electronic ballot box had high error rates. More than others. 

578
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:01,203
 And it's the Optech IIIP Eagle. 

579
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:07,315
 And in response to this the state of Wisconsin withdrew this urn. 

580
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:11,083
 So we do not use her anymore. Which leaves us relieved. 

581
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:15,843
 In the state of Michigan, again nothing significant correlative. 

582
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:19,011
 We found no evidence of fraud affecting the consequence. 

583
00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:23,147
 We saw significant problems in Detroit. 

584
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:27,296
 In response to this the state of Michigan decided to play out 

585
00:37:27,507 --> 00:37:29,138
 all electronic ballot boxes and bought new ballot boxes. 

586
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:32,341
 So we had some conclusions about all of this. 

587
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:36,466
 To conclude here, hack the presidential elections 

588
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:37,898
 is currently very easy. 

589
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:42,626
 It looks like it happened in 2016 but it does not mean it will happen again. 

590
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:46,511
 We continue to use these vulnerable electronic ballot boxes 

591
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:48,862
 which has this central point of attack. 

592
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:53,798
 States are beginning to worry about these messages. 

593
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:55,765
 'Hey, you really should see the papers.' 

594
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:59,760
 The state of Rhode Island for example incorporated the law. 

595
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:02,460
 But in general most states will not look. 

596
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:08,118
 And even if you get far enough with the role, there are still 

597
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,274
 many legal obstacles along the way. 

598
00:38:10,546 --> 00:38:13,875
 For example the 'offense' clause in the Michigan Constitution. 

599
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:18,138
 Or the Pennsylvania mechanism to ensure its recount. 

600
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:21,058
 Or stop at the time to see the paper. 

601
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:26,094
 This is bad. We have seen an adversary nation. 

602
00:38:26,094 --> 00:38:30,291
 Many intelligence officials from the United States have said that Russia will return. 

603
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:35,274
 And there's no reason to think they elected Trump and left. 

604
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:38,076
 So we need to fix this in the United States. 

605
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:40,659
 We need to renew our equipment technology. 

606
00:38:40,673 --> 00:38:43,218
 We need to stop using equipment with bad encryption security. 

607
00:38:43,636 --> 00:38:50,316
 Open in SSL version 1.1 for example. With shared keys at every urn that are in use. 

608
00:38:50,835 --> 00:38:53,632
 And we need to make sure an attack is detectable. 

609
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,806
 We need paper records. 

610
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:58,564
 We need something we can use to check the urns. 

611
00:38:58,564 --> 00:39:01,924
 And there are still many states that do not have that. 

612
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:03,701
 Or at least it does not have it everywhere. 

613
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:06,941
 And finally we need to use the evidence. 

614
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:10,125
 We have to make these limitations of risks or recounts depending on the law. 

615
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:14,524
 If we are going to do risk auditing it is much cheaper than the total recount. 

616
00:39:14,717 --> 00:39:17,997
 In states with large margins such as in Alabama for example in 2016, 

617
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:22,101
 you can retell seventy bills to confirm the result. 

618
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:25,540
 And what we can do, but it can not be done because they have no paper 

619
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:26,820
 or the law does not allow doing. 

620
00:39:27,317 --> 00:39:34,342
 These reforms can be used in 2018. When it's our half election, almost a year from now. 

621
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,112
 We just have to act. 

622
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:40,411
 So I want to thank everyone who listened. 

623
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,649
 And I'll be happy to answer questions.
