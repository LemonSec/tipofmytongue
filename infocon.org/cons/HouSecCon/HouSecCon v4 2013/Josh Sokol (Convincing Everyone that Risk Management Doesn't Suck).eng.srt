1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:35,010
all four years sure so forgive the long

2
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,140
title please I couldn't think of

3
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,180
anything better to try and attract

4
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,430
people here to solicit talk about risk

5
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,129
management I've I've heard playing

6
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,660
people talk about risk management in the

7
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,270
past and frankly it's just been really

8
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,610
really boring and so my goal with this

9
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,550
talk was really to show you guys how you

10
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,010
can top risk management with your peers

11
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,170
how you can talk risk management with

12
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,379
your managers and basically convince

13
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,059
yourself that risk management is

14
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,799
actually something worth doing it's

15
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,310
something worthwhile and can even be fun

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,740
so I'm Josh simple I'm the information

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,570
scary programmer at national instruments

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,450
I do all sorts of stuff architecture

19
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,000
policy but not one of the things that

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,470
recently I've been doing a lot of

21
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,630
research on a lot of work on is risk

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,070
management so that's what I'm talking

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,509
about that so if you've had any issues

24
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,729
convincing management to undertake

25
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,500
security projects hopefully this talk

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,259
will be very useful to you if you've had

27
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,820
any issues use to disclose

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,560
vulnerabilities again hopefully will be

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,409
useful propolis management it's about

30
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,140
using risks to drive organizational

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,009
improvement and we'll talk a little bit

32
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,259
about how we actually use risk

33
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,630
management to do that and like I said if

34
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,579
you do it right you can actually be

35
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,460
interesting anything extremely valuable

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,009
to both you and your organization it's

37
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,590
also a good career builder so let's

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,820
start and talk a little bit about

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,000
personal risk management so the reason

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,439
why I like to start with this is because

41
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,670
it's something well

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,290
are you doing and so it brings risk

43
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,639
management back to something that we're

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,310
all very familiar with in this case this

45
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,349
is my house well it's not really my

46
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,230
house but you get the idea so when you

47
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,270
look at your house you have to evaluate

48
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,520
things around you you have to evaluate

49
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,709
things like the location of your house

50
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,840
you have to evaluate things like who

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,540
your neighbors are right and what you're

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,550
doing is you're basically making a risk

53
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,650
decision so you're looking at what is

54
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,350
the likelihood of something happening to

55
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,840
my house right and then you start

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,010
looking at the things that you have

57
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,930
inside of your house you start looking

58
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,000
at the nice TV that you just bought or

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,190
the stereo system or maybe the car

60
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,470
that's sitting in the garage try and you

61
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,330
start looking at what's the value of

62
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,010
those things and then you determine what

63
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,530
the impact is to you if those things

64
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,340
were stolen right so if you if you're

65
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,209
cissp or if you're looking at getting

66
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,850
your cissp there's a classic risk formal

67
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,080
and we'll talk about this a little bit

68
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,560
risk is likely the times impact right so

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,030
what we're doing here is we're actually

70
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,269
looking negations so we've decided what

71
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,980
are what our impact is what the

72
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,690
likelihood is and now we're trying to

73
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,760
figure out how do we mitigate that so

74
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,709
maybe I decide that I live in a horrible

75
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,989
neighborhood I need bars on my windows

76
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,000
right and maybe I need things like

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,609
motion detectors or maybe I keep servers

78
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:25,620
in my basement I need some water sensors

79
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,410
from so we're basically making decisions

80
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,690
on a personal level this has nothing to

81
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,579
do with my company and we're making

82
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,799
decisions on a personal level about the

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,079
risks that affect us and how we plan to

84
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,329
mitigate that when we bring this into

85
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,250
the other prize it is no different than

86
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,540
that so real quick show of hands who

87
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,549
here has an existing risk management

88
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,590
program third of the rumor sell okay who

89
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,090
is interested in starting a risk

90
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,660
management program yeah a couple people

91
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,970
so maybe we got hat or the other half of

92
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,950
you here for if you don't have a program

93
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,660
and the idea trusted and start why are

94
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,760
you here well hopefully you learn

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,580
something anyways right

96
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,630
let's err so in any case let's talk

97
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,910
about threats and consequences when

98
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,500
we're talking risk management we have to

99
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,660
know what the threats off and there's a

100
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,579
whole bunch of different threats and so

101
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,860
what we have right here is a type of

102
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,870
risk in this case financial loss

103
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,700
reputation damage I'll show more on the

104
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,590
next slide and then we have different

105
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,960
consequences ranging from low to medium

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,840
to high so in the case of financial loss

107
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,540
Arlo consequences that business unit

108
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,370
manager could contain the anticipate

109
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,460
loss in our operational budget our

110
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,740
medium consequence is a GM could taint

111
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,230
contain that loss by shifting some funds

112
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,930
and priorities and our high consequence

113
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,850
is recovery from the anticipated loss

114
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,070
would be handled by the CEO and board as

115
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,130
a special item right so we're looking at

116
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,410
what the threats are and we're looking

117
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,030
at what is the impact of each of those

118
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,100
things so we also have things like

119
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,350
regulatory non-compliance what happens

120
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,200
if I don't eat my pc I obligations or

121
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,930
business interruption downtime das right

122
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,230
and safety hazards all of these are

123
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,910
different types of risks that depending

124
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,980
on our job and our function we may have

125
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,730
to consider for our company risk

126
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,390
management in an ideal scenario is about

127
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,490
prioritization so we talked a little bit

128
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,830
before about what impact in what

129
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,020
likelihood are what we like to do is we

130
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,080
like to map those guys so we take the

131
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,690
risk with the greatest loss impact and

132
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,660
the gray is probably likelihood and we

133
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,430
basically do that mathematical formula

134
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,860
likely times impact we usually try and

135
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,630
give this a one through five scale or

136
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,220
something like that one two three four

137
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,350
five one two three four five and then we

138
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,290
map them and what we end up with is a

139
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,080
list where the stuff that we care about

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,570
most is usually the stuff with the

141
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,180
greatest likely an impact and it ends up

142
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,720
way over here all the way down to the

143
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,370
stuff that we don't care about quite as

144
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,370
much which ends up way down here so now

145
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,840
we're going to look at this list where I

146
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,970
will say well the stuff when we're doing

147
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,790
prioritization we usually want to start

148
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,490
up here and work our way back now there

149
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,380
is a exception to that which is level of

150
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:19,729
effort

151
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,059
because this thing might take fighting

152
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:24,620
everybody in my company and starting

153
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,999
over with a new crew in order to

154
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:27,710
actually do something like that that's a

155
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,199
huge level of effort we don't do that so

156
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,050
risk management methodologies there's a

157
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,460
whole bunch of different methodologies

158
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,930
out there there'll be a test at the end

159
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,559
of the presentation okay there's lots of

160
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,089
different methodologies out there and

161
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:45,830
the will to take right here is that

162
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,990
there's a bunch of stuff out there but

163
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,479
there's somebody else's vision of what

164
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,360
risk management should be at best

165
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,879
they're guideline they give you examples

166
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,740
what other people are doing what other

167
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,479
people think risk management should look

168
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,759
like but at worse they make risk

169
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,529
management look really complicated and

170
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,629
make it difficult to get started how

171
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,309
many of you guys have looked at one of

172
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:09,319
these in the passing on oh crap I can't

173
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:13,129
do that right they're difficult and i

174
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,830
start with the nist 830 the first time i

175
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,569
looked at if you're familiar with any

176
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,629
government documentation man who makes

177
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:26,149
your head spin right so let's talk about

178
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:29,330
define risk risk you the potential that

179
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,909
chosen action or activity including the

180
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,009
choice of inaction will lead to a loss

181
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:38,180
or some sort of undesirable outcome so

182
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,370
will can apply to all sorts of different

183
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,550
things it can be economic risk health

184
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,629
safety and environmental IT and infosec

185
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,279
insurance business management finance

186
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,599
security right so let's how you a little

187
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,059
story when i first started looking into

188
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,719
this i started looking at a sub tools

189
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,580
called GRC governance risk and

190
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,039
compliance and this was when i first

191
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,050
took over the security program is

192
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,509
basically non-existent and I I start

193
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:11,149
with zero budget and I basically said

194
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:14,990
hey this GRC think we need this we have

195
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,839
to be able to manage our risks so I put

196
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,279
it in the budget half a million dollars

197
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,740
$500,000 debris in GRC tool 10 I you

198
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,330
know what happen when I put that in my

199
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,990
budget they laughed at me it's my first

200
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,310
year during the budget

201
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,530
laughed at me because i work from 0 to

202
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,299
half a million dollars in no time flat

203
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:39,230
right so what I do I went and I talked

204
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,530
to the guys who lead all these teams I

205
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,600
talked to my finance guy I talked to the

206
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,360
OSHA guy Ryan I talked to some of the IT

207
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,230
people and I said hey I want to show you

208
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,840
guys some so look at this GRC tool and I

209
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,730
had one of the Bender's come out and I

210
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,770
had them do the whole dog and pony show

211
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,870
and said isn't this awesome once you

212
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,520
guys love to have this and they say yes

213
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,260
and I said all right it's half a million

214
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,910
dollars split between 10 teams that's

215
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,760
50,000 East and they said no we can't do

216
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,690
that great so I was having a lot of

217
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,990
trouble trying to figure out how do i do

218
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,500
risk management I'll talk a little bit

219
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,300
about the end result of that in a second

220
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,170
in any case risk applies to everybody so

221
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,440
I miss formula this is the the standard

222
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,050
cissp you go take the test this is the

223
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,120
answer right Michael is the probability

224
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,220
of something occurring impact is the

225
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,100
expected loss that if I event occurs and

226
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,410
so i Wis formula is likely at times

227
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,290
impact so this should look very similar

228
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,720
that's what we had over there and we get

229
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,850
kind of this weird chart where the

230
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,710
higher likelihood higher impact starts

231
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,900
tough stuff starts there then it works

232
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,270
the way back to medium and then loan and

233
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,780
insignificant don't look very good on

234
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,880
this resolution that looks a little

235
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,360
better now one of the first things I

236
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,770
learned about risk management while I

237
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,420
was going through this is that this

238
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,480
formula did it fit me I was going

239
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,880
through I was calculating all my rhythm

240
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,120
or not I realize that for my company

241
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,400
likely at times impact was kind of off

242
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,390
it didn't feel right for me I liked

243
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,570
likelihood times impact and I felt like

244
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,540
impact needed to be weighted in there

245
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,880
additionally i felt like impact head was

246
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,850
more substantial so what you can do is

247
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,040
you can actually modify that formula and

248
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,930
in my case I said whisk is likely at

249
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,660
times impact less impact I add that

250
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,000
impact modifier and actually excuse it a

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,470
little bit

252
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,400
this is that same scale basically I have

253
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,100
anything above a seven is high anything

254
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,260
above a four is medium and anything

255
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,900
above a lawn is low and then anything up

256
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,630
less than one is insignificant you can

257
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,060
see how it kind of shifts out now

258
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,740
instead of having these guys all is

259
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,940
insignificant these guys are low right

260
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,530
and you can see how the whole thing

261
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,200
highest shifts this way well just like

262
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,210
you can do this let's say maybe I

263
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,090
consider likely to be more important so

264
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,030
I can flip that and I can say it's

265
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,680
likely times impact less likelihood

266
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,560
maybe I consider to be a doubly

267
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,600
important so I do less likelihood plus

268
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,480
likelihood the takeaway here is that the

269
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,060
wrist formula the formula itself doesn't

270
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,190
really matter the idea is that you

271
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,930
should make your formula fit your

272
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:40,060
company make the math work for you be

273
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,000
flexible this management needs to be a

274
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,040
custom fit your organization and your

275
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
formula needs to reflect that so any

276
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,380
tool anything that you start using for

277
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,510
risk management needs to keep this in

278
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,370
mind you need to be able to modify

279
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,460
things modify on the plot so after I got

280
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,980
through with all the the GRC talk and

281
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,100
got shot down twice I ended up finding

282
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,440
out that there was a risk guy at and I

283
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,410
many years before I got there and he had

284
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,510
actually built a custom risk management

285
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,060
database in lotus notes frowny face

286
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,660
right but it was something the problem

287
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,540
was when I started playing risks into

288
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,720
there and I got a hundred risks in and

289
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,850
then all of a sudden I decided to change

290
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,480
my formula Lotus Notes laughed at me man

291
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,720
it didn't work I had to go in to each

292
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,990
risk resave it and then lowest notes

293
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,030
since I adjusted the formula would

294
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,730
change the risk level I had to

295
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,129
programmatically change it it sucked

296
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,959
so take away your formula can and likely

297
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,300
will change and wherever you're tracking

298
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,040
wrists you should be able to dynamically

299
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,139
update the risk based on the updated

300
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,779
formula what does this mean it means no

301
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,540
word documents no Excel documents no

302
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,059
static former formats so all of the

303
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,709
people here who raised their hands and

304
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:03,999
said you're already doing the risk

305
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,189
management program how many of you guys

306
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:09,759
are using stack formats you wanna cop to

307
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:17,079
it so convincing your management if you

308
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,089
get anything how do this talk today

309
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,459
anything on my presentation take this

310
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:24,939
away this man who will fail if you don't

311
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,519
have management participation the whole

312
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,100
goal of risk management is to create a

313
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,499
prioritization framework and if you can

314
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:34,269
prioritize those with and pull them out

315
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,889
there the management now has the

316
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,290
visibility into it and you can use that

317
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,029
for projects and things like that going

318
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,980
forward it becomes part of your budget

319
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,779
process management speaks whisk it's

320
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,529
cool if you know risk they don't speak

321
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,559
CVEs they don't speak attack vectors

322
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,269
they don't speak threat trees they speak

323
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:59,019
risk but so when you're going and you're

324
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:00,519
sitting down with your management you're

325
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,049
trying to talk to me about the problems

326
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,850
in your environment don't sit down with

327
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,429
them until while the latest notes cve is

328
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,980
for blah blah blah x1 whatever tell them

329
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,529
what the whisk is of that then you'll

330
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,470
get their ear your responsibility as a

331
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,329
security professional is to collect and

332
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:19,990
convey risk management far too often as

333
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,959
security professionals we end up looking

334
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,429
at problems in our environment and we go

335
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:29,589
right around saying the sky is falling

336
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,279
crime and we try and say PCI compliance

337
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,379
says you do this and we can try and

338
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:39,009
force things on other people the problem

339
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,199
is people get resentful they don't like

340
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,959
being told what to do if you can frame

341
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,790
these discussions in terms of risk

342
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,960
management

343
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,530
right frame in terms of risks it's no

344
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,230
longer an adversarial relationship it's

345
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,450
me conveying what the problems are in

346
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,280
our element and now i can tell

347
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,950
management hey why don't you evaluate

348
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,870
this why don't you look at this and

349
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,420
decide what we want to do with that you

350
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,520
are accept it you want transferred you

351
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,190
all reduce it now management feels

352
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,470
empowered you look awesome because

353
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,000
you've been able to figure out what the

354
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,800
risks are you've been able to give

355
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,330
management the visibility and you've

356
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,160
been able to empower them to actually do

357
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:25,470
things with those risks sometimes not

358
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,230
related at all yes so the question is

359
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,730
that does this mean that we give

360
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,370
management kind of a risk matrix and

361
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,640
value and allow them to manipulate that

362
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,550
and the answer is absolutely right risk

363
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,160
management is a what's the right word

364
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,090
everybody's working together on this

365
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,610
right so when I do risk management and I

366
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,340
it's not about what I think the risk is

367
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,500
it's about what we think the risk is and

368
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,720
I will go and I will talk and I will sit

369
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,340
down with the team manager and I will

370
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,380
say hey what do you think this is and

371
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,880
they'll sit down with management say the

372
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
manager thinks it's this because of this

373
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,210
how do you guys feel it's a

374
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,630
collaborative process now if you do a

375
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,450
good job management through the process

376
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,430
of risk analysis then the other results

377
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,500
is that list of priorities that you can

378
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,930
then use for project but here's our

379
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,090
highest here's our medium here's our low

380
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,010
these are the things that are low level

381
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,990
of ever these are high level higher

382
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,970
level of effort these are the things you

383
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,650
know all these risk map back to this

384
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,110
thing which we should do for next year

385
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,950
now if you can't convince your peers

386
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,250
risk management lapel as well because

387
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,170
normally your peers are the ones who are

388
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,430
giving you risk and the first time I did

389
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,440
risk management exercise i sat down with

390
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,230
one of our unix admins so Josh I feel

391
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,610
like I'm at the doctor with my pants

392
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,680
down around my ankles it's like you know

393
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,690
this is hard for me to give up all this

394
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,410
stuff but the reality is it's stuff he's

395
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,779
been living with for years and years and

396
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,329
years always been at and I it's just the

397
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:05,030
skeletons in the closet we're trying to

398
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,380
do with risk management's we're trying

399
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,579
to bring those skeletons out of the

400
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,260
closet we want to put them wherever bike

401
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,730
and see them but at least we're

402
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,880
management can see them right so

403
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,640
managers management can only be

404
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,380
proactive in addressing risk if they're

405
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,500
aware that exists so you gotta tell your

406
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,559
peers that if this is in the closet and

407
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,640
it comes to light it's on your shoulders

408
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,100
but if you can get out of the closet and

409
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,080
she'll management this then we can

410
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,000
actually do something about so

411
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,799
undocumented risk means that you and

412
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,690
your peers shoulder the responsibility

413
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,240
if it happens documented risk means that

414
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,190
management acknowledges that the risk

415
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,919
exists and any action or inaction is now

416
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,640
on their shoulders now when you go to a

417
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,330
manager and you say here's a problem

418
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,640
today and you don't speak in terms of

419
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,940
risk they can brush it off they can walk

420
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,570
away now if you have a risk format an

421
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,910
actual system to keep track of ways to

422
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,320
make them make decisions based on risk

423
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,309
they have to actually go in and

424
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,260
acknowledge it even if they're

425
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,480
acknowledging says you know we're going

426
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,610
to just accept this risk they have to

427
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,360
choose to accept the risk yes sir I was

428
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,260
told like okay this is in my

429
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,139
in the signature journey employee you

430
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:33,749
have to sit here authority for that type

431
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,539
of defense and you're allowed SAT for

432
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:40,110
event okay that's right not that's

433
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,240
absolutely right and I'll talk a little

434
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,679
bit about how we handle that I than I to

435
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,629
so determining list your peers aren't

436
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,940
the only source they're probably or

437
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,590
hands down they're the best source

438
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,570
because they deal with this stuff on a

439
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,490
daily basis but there are certainly

440
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,159
other places if you can convince your

441
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,149
peers of the documenting risk is cyla

442
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:05,039
know you'll have Lewis then you really

443
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,720
know what to do with and this is what

444
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,879
happened with me I got hundreds of risks

445
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:11,580
from my different teams ultimately

446
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,169
there's things like network motor Billy

447
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:15,570
scanners application Barbie scales

448
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,600
secure email list blogs code reviews and

449
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,029
Twitter I follow a lot of security

450
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,919
professionals on Twitter and it's

451
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,220
amazing I you get this news before it's

452
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:33,090
news it's pretty cool so when we're

453
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,309
evaluating the risks we ask ourselves

454
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,980
three questions first is the risk

455
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,009
acceptable is the likely impact low

456
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:42,749
enough that i'm going to just accept the

457
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,090
consequences if it happens and like this

458
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,809
gentleman said oftentimes you certain

459
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:50,490
people on the decision-makers there

460
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,090
right if somebody who's a one of your

461
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,889
puter says yeah i'm just going except

462
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:57,600
that you said no this is a management

463
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,460
decision we need to bring this to

464
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,379
management and the appropriate level of

465
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:04,049
management that in order to have them

466
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:06,749
make that decision is the wrist

467
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:09,749
transferable can i purchase insurance or

468
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,690
some other means to transfer the impact

469
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,230
of the risk to somebody else and lastly

470
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,840
is there is reducible can i put some

471
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,539
sort of mitigation place to reduce the

472
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,340
impact or the likely of the risk from

473
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,769
happening so we ask those three

474
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:28,350
questions now the answer looks something

475
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,350
like this

476
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,360
if the risk is not acceptable and the

477
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,760
risk is not transferable and the risk is

478
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,900
not reduced well don't do it right and

479
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,580
that should be you as a security

480
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,289
professional that should be your advice

481
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:44,630
to management the answer is no no no

482
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,789
let's not do this let's figure out a

483
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:48,799
different way to accomplish that goal if

484
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,080
the answer is yes yes yes then we'll

485
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,179
have lots of options we can balance the

486
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:55,160
three options we can optimize we can buy

487
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,380
insurance we can accept some of the

488
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:02,030
stuff and we can mediate I'm so when

489
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,220
you're evaluating that think of this

490
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,980
grip this management is not a process

491
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,020
for avoiding risk that's what we do

492
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,679
today that's not good the aim of risk

493
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,570
management is not to eliminate risk

494
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,880
rather to manage risks involved in

495
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,130
business activities to maximize

496
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,080
opportunities in minimize adverse

497
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,140
effects I said earlier that management

498
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,780
speaks rarest most companies out there

499
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,120
are where they're at because they took

500
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,240
risks they just took calculated risks so

501
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,130
if we can talk to management about risk

502
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,190
and we can say hey here's the risk if we

503
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,049
do nothing this could happen if we may

504
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:45,830
get this this risk goes down right if we

505
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,630
can speak to them in that risk format

506
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,460
it's something that they are a

507
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,419
understand no risk management is not

508
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:56,000
management of in tribulus we can use

509
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,460
insurance for transferring lists but

510
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,130
most risks are managed by other means so

511
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,419
there are only so many things that we

512
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:04,070
can buy insurance for there's only so

513
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,940
much money to buy insurance risk

514
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,740
management should support strategic and

515
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,980
business planning absolutely

516
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,809
should support effective use of

517
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,299
resources promote continuous improvement

518
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:20,110
explicitly address uncertainty allow for

519
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,750
quick graphic view opportunities enhance

520
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,669
communication between business IT and

521
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:27,040
senior management reassure stakeholders

522
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,240
out focus and trail auto programs create

523
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,950
value be an integral part of

524
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,919
organizational processes be our decision

525
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,590
making systemic and structured best

526
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,110
available information tailored taking to

527
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,400
account human factors right now risk

528
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,620
management is cyclical and what I mean

529
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,570
by this is when you start out doing risk

530
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,610
management you're going to start looking

531
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,190
looking for threats you're identified

532
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,860
the threads here characterize them by

533
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,030
the teams they affect by the the

534
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,990
technologies they affect things like

535
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,169
that and you're going to assess what

536
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:07,299
where those threats lie so if I have a

537
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:10,179
windows vulnerability by run all linux

538
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,669
systems then it's probably not really a

539
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:13,960
threat to me and maybe a threat to

540
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,820
somebody but it's not to eat so that's

541
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,320
where we assess the vulnerability of the

542
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,530
assets to a specific threat then we go

543
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,740
we determine the risk to determine the

544
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,630
list we use that likelihood and impact

545
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,809
scale we use the formula tweaked to us

546
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,100
then we look at ways to reduce those

547
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,309
risks or mitigations we prioritize risk

548
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:38,230
reduction measures based on a strategy

549
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,270
we've taken in consideration business

550
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,720
constraints like money and resources and

551
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,360
then when we get through that we go back

552
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,730
to the beginning because risk is always

553
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,460
changing there's a temporal aspect there

554
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,650
right so the latest on zero day that

555
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,960
drops today at hue second I don't think

556
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,720
we have a zero day here right but not

557
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,240
risk today is huge if I were talking

558
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,919
about zero day you guys would be running

559
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,450
back to your office trying to figure out

560
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,760
you know how to how do we fix this how

561
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,100
you may get against this so the risk is

562
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,059
high and tomorrow when metasploit

563
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,740
develops a module for that it gets even

564
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,500
higher right because now script k can

565
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,090
run that but then the next

566
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,550
the vendor that I drop that zero develop

567
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,920
they develop a patch they release it to

568
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,420
the public you guys patch your systems

569
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,540
risk goes down here so risk is

570
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,730
constantly changing and because of that

571
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,740
we need to constantly be going back and

572
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,110
reassessing those risks also hopefully

573
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,280
because this is a prioritization process

574
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,050
we have people actually working to fix

575
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,880
this people trying to mitigate the risks

576
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,060
which means in a year's time or so maybe

577
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,800
those risks are closed maybe they're not

578
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,450
problems anymore so a risk review

579
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,550
process may depend on how new your

580
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,550
organizational structure is especially

581
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,990
on the management end of things but this

582
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,290
is what I do it n up the visibility of

583
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,470
lists I ways it depending on whether

584
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,320
it's low medium or high if it's a low

585
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,800
risk usually i will let a area manager

586
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,070
sign off on that the UX team manager the

587
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,630
windows team manager the network team

588
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,480
manager if it's a low SS that should be

589
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,860
something that they should be able to

590
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,220
handle right but if it's a medium level

591
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,560
risk that's something they'll ask way to

592
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,500
my directors and also hey directors you

593
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,940
know this is something that you guys

594
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,880
should look at if it's a high level risk

595
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,160
this is something that is the ability to

596
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,500
affect other systems the whole company

597
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,500
costs a lot of money that's something

598
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,900
that raise my BP so you can immediately

599
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,420
see how the risk management process will

600
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,820
drive visibility up the chain that's

601
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,340
what we want and we talked about way we

602
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,070
reviews I do the same thing with reviews

603
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,350
so low risk need to be reviewed annually

604
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,670
once a year we have to go through it and

605
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:08,270
re review those risks and the answer

606
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,190
might be except until next year that's

607
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,440
okay that's a valid answer as long as we

608
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,330
have the right person making that

609
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,840
decision about me medium risk we do

610
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,620
semi-annually and high-risk monthly you

611
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,080
can tweak this right this is me this is

612
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,730
my company this is my management

613
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,860
structure you can do whatever you'd like

614
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,679
here

615
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,870
now we talked about that all right

616
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,020
driving value yeah so when we're trying

617
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,570
to drive value from risk management the

618
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,100
first thing we do is we ordered by that

619
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,740
Whistler because the place where we're

620
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,270
going to immediately get the most bang

621
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,470
for our buck is in those high-level

622
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,990
risks those are the biggest issues in

623
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,789
our organization just by nature of the

624
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:54,710
risk management process so we worry

625
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,419
about the risks up here's our highest

626
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:00,169
here sir mediums here so it knows now if

627
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:02,929
the Mira gations are the same I group

628
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:07,600
those together so for example I may have

629
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,270
my year's team and my UX team is telling

630
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,970
me that they have you know that they're

631
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,070
built off of San fabric and when that

632
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,990
sand goes down everything goes down

633
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,520
every single unit system requires that

634
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,919
network mount and I have no other

635
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,900
network team that's telling me that they

636
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,640
don't have redundant hardware for this

637
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,890
core piece or Internet edge or whatever

638
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,440
right now I'm a on my windows team tell

639
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,780
me about something else all of those

640
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,820
kind of map back to the same thing and

641
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,610
maps back to disaster recovery so why

642
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,580
shouldn't I create a new project and

643
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,100
call it the disaster recovery project

644
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,440
and bucket all those risks on their

645
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,559
disaster recovery now I can go my

646
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,929
management and i can say i think that

647
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:52,429
next year we should have a disaster

648
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,500
recovery project and it's not just me

649
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,169
thinking that i have lists that all

650
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:59,390
relate back to that particular project

651
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,190
the network team thinks we should do it

652
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,049
the windows team thinks we fee do it

653
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,720
right and it gets back to that RI now I

654
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,789
have all these high-level risks that are

655
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,030
all being addressed by the same project

656
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,500
that's where prioritization comes back

657
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,539
to away and then you can pass these

658
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:16,340
things back if it's not me handling the

659
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,260
project maybe my director performance

660
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,850
review and says yeah that makes sense

661
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,919
you always said that that's a risk I

662
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,500
want to fix that so we passed those back

663
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,630
to the different teams and we tell him

664
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,250
that project was approved for

665
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,830
consideration next budget cycle maybe

666
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,659
now through the risk management process

667
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:34,580
gotten the green light by management to

668
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,500
me feel with that guy that's cool so

669
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,200
tools for phosphorus management most of

670
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,180
these kind of fallen

671
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,280
category called GRC governance risk and

672
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,710
compliance these tools are easily a

673
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,360
hundred thousand-plus from my company

674
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,390
their quote me five hundred thousand

675
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,800
different platforms here does anybody

676
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,790
here have a GRC platform peter is you're

677
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,190
lucky you're very lucky they are very

678
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,220
expensive they're huge what you some

679
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,890
thumbs up thumbs down you like your GRC

680
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,010
in the middle okay all right so he's the

681
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,900
lucky one he gives a thumbs in the

682
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,480
middle right well the unlucky ones were

683
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,540
using spreadsheets maybe nothing I got

684
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,430
kind of sick of this so i started using

685
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,380
that lowest notes database and i was

686
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,870
like man I can't use this it's not

687
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,790
flexible it's not all the stuff that we

688
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,680
just talked about out there and so

689
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,180
finally I decided to do something about

690
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,500
it so you guys get to see simple risk am

691
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,830
sorry camera people I'm gonna have to

692
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,900
come down here for my demo you'll see it

693
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,560
on the screen this is simple wrist so

694
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,470
simplest is PHP my sequel database

695
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,620
back-end I it is free it's open source

696
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,310
you can go simple restore to download in

697
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,710
this case I've installed a boon to box

698
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,170
you can install it wherever you want and

699
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,080
by nature of being PHP mi sequel it will

700
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,530
install pretty much anywhere i'm logging

701
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,650
in with my my admin account default on

702
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,400
is admin admin you can see here simplest

703
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,070
has a risk management section a

704
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,690
reporting section which is blank because

705
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,670
this is a brand new instance and a

706
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,620
configuration section so when you're

707
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,700
first starting out with risk management

708
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,530
everything that i talked about is here

709
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,360
the first thing is choosing your risk

710
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,150
formula so we got classic risk we've got

711
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,950
likely at times impact but we also have

712
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,050
some flexibility we can go white fluid

713
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,390
tons impact plus impact plus likelihood

714
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,280
we also have the ability to configure

715
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,410
what our high medium and low level risks

716
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,570
look like and what those levels look

717
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,890
like we even see that nice pretty

718
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,620
picture I showed in my presentation we

719
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,360
can configure a review settings how

720
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,190
often do we will review different levels

721
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,580
of risk high cell needs to be flexible

722
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,080
so here you go you can change my

723
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,810
categories my team's my locations why

724
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,809
you closed it

725
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:59,149
it's got a hole on user management

726
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:03,409
section including a module for Active

727
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:05,539
Directory authentication you can select

728
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:07,429
teams you can even define what

729
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:09,440
permissions people have so you can say

730
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,450
this person is able to submit risk this

731
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,539
person can modify risk here's my manager

732
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,340
he gets to review low res here's my

733
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,580
director he reviews medium here's my VP

734
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,220
she reviews high-level risks and I get

735
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,129
access to the configure menu you can

736
00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:27,200
change my naming convention so if you

737
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,909
don't like the fact that I called it in

738
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:30,830
significant you can change it to ever

739
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,740
you want simple risk maintains a full

740
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,419
audit trail so every single activity

741
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:37,279
within the system if it changes

742
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,749
something it gets logged in the audit

743
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:40,399
trail somebody's logging in it gets

744
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,519
logged in the art trail so let's go

745
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,950
ahead let's go risk management I'm gonna

746
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,399
smell new a new risk and this one is

747
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:51,499
going to be for Hugh second it's going

748
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:53,929
to be a hurricane it's Houston it's

749
00:31:53,929 --> 00:32:00,950
happened right we're all right so I can

750
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,509
go back it could happen and it's

751
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,970
happened before so we would add a new

752
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,590
value first of all for this one we need

753
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,440
to add a new where's my location was up

754
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,049
here there we go thank you you guys know

755
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,669
it better than I do how about that

756
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:25,460
houston houston we have a problem so we

757
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,220
just add a new location that easy we go

758
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:34,070
in here Houston has a hurricane and then

759
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,690
we go back to our site location we've

760
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,789
got Houston on here we give it a

761
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,440
category environmental resilience we

762
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,289
give it a team we don't really have a

763
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:46,639
good team for this ring called

764
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:48,679
information security we can give it a

765
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,929
different technology in this case let's

766
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:55,490
do data center owner so a user you have

767
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,899
in the system you can change that

768
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:59,929
managers will be in there as well we

769
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:01,549
have two different options for restoring

770
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:03,590
we can do that classic which you saw

771
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,929
their oil can do Steve ESS score which

772
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,879
is a pretty common standard especially

773
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:09,880
for technical vulnerabilities this

774
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,620
let's stick with classic what's the

775
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,960
likelihood you guys said it's pretty

776
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,000
unlikely so we'll go with that but the

777
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,680
impact if it happens it's pretty bad

778
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,040
right on an extreme Castro gorgeous

779
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,220
guess a major yeah yeah I mean if you're

780
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,250
on the coaster shred pretty bad your

781
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,520
longest tunnel yeah tunnels under the

782
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,250
city that could be pretty bad but those

783
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,360
get flying it's a risk assessment huge

784
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,070
set con might not happen if there is a

785
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,970
hurricane by the way Austin doing a

786
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,130
hurricane so last gone totally safe

787
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,470
that's too there we do so now we've gone

788
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,390
we submit our new wrist and told us that

789
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,820
so next up is we plan our nation's we go

790
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,710
in here we've got a new risk this one's

791
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,500
been given a low mostly because we said

792
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,000
that was very unlikely for it to happen

793
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,370
so here's our risk level we can see what

794
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,649
its mid we can see that no megan has

795
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,750
been planned yet no management review so

796
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,610
let's go ahead and put in a mag a shin

797
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,659
we give it a plane strategy in this case

798
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,860
there's not a whole lot that we can do

799
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,030
about this so let's just accept it our

800
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,820
effort is going to be well our

801
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,409
mitigation effort is going to be pretty

802
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:34,960
exceptional we have no solution right my

803
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,909
recommendation is maybe get a hot site

804
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:43,120
in Austin all right Pam so we go ahead

805
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,260
lease with that now it's disappeared we

806
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,639
plan on irrigation now we go into

807
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,010
management reviews now again management

808
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,570
reviews if you have permissions to

809
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,639
review this this is a low level risk so

810
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,080
if you have permissions then you'll be

811
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,700
able to do this you go the management

812
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,340
review you tell it to what my review is

813
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,800
in this case I approve it my next step

814
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,550
is well let's consider this for project

815
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:11,050
and think about a hot side yeah we hit

816
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,440
submit

817
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,869
and ours has been smooth management

818
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:17,940
review disappeared so these views will

819
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,859
only show the things that require action

820
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,740
now we go to prioritize for plant

821
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,780
planning we can see that we have an

822
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,550
unassigned riskier Houston has a

823
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,930
hurricane and we had a new new project

824
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,930
will call it hot side we add that

825
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,710
project we pull our hurricane into our

826
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,480
hot side project and then we save it now

827
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,250
if we have multiple projects this can

828
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,200
get kind of ugly as I've given you the

829
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,970
ability to prioritize your projects you

830
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,220
can drag them up down whatnot and then

831
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,869
you have a regular review piece we said

832
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:53,280
that we have to review these our regular

833
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,349
basis and based on this being a lower

834
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:56,849
risk we said that we have to review it

835
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:58,859
once a year so in this case my next

836
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:02,310
review date is October 12 2014 1 year

837
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,800
from that we have reporting built in so

838
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,050
now I can see my one risk that's not

839
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,300
very pretty but it's all there if you

840
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,760
put Morris and gets much nicer you can

841
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,859
see all of sign all open risk assigned

842
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,500
to me all along all of them my wrist

843
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,950
level you can look at all the clothes

844
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,530
risk there's nothing in there and then

845
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,810
you know let's say we end up fixing this

846
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,210
risk so once I do that I can go into

847
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,520
this risk I can see all the information

848
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,650
right here I can do a few things I can

849
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,270
change it to the CBS s forum which

850
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,099
doesn't make sense I could add a new

851
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,950
performance review or a new review I can

852
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,859
add comments to this risk oh by the way

853
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:43,619
comments down there audit trail each

854
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,599
risk keeps track of its own our trail as

855
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,150
well as the big one and then we can go

856
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,240
ahead and we can close the risk and when

857
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,890
we close the risk we can give it you

858
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,869
know say it's fully Meg aid can provide

859
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:57,750
some information we hit submit and now

860
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,230
if we go back to our reporting we no

861
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,810
longer have an open list we have a close

862
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,020
race

863
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:16,390
so that's simplest sabores design the

864
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,060
security mind parameterize database

865
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,300
queries mean people wont sequel injected

866
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,240
input validation very important HTML

867
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,280
output encoding prevents the cross-site

868
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,520
scripting hash passwords capable of

869
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,790
n-tier architecture so you can actually

870
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,760
have a separate PHP web server supper

871
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,800
database server contains a full audit

872
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,220
trail so security in mind it's free open

873
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,230
source Mozilla public license to point

874
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,420
out you can grab it at some poor store I

875
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,600
have a lamp installation guide and if

876
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,050
you're really slow at Linux it might

877
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,030
take you an hour I did this last night

878
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,670
it took me less than 15 minutes to

879
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,980
install and everything on that system

880
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,490
right there so if all this looks way too

881
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,320
cumbersome for you if you're like man I

882
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,270
don't know PHP I don't know my sequel I

883
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,460
don't know system administration I just

884
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,880
want a tool you can go hosted wristcom

885
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,070
we can give you a seven day trial you

886
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,500
can go beyond that I if you want to pay

887
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,780
for it but it's simple risk as a service

888
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,090
it's got the n-tier architecture decade

889
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,570
database decade server whatnot and it's

890
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,730
a fraction of the cost literally like

891
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,090
point one percent of the cost of one of

892
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,730
those half-a-million-dollar tools option

893
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,560
right so with that my talk is about done

894
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,660
I do have some simpler stickers if

895
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,430
you're interested I have a business card

896
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,560
but before I onion I want to tell you

897
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,750
guys about last car it is next week it's

898
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,640
in austin texas it's thursday and friday

899
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,700
we have some amazing speakers at least

900
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,400
one of them spoke here today but we got

901
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,290
mad johansson who i saw around here

902
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,480
before he's given the talk he gave it

903
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,130
black Hatter's and other guys given on

904
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,020
top from black hat got some other great

905
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,030
people as well we've got a mechanical

906
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,670
bull that's a picture of Samy Kamkar

907
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,970
arriving the

908
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,090
and you guys can use my code it's friend

909
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,920
of a friend and you get ten percent off

910
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,720
the cost and I believe that they were

911
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,210
going raise it a hundred dollars I don't

912
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,030
think they've done that yet so hopefully

913
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,290
you guys will see see you at last con

914
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,180
and with that thank you very much eight

915
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:38,170
questions for the real values in

916
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,080
focusing on negative risk oh you mean by

917
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,610
positive risk like blautsauger can be

918
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:54,100
now you're saying like the likelihood of

919
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,990
an impact of something good happening

920
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:00,460
basically I'm in it I guess technically

921
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,200
you could reverse this and say there's a

922
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,140
high likelihood something good happening

923
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,180
you know nothing wrong with that that's

924
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,500
not typically how we think of risk

925
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,300
management so you can definitely do that

926
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:52,630
kind of thing with the goal of risk

927
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,040
management is to address those high

928
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,020
level issues as fast as possible and

929
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,060
hopefully if we can tweak that formula

930
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,500
appropriately the number that are

931
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,630
feeding up to the VP is so small that

932
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:06,400
it's it's manageable right the idea is

933
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,790
you are shipped as much of that trap you

934
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,010
low-hanging whatever back to the section

935
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,320
managers and then drive the stuff that

936
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,810
really does need the visibility up to

937
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,390
the VP so my goal in this is I tweak

938
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,490
those formulas such that it looks like

939
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,670
that it's an iceberg well I guess kind

940
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,040
of with the vp on the small end right

941
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,290
and that all the big stuff going to the

942
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,670
section managers or of a pyramid I guess

943
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:37,570
hey other questions enjoy some stickers

944
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,020
thank you guys
