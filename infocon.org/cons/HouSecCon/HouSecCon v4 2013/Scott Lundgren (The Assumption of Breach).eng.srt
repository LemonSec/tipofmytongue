1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,649
y'all hear me yes no no yes all right so

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,360
thank you for volunteering for be my

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,389
blood guy my name is Scott wondrin I am

4
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,190
in san antonio with carbon black were

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,289
couple year old company doing what we

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,170
call endpoint visibility but this brief

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,240
leather presentation is not about the

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,980
company I'm on the wrong side honor

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,150
we'll see on this side so I got it yeah

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,160
so we'll bit about my background I've

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,800
been doing software for close to 20

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,800
years and scare yourself or more like 15

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,660
started Microsoft and then have been

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,570
doing some some interesting work in the

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,300
federal government kind of programs

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,469
somehow to San Antonio and some out of

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,140
Washington DC and then now I'm with come

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,230
back so what am I guess the key point

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,340
here what I'm trying to talk about the

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,680
day is what I call what is called the

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,180
assumption of breach which is the

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,969
fundamental tenant here is is that that

23
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,350
stuff happens and you can't help it

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,239
right in the real world it's going to

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,559
happen it has happened it will happen

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,500
and you really can't win if you're going

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,990
to try to say as long as my network is

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,360
connected to anything then I'm going to

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,500
make it on represent secure it's not

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,090
going to happen and I'm going to try to

31
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,619
talk through that not from a technical

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,450
perspective per se as in like well

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,770
here's some myths and here's how we can

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,970
move them in order to get them somewhere

35
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,320
but rather more of a process in

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,580
motivation and animal psychological

37
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,990
perspective which is you've got good

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,759
stuff that guys wanted it's going to

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,880
happen so the basic idea here is is that

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,290
your network whatever you're trying to

41
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,960
defend one way or another is going to be

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,619
either targeted by somebody specific or

43
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,850
you're going to be under more general

44
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,560
attack right just someone who is looking

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,360
for something a charger of opportunity

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,310
and sometimes when you think you found

47
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,659
something and you think it's a charge of

48
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,130
opportunity you're not targeted you in

49
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,659
fact are targeted because the guy on the

50
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,340
other side has stall all that through

51
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,899
and it's making his stuff look like

52
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,420
general stuff set track slide please

53
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,890
yeah this is the basic point right here

54
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,320
so my basic argument here is there's no

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,110
way around it

56
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,790
right past tense future tense present

57
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,169
tense present progressive all those

58
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,600
tenses it's happening right now if you

59
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,880
don't agree with me I guess then we

60
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,810
probably don't have much to talk about

61
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,730
in the sensitive you know this is this

62
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,740
is this is where I come out and the rest

63
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,970
is presentations about this and yeah it

64
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,530
happens a lot of ways right we all know

65
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:32,890
that come on so this is I got that on

66
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,190
buddy of mine who has a 800 acre farm in

67
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,740
Illinois and that's his uh that's what

68
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,180
he says all the time and what's wrong

69
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,020
with that the UH there's no one we know

70
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,640
this right there's no way around it as

71
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,230
long as you have people on the other end

72
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,370
of it they're going to do things you

73
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,540
don't want them to you can write more

74
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,520
rules right you can add more policy and

75
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,190
what's it mean right not much and I say

76
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,680
this is you know as me legitimize I can

77
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,030
on the basis that I'm the director of

78
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,050
engineering so what does that mean I

79
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,700
have people that are working for me

80
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,650
right reporting to me that are software

81
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,350
engineers they write code for living

82
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,700
every time we try to walk something down

83
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,410
internally on our network right what do

84
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,549
they do they complain about it because

85
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,190
it takes the more time to do their job

86
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,299
where does that leave me write down have

87
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,010
the balance real world so eventually at

88
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,480
some point someone the more i lock it

89
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,560
down the more likely they are not to

90
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,239
tell me what the door just how it goes

91
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,620
so from a attacker perspective right if

92
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,049
you want to do it flow and flow right if

93
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,640
you want to like just go nice and easy

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,530
right if you say hey I don't need to get

95
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,780
in that network or on that box or on

96
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,010
that server right this second I'm

97
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,260
willing to wait a little bit then some

98
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,970
model looks like this which is let me

99
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,470
figure out what's going on on that

100
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,640
computer what's it look like what

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,650
software is it running what's the policy

102
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,600
in terms of how quickly patches and get

103
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,900
turned around and I can wait because I'm

104
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,730
a bad guy I could wait for potentially a

105
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,620
very long time and then when the time is

106
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,299
right we'll discuss later then I can

107
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,150
move

108
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,769
you don't really have a shot against

109
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:10,060
this so here's these are just some

110
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,310
presents are some stats on Java we all

111
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,079
know job as a problem in terms of I'm

112
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,909
not making any judgment about Java the

113
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,440
runtime of the language of the company

114
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,880
at the separate discussion I'm just

115
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,589
talking about job in terms of how it's

116
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,910
actually deployed in the real world and

117
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,729
and and the issue is is that there are

118
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,860
obviously just based on the stats there

119
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,389
are real holes in Java that occur

120
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:29,830
regularly and have a good regularly over

121
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,449
a very long period of time like what's

122
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,280
measured in decades now right so very

123
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,990
long period of time and it's really hard

124
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,090
to keep the thing up to date I'm not

125
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,440
saying that's because somebody's

126
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,660
incompetent or what practice looking at

127
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,740
the numbers right there's lots of

128
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,880
versions out there and most of them are

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,090
vulnerable to public exploits the world

130
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,919
bottom line that's how it goes like say

131
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,599
for example seventy-seven percent and

132
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:55,020
soon and that's you know in you know our

133
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,099
from carbon black perspective we

134
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,360
sometimes have pretty good visibility

135
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,710
into what's going on in some of our

136
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,320
customer networks and we see numbers all

137
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,849
over the map so I've seen numbers as

138
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,740
well as in the one to two percent range

139
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,740
and that's great and it's high is one

140
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,260
hundred percent right and that hundred

141
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,580
percent is pretty concerning especially

142
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,780
when the Uni go through all the work of

143
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,220
saying hey hey guys are getting

144
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,360
something about this right around right

145
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,710
we're going to do it and you go over two

146
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,970
months right and you finally get all

147
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,560
that gets done and they had it patched

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,240
and then next month you start all over

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,110
again because they didn't

150
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,030
institutionalize any of it right and so

151
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,500
next month we do it all over again so

152
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,979
our problem

153
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,380
yeah it's a lot of stuff right it's a

154
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,360
fancy graph to say there's a lot of

155
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
things this is android and iphone in

156
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,800
particular but the basic gist is it's

157
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,449
more it's just more evidence to support

158
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:42,889
the fact that there's a lot of software

159
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,330
out there self as a lot of lines of code

160
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,680
in it's hard to keep software up to date

161
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,479
it's hard to keep it on your head you

162
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,820
think you out on your head you know

163
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,910
that's that's you that's human nature so

164
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,650
going back to that first slider second

165
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,540
slide where I said something like well

166
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,370
there's targeted right we could be

167
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,139
targeted or we could not be targeted

168
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,970
target of opportunity and then the

169
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,120
asterisks so the idea plain sight is

170
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,190
going to take a little side John here

171
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,650
and talk through let's say I'm a bad guy

172
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,650
you guys the whole audience are tasked

173
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,449
with defending some network I'm trying

174
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,000
to get into it right and my goal of

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,500
course is to steal something right and

176
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,090
let's just say my goal is to steal data

177
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,650
from that sort of all the way over there

178
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,979
looks about like a video camera and I we

179
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,720
all agree right eventually one or

180
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,760
another i'll get into the network but

181
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,349
from my perspective this is just cost

182
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,539
benefit right I just want to get that

183
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,070
data and I want to get that data as

184
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,229
cheaply as i can write as effectively as

185
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,169
i can i could spend a lot of time and

186
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,150
effort to write a whole custom attack

187
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,160
chain right from zero-day exploit all

188
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,870
the way through some sort of data exfil

189
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,820
route get kind of stuff right also it's

190
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,349
a really clever stuff I can I could have

191
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:52,789
eight guys working round the clock

192
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,440
building all that custom tools has never

193
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,300
been seen before and I can lay it down

194
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,530
in this network and you guys have no

195
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,120
chance because no one's ever written a

196
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,289
signature because no one's ever seen in

197
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,180
books I wrote all this just to get into

198
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,789
your network right or I can take some

199
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,710
stuff off the street repurpose it in

200
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,690
three days right if I do a good enough

201
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,130
job of making it look like the public

202
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,110
stuff when you find it you say oh look

203
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,330
at this it's just common grave you know

204
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,340
non-targeted malware no big deal just

205
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,680
reimage the box pull it off their right

206
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,240
and so in that case I got what I wanted

207
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,430
right I got the data I wanted you found

208
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,349
me you had no attribution you had no

209
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:25,130
idea that I'm actually a very

210
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,599
sophisticated very targeted adversary

211
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:29,689
and you chock it up to no big deal

212
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:35,879
except making sense sorry so that's my

213
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,039
bottom line right there in two cliches

214
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,219
so whereas will is away and we know this

215
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,569
is how that works right there's a profit

216
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:43,740
motive somewhere someone figure out how

217
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,960
to exploit it we don't need software

218
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,849
computer security and a net stuff throw

219
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:50,249
it all out human nature there's a will

220
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:51,870
there's a way and then number two

221
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,370
there's more than one way to skin a cat

222
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,960
which is no matter what you're going to

223
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,580
do are in terms of trying to defend your

224
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,499
network you're doing this with a barrel

225
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:00,270
holes in it right and there's always

226
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,860
more popping out somewhere else and the

227
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,840
more tightly you get some stuff be more

228
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,699
attractive it is for the bad guy to go

229
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:14,520
at this some other vector no more so we

230
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,379
know there's public you know as a public

231
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,719
market 40 days of our cut and second

232
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:21,900
he's not a novel pill we know that

233
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,839
there's a lot of ways two more lonely

234
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,219
skin a cat right there's a lot of ways

235
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:28,469
to get onto the network in the first

236
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:31,110
place right so then some of those are

237
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,250
very sophisticated some of those are

238
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,719
extremely unsophisticated we know all

239
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,110
that but even if somehow you managed to

240
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,630
patch everything from Java on up right

241
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,948
and you have all the rules in place and

242
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:43,380
everything is all laid out you still

243
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,050
can't win right you still can't win it's

244
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,029
not going to happen because and around

245
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,470
the attacker again I'm doing cost of my

246
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,449
cost-benefit analysis right and i say i

247
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,880
want to get on this network and what you

248
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,769
have on this network is to me right

249
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,660
we're 250k much sake and you know

250
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,980
because we definitely let's pause for a

251
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,360
second we definitely have a kind of a

252
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,899
case where I'm a technical bad guy right

253
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,519
I've come a hacker I break into things

254
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,510
and so my that's why I know how to do

255
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,089
but I don't myself necessarily want the

256
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:16,589
data that's on that server myself

257
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,019
because all i really want is to write

258
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,269
code and break in to fix but i do want

259
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,890
to pay check right so one way or another

260
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,410
i am contracted by somebody else to go

261
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,930
fetch that right and so when it comes

262
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,230
down to it if i have a Turner 50k payoff

263
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,930
and I fingerprint now look around and I

264
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,459
see that everything's secure and it's

265
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,440
not going to work and say well my 10,000

266
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,450
no plans not going to work

267
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,030
I can go on the zoo at a market pick up

268
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,790
something 100 k pop it up in grab the

269
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,320
data get out I'm still under 50k to

270
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,780
Richard good deal the same way you and I

271
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,490
working up you know with our personal

272
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,170
lives and how everyone works but

273
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,110
cost-benefit analysis so here's the zero

274
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,820
day initiative I'm assuming most of you

275
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,080
familiar with this at least in principle

276
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,660
right you know it's this is just an

277
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,340
example right there's it's not that hard

278
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,070
to still these days right to find things

279
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,440
all the major software vendors have

280
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
become a very very long way I've been

281
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,160
part of that Neil very small part of

282
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,390
that in my career over the years of

283
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,910
trying to bring commercial software

284
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,650
enterprise software forward in terms of

285
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,110
its resiliency to attack there's no way

286
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,460
around the fact that in 10 years the

287
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,430
industry has come a long way but it's

288
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,680
not enough right like it isn't like the

289
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,380
gates are now high enough and in my

290
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,000
opinion this is you know get my opinion

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,620
but I feel like it goes back to if

292
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,030
there's a will there's a way right for

293
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,770
me it's still it's still going to happen

294
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,900
we just keep moving it up but it's a

295
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,690
never-ending race one more for mark so

296
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,610
the name that was highlighted in red

297
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,040
that I passed over so quickly that you

298
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
know just one name at random Google

299
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,340
first hit more

300
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,370
there i'm sorry fourth one more maybe

301
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,810
the same name is not not taking on this

302
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,270
guy but the key is is that there's a

303
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,070
market out there why is there a market

304
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,390
because someone's buying it right

305
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,160
there's a buyer and seller and well why

306
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,530
they want to buy it right was a little

307
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,030
business of governments buying if I

308
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,440
throw them out right let's just worry

309
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,120
about the bag legitimate bad guys in

310
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,440
terms of our perspective in the

311
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,820
commercial world trying to defend

312
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,080
networks why are they buying it because

313
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,940
someone else is paying somebody else to

314
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,770
go get something right and it's worth

315
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,410
the cost to go pick up the buy something

316
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,930
so whenever there's with the cost is the

317
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,280
market means the market people string up

318
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,990
to fill the holes and external fill the

319
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,370
holes they do that wherever its most

320
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,080
cost-effective so they might be in the

321
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,340
United States so they might be overseas

322
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,320
it's just a market one two three four

323
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,550
five thank you so here's some you know

324
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,510
12 ballpark figures on cost right let's

325
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,860
pick a number somewhere in the middle

326
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,760
and say 50k you know market this market

327
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,350
in particular because it is a black

328
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,110
market right it is under the covers a

329
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,880
little bit so therefore it is not a very

330
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,890
efficient market alright so because it's

331
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,540
not easy to you know one hundred percent

332
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,430
easy to kind of match buyers and sellers

333
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,140
there can be some discrepancies and how

334
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,250
much people are paying for the same

335
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,920
thing that's okay we get a quarter of

336
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,080
Magna tree out of this right and these

337
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,820
numbers are not all that I but if for

338
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,310
example non task with defending a

339
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,050
network that has intellectual property

340
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,850
of substance so I'm going to totally

341
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,590
make something up here and say I'm a

342
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,980
drug company and I have some some I'm

343
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,240
not a chemist rights on anything about

344
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,430
this but I have some recipe right for

345
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,010
here's what a drug is here's what here's

346
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,110
will went into it here's the process the

347
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,670
manufacturing process here's learning to

348
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,410
do in order to make it and all of that

349
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,390
is all put together that's worth a lot

350
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,190
of money especially to an overseas

351
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,260
generic drug tag maker that is willing

352
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,570
to flout neo us intellectual property

353
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,030
rules and that's worth way more than two

354
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,010
hundred thousand dollars he's not even

355
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,470
close in the old days I pride all this

356
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,000
stuff how did how did intellectual

357
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,400
property theft like this happen using

358
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,860
the drug example it happened when I'm

359
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,840
the First World drug company I make the

360
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,840
drug somebody in there somebody else

361
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,510
procures the drug

362
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,550
prescription even right I was a couple

363
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,470
biochemist and says hey figure that out

364
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,790
reverse engineer that and they go

365
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,080
through a process and they figure it out

366
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,490
and then they come back six months later

367
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,780
they say hey here's how to make it

368
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,400
alright and then we try to make a but we

369
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,630
have some little steno struggles in the

370
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,280
manufacturing process just like as if

371
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,200
you're making ourselves but now it's a

372
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,940
year later we have it now we can skip

373
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,040
the kemah cell together right just hire

374
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,080
somebody on the black market to go hop

375
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,580
on that server again the server's get a

376
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,580
lot of use and you know pop those tacos

377
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,110
server grab the data bring it all back

378
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,030
now I have the whole process documenter

379
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,500
for me from beginning to end ready to go

380
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,570
ready to use right now if thats $250,000

381
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,920
I'm sorry it's a cost to get that

382
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,590
initial access with right now right not

383
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,390
wait not fingerprint and wait for some

384
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,710
public bone to happen in the in the

385
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,230
batch cycle to not have elapsed yet just

386
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,850
to go right now is only 250 thousand

387
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:05,750
dollars there's no way I think it's

388
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,410
saying the same thing here again cheap

389
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,480
good body covered that same point again

390
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,890
hasn't changed so detection bypass that

391
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,620
will so that's a kind of a bold

392
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,690
statement right so I I for example i'm

393
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,630
in the in the computer security business

394
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,150
so if you if you read that little lady

395
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,590
say what's the point why would we even

396
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,660
have any revenue right if it's all by

397
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,640
will then what's what's the point just

398
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,620
so degree that's that's true right if

399
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,150
the attacker is sufficiently skilled and

400
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,580
sufficiently motivated you got no shot

401
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,350
right so it's kind of like let's draw

402
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,600
the line somewhere so maybe we'll say

403
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,360
that detection passed at will with

404
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,910
motivation right in resources but those

405
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,320
remote elation resources aren't all that

406
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:58,390
high mark ok so for intervention

407
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,120
so okay so let me repeat that because i

408
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,350
learned that once in a speaking class

409
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,180
let's repeat the question so prevention

410
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,370
bypass that will so i'll buy of each in

411
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,680
the middle all of that and will say both

412
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,040
right so prevention can happen because

413
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,650
you have the ability to detect but or

414
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,029
would have the ability to detect if you

415
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,650
knew you've detected even the past tense

416
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,690
to say this class and attacks right is

417
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,580
looks like this so therefore i can put a

418
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,990
safe guard protects against this class

419
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,060
but it assumes that i know what

420
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,320
safeguard i'm putting in place to

421
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,420
protect against now i understand what's

422
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,160
coming at me so that i can put that wall

423
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,960
there if I have no idea that people are

424
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,220
walking through this to all the time I

425
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,750
don't even know to try to prevent

426
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,360
something here I guess I'll meet you the

427
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,630
middle and say generally speaking the

428
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,279
idea that we can say we're going to pull

429
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,750
up the walls we're gonna stop you from

430
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,070
getting in we're gonna know when they

431
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,380
even try is not true at least in the

432
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,800
hundred percent case so here are kind of

433
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,180
like the two core pillars I would say of

434
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,700
modern Network defense and will be very

435
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,650
clear in case I said anything a minute

436
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,360
from now that it's contrary to this that

437
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,670
I'm not saying that both of these don't

438
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,750
have value because they have incredible

439
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,070
better just period middle bottom wat so

440
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,720
when we say host-based antivirus right

441
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,220
we need something on the end point on

442
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,100
the host that is doing something right

443
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,390
there's lots of different ways that it

444
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,830
can be done but broadly we're looking at

445
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,060
some sort of signature that is some

446
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,070
combination of thick static signatures

447
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,740
like these simple as a hash or something

448
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,480
as complicated as some crazy heuristics

449
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,980
that you know three or four PhD type

450
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,500
spent six months right right anywhere in

451
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,780
there well yours are we can say just

452
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,220
look at the packets they're coming and

453
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,140
going right maybe it's a perimeter maybe

454
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,850
on a kind of key internal internal

455
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,560
network kind of spots let's watch things

456
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,870
as they come and go again we can look at

457
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,400
signatures you know that stream of bytes

458
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,990
is bad this true but it looks about like

459
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,520
this in a fuzzy kind of way that's bad

460
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,470
or you can do the kind of thing that's

461
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,670
really neat that people are doing it

462
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,470
last number of years where we say hey

463
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,040
let's let's not even use kind of static

464
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,300
analysis what we'd say on the front

465
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,680
excite static analysis let's not just

466
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,839
carve out some sort of payload off the

467
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,579
wire and just look at it let's actually

468
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,589
pick it up drop it over in

469
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,480
one time some dynamics and sandbox kind

470
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,429
of environment right and make it go and

471
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:15,529
then watch what happens right and if we

472
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,839
do that at that point we have a lot

473
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,669
better understanding maybe maybe if we

474
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:21,169
do it right of whether this thing is

475
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,000
malicious or at least suspicious you

476
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,079
pull that together and that's great

477
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,109
stuff it's great stuff but I don't think

478
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:32,270
it's enough oh sorry if you don't want

479
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,919
the skill I mean not that that's hard to

480
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,980
read but the via the school thing I want

481
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,169
to bring up because it's not it's not a

482
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:41,270
question of whether or not anything that

483
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,890
anyone's doing in the past tense or in

484
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,120
the present tense from the future chance

485
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,799
by any vendor you know myself or anybody

486
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,750
else is whether it is up it's a good

487
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,159
idea in theory the scale thing just

488
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,169
makes it horror right it's the whole

489
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,789
idea of like you have a network device

490
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:55,250
and it does a great job of carving all

491
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,390
this stuff out and all these people

492
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,649
spend all this time writing all this

493
00:17:57,649 --> 00:17:59,360
code to call those stuff online it and

494
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,590
make all these determinations and it's

495
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,000
great work all the way around and you

496
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,419
get 4527 words a day like what do you do

497
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,679
with it right what do you mean way in a

498
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:07,730
practical sense what do you do with that

499
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,840
so just because you have the right idea

500
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,820
and you know what you want to do you

501
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,440
can't actually apply it to the problem

502
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,429
with there in front of you because it's

503
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:16,190
just too big so this is this it just

504
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:22,190
makes everything works right so who

505
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,220
knows where they got that number right

506
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,409
286 million variants wherever that means

507
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,630
I think the key thing is there's a lot

508
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,750
all right there's a lot and it's way too

509
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,760
many to like write down all right I

510
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,169
can't just say well I'm going to click a

511
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:39,169
list of 286 million ashes and then keep

512
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:41,299
it up-to-date somehow and always use it

513
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,710
like it's not gonna happen so this is

514
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,020
fun this is fun so just let's just read

515
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,880
this for a second networks to carry

516
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,080
minor and if you read this I'm not going

517
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,220
to ask you to read it just take my word

518
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,980
for it looks kind of like a lot like

519
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,250
some of the a lot of the network

520
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,570
perimeter devices that on the market

521
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,360
right now no again nothing disparaging

522
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,540
whatsoever but look at the date

523
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,890
1990 so I got cut off in the bottom here

524
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,810
but the interesting thing here is 1989

525
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,860
was the 100,000 you know node with an IP

526
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,710
ride on the internet and 91 if I

527
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,850
remember correctly is one kind of the

528
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,770
internet open to commercialization this

529
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,120
paper was published in the middle that

530
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,460
gives you an idea of how little the

531
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,290
thinking the big picture thinking behind

532
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,000
network network level security has

533
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,560
changed since that time nothing wrong

534
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,450
with that right so as I say all the time

535
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm an engineering after all ideas are

536
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,660
cheap executions expensive but so but

537
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,980
this is where we are and that's the big

538
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,400
question all right so if whatever your

539
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,980
your strategy for trying to offend your

540
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,840
network involves any kind of signature

541
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,630
it's what i fixed signature like a hash

542
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,520
or a fixed signature like these stream

543
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,050
of bytes or extruded bites to meet these

544
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,690
requirements or even something like let

545
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,950
me pull the thing out running the

546
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,960
sandbox executed and then if it does

547
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,370
things have not like this and about like

548
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,780
that and about that order then we'll

549
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,920
call it suspicious any of those

550
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,630
combination right fundamentally though

551
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,400
someone had to come up with an idea that

552
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,520
that is bad and this is good or at least

553
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,140
that is bad and by extension this must

554
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,760
not be bad or at least we don't think

555
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,910
it's bad and it's a real problem I it's

556
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,340
a real problem when someone the bad

557
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,600
person is running it for the first time

558
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,060
there's there's nothing to be done there

559
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,220
right and what makes our field I think

560
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,500
just so fun I know it's not fun we're in

561
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,600
it all day the like in theory fun right

562
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,760
is that it's one of the rare fields

563
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,610
where you have challenges that are

564
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,530
changing but that's common in a lot of

565
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,940
industries right but they're changing

566
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,620
because there's a person on the other

567
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,480
side that's very smart and very

568
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,300
motivated trying to outsmart you right

569
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,890
like again I don't know anything about I

570
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,750
know nothing whatsoever right about the

571
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,060
drug industry you know pharmaceuticals I

572
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,550
know that people who are very very small

573
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,660
work very hard to come up with clever

574
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,730
stuff but fundamentally the chemistry

575
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,010
behind it generally speaking i'm

576
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,200
guessing isn't changing a lot maybe some

577
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,350
of like the you know antiviral and I

578
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,430
achieve anything without like you have

579
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,570
an active agent on the other end is

580
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,220
changing but it's not changing the speed

581
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,510
that humans change right and that's

582
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,080
really neat stuff

583
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:24,200
yeah we know that and that's the bottom

584
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,700
line said another way by somebody who

585
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,330
has more clout than me right so the and

586
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,769
it was even said the past tense so I

587
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,869
can't even say I have any novel idea so

588
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:34,279
the idea though is that I think we have

589
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,840
to come to this conclusion so let's talk

590
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,190
about the time right so what I have here

591
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,840
is like just order magic timeline

592
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,480
obviously compromise in seconds so what

593
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,999
does that mean well that I mean we just

594
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,350
got done saying that the you know the

595
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,389
bad guy might be lying in wait for hours

596
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:55,309
or weeks or months but once the actual

597
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:56,779
attack starts compromise does it take

598
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,549
very long generally that initial toehold

599
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:02,509
into a network quick one step told is

600
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:04,820
achieved data exfiltration so grabbing

601
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,440
up top files and such and pushing them

602
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,090
out can happen quickly does it happen

603
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,859
quickly it depends at the end of the day

604
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:11,179
there are people and processes on the

605
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:12,440
other end right just like we have people

606
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,389
and posses an outside they have people

607
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:16,009
on buses on their side they might have a

608
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:18,169
team that says I'm team one I get

609
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,179
initial execution access endpoint you

610
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:22,070
know I got to hold on that network and

611
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,539
then I pass it off to somebody else

612
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:25,460
right who knows how long it's gonna take

613
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,529
but once they can go that start right

614
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,330
away then it's hard for us to detect

615
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,619
that right if we're lucky we can detect

616
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,570
it right away for lucky the actual

617
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,039
payload that came in was pulled off by

618
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,509
our network device in two minutes after

619
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:37,399
it came in we got you know detective or

620
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,049
unlucky it could be sitting there for

621
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,580
months months and months at a time right

622
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,129
and we know that happens and then trying

623
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,840
to fix it takes a while right just the

624
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,309
act of trying to decide politically

625
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:48,200
organizationally what to do about it you

626
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,429
think you found if you're not quite sure

627
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:51,799
and then what do we do when you pull the

628
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:54,139
whole network offline I'm probably not

629
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,639
right so now we actually have to do

630
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:56,720
something what are we going to do it how

631
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,859
fast you're going to do it who's going

632
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,029
to do it when you get the man party with

633
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:00,830
the subcontract out oh now got stuck in

634
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,119
purchasing right let me know all that

635
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,190
kind of mess right and then I cost a lot

636
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,539
by the time we're done and that's just

637
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:07,850
for one incident if I got 10,000 in

638
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,019
points lying around and i can assume

639
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:10,249
that they're all being attacked numerous

640
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:14,409
times a day that is how it worked

641
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,550
this is a yeah I did making slides don't

642
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:29,920
play me so um what kind of a 2020 way of

643
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,760
saying in my opinion a way of saying if

644
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,170
you come from a background where your

645
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,480
goal is to establish an analogy right a

646
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,430
real world of physical analogy to a

647
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,250
network security problem a pretty common

648
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,550
analogy is some variation of castle moat

649
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,810
gage wall right some sort of you know

650
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,220
protection right and then a good people

651
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,630
are inside and we're hunkering down were

652
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,190
protected and the bad people are outside

653
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,630
barbarians at the gate and they're out

654
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,000
there once you establish that metaphor

655
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,500
it's very hard to break that right

656
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,010
because you think constantly about

657
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,330
raising the wall in some way or another

658
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,910
may make it thicker right or closing

659
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,280
down the size of the holes right besides

660
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,950
the door and that's great and it all

661
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,170
needs to be done but it leaves us

662
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,910
vulnerable mentally to the idea that

663
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,100
that we don't recognize that the Fifth

664
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,720
Column right is already on the inside

665
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,490
and there isn't just one of them so all

666
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,890
over the place and it's that mention

667
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:33,910
just how it is so skip one more if you

668
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,900
don't mind actually so we know what are

669
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,430
the barriers for us being able to

670
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,050
address this kind of problem the

671
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,820
technical barrier is just the barrier to

672
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,590
like come get into the scale problem I

673
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,210
mean at the end of the day even if you

674
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,220
know exactly what you want to do you

675
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,440
can't just stare a cat5 cable and and

676
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,090
and figure it out right you need some

677
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,830
sort of you need some sort of tools and

678
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,900
software and over and stuff right to

679
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,440
help make sense of all that data there's

680
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,700
some legal constraints I'm going to make

681
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,780
that just bigger and say political

682
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,980
constraints you know what you want to do

683
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,600
you know exactly you want to end your

684
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,820
right and your budget is one-tenth of

685
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,900
what you need to be to even think about

686
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,630
doing it right and time is a variation

687
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,650
of the other thing right no one has

688
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,730
enough time on principle

689
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,200
mark alright so this is my next kind of

690
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,260
um I guess assertion right and my

691
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,210
assertion is is that because i don't

692
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,560
know this i don't have a i don't have

693
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,860
like a insider view of what every

694
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,600
organizations budget is looking like but

695
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,900
but from my experience and from some of

696
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,000
their data points that we dug up it

697
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,580
seems like the balance and that 0% is

698
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,790
obviously excessive I for the balance of

699
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,260
effort in terms of dollars in time and

700
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,490
everything that's going into this whole

701
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,710
process of Defense is moving to the fall

702
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,960
left as we call it on prevention and

703
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,270
that initial detection that initial

704
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,640
detection of some sort of exploit or the

705
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,080
delivery of a zip file some sort of

706
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,060
malicious software in it or exotic

707
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,740
cetera right that initial catch let's

708
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,990
try that we focus on that wall that

709
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,910
initial cut and after that we fade off

710
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,340
pretty fast and we think about it you

711
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,560
know you buy a a couple you know network

712
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,110
from their devices you know at 50 k each

713
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,510
right and then you buy some antivirus

714
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,070
software and you're paying 50k for that

715
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,600
and you have three or four people that

716
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,460
are you know tasks all day every day

717
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,260
with kind of maintaining all that let's

718
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,030
say that i'll make an ATK each right you

719
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,260
must all that together and that could

720
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:32,020
spray big chunk of money so my basic

721
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,410
argument is is that when we fear here

722
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,810
right i'm not saying that that money is

723
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,720
wasted i'm not saying anything here i'm

724
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,000
just saying though that by putting all

725
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,880
the effort there to the left you were

726
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,800
putting blinders on our ability to see

727
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,770
what's going on already right and i'm

728
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,780
not even sure what the right thing to do

729
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,040
is because if you open up your eyes and

730
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,480
you find a bunch of bad stuff we don't

731
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,790
have any way to deal with it so what

732
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,410
right now you know if you have more bad

733
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,670
news you go home in a week and you feel

734
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,200
more stressed and so can't change

735
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,180
anything so it's not as easy as just

736
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,500
saying well just move the minor right

737
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,120
everything goes way on their hand the

738
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,920
first I feel like the first thing to

739
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,710
kind of recognize is if you if you view

740
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,450
the world like this then you realize

741
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,460
that it's got at least get flattened a

742
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,630
little bit team out of shot

743
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:29,700
that's right what work so I mean

744
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,080
playback win by the way back when I mean

745
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,649
about 10 years ago on a personal note

746
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:37,779
right I had not been in the I've been a

747
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:40,200
software business right for not in the

748
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,549
security business so I got microsoft for

749
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:43,990
example I worked on me stunningly

750
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,120
successful wildly popular Windows Media

751
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,139
drm team so digital rights management

752
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:54,700
right and not only that I was not on the

753
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,590
core team has ever been to cool and set

754
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,120
all this on the special team that was

755
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,130
trying to port that the portable devices

756
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,320
like cell phones this is back in like

757
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,539
2001 and that was so wildly successful

758
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:05,950
that you're all using that technology

759
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,309
today so the part was that written

760
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,320
software you know some you know big

761
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,519
companies small companies I've been in

762
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,500
that line of work and then all of a

763
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,389
sudden through kind of a twist of fate

764
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:18,070
on my personal side to end up doing this

765
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,750
network security assessment kind of

766
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,309
stuff in a blew my mind right it blew my

767
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:23,320
mind I remember the first time I went in

768
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,909
an assessment this is about to accept I

769
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:26,139
was hired I you know it is two weeks

770
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:27,460
into a new job you don't know first

771
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,710
thing from anything i sat down next to

772
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,090
someone who'd been there five or six

773
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,549
years and he was using wireshark this is

774
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:35,340
the coolest thing in the world readily

775
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,440
because I've done socket programming for

776
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,480
years right and i knew in principle I'll

777
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,250
tcp work but I've never seen a

778
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,350
visualization of a packet ever right in

779
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,580
the fact you could see lighter you could

780
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,320
like right click and filter and it was

781
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,029
just this is the whole world's right

782
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,710
here and then you find out there's tools

783
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,480
that can see inside of our operating

784
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,100
system like windows you would say like

785
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,539
the sysinternals tools right like look

786
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:56,620
at that time right there you just don't

787
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,730
want to run it and you can suddenly

788
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,960
discover all the stuff that you see a

789
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,789
black box and then you start figuring

790
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:01,750
out and this is how you take advantage

791
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,820
of that in order to do know bad things

792
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,980
and so of course we want to do all this

793
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,149
stuff so I don't do this stuff anymore

794
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:08,679
but you know you want to do all this

795
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,840
stuff em at the very least you know the

796
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,850
real key here and this is the again it's

797
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,549
a hard part particularly for management

798
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:18,309
to make right is you actually you're

799
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:20,230
really focused on trying to get results

800
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,549
that are reflective of what your actual

801
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:23,590
problems are right and there's kind of a

802
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,590
natural counter incentive because if you

803
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,240
go through you pay the hundred thousand

804
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,600
bucks for the assessment and you get

805
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,250
Becca hey guys did pretty well you want

806
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,330
to fix up that you want to fix up that

807
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,440
other than that you're good then never

808
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,390
go home and feel happy laughs you didn't

809
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,429
solve the damn pro and and so you kind

810
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:39,140
of have to be motivated to say dig

811
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,910
deeper be self-critical and go forget a

812
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,160
stuff out and that's hard is it's not

813
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,480
lined up with what you actually want to

814
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,470
do in terms of making your job easier

815
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:53,980
one more I'm gonna doing that time

816
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:00,080
plenty of times all right good so let's

817
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,340
walk through the bad guy who knows

818
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,200
another little bad guy I'm gonna walk

819
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,640
through this I didn't make this graph

820
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,470
and then I'm gonna walk through it again

821
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,360
and then kind of show you that it's it's

822
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,539
a worse than it sounds even so we send

823
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:13,220
something let's just go to zip file

824
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,880
throw it on a common remote access tool

825
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,080
number three their lateral movement

826
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,520
there's actually kind of two levels in

827
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,870
that particular ball there's kind of

828
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,289
gain admin or gain root I am a local box

829
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,610
and then spread out a little bit right

830
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,020
so now you have up to hold on more one

831
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,230
box but then you find some data that's

832
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,630
number four funds and data exfiltrated

833
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,460
and then it's gone all right it's

834
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,720
actually even easier than that because

835
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,610
you don't really even always need to do

836
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,840
this part right because cost-benefit

837
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,179
analysis right from the bad guy I can

838
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,010
create a sophisticated rootkit that's

839
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,690
advanced and persistent alright so it's

840
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,070
going to stick around as the Box reboots

841
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,770
55 times i can write or i can just send

842
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,140
an email again right well i can just act

843
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,799
quickly right and do i need admin on my

844
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,080
box well no because what is all my data

845
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,270
on the CFO of my organization where's

846
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,799
all my data does it lock down so it only

847
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,870
admin can read it obviously not because

848
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,460
then I have to be I'm in an orderly go

849
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,990
on the box that's all to do is go to my

850
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,250
like an instructor dolly they do is go

851
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,970
to the z drive say door door star

852
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,370
interesting star enter for each send it

853
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,559
out I don't need any I need any kind of

854
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,030
call access I don't anything special

855
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,010
right and I already have all the data

856
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,900
that's all you guys remember the whole

857
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,820
internet explorer with this then it had

858
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,740
the low rights mode you know I mean by

859
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,030
that right kind of dropped itself down

860
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,770
so that you couldn't write to your

861
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,909
personal you know your my documents

862
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:33,770
directory and that's a good thing I'm

863
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,210
not blaming Microsoft for that at all

864
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,860
it's a good thing but it's kind of a

865
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,390
side the point from an exultation point

866
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,740
of view because you still have read

867
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,380
access

868
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,060
but you know you saw every axis because

869
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,740
you go to gmail and say attached right

870
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,970
and you can go to your directory and

871
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,730
pull up and so it's it's really not that

872
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:53,190
hard right it's really not that hard so

873
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,930
there's the detection and this is the

874
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,300
hard part right and again for an

875
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,560
attacker point of view this could happen

876
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,470
very very quickly once this happens you

877
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,890
can you know go by a long time um you

878
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,480
can do something sophisticated with

879
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,620
advanced persistent you know very

880
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,630
sophisticated like lay down a whole

881
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,910
series of rickets on 25 boxes that have

882
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,290
never before been seen right and even

883
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,430
the most advanced anti-rootkit

884
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,110
technology can't find it theoretically

885
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,000
right or let's say you have roaming

886
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,160
profiles on your organization reasonable

887
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,080
bet right I could copy and that's Q

888
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,960
which is a startup folder right copy

889
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,850
copy pile right there it is and then

890
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,100
whenever I login anywhere when profile

891
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,750
comes with it and it starts up but

892
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,370
that's not sophisticated it cost me

893
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,370
maybe 18 seconds of coding right and it

894
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,730
works sorry yeah go to have the iceberg

895
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,460
hello the day pretty good so yeah and

896
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,410
you see all that so bottom line right we

897
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,870
agree that we have to detect I mean

898
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,920
everyone agrees that right we can't just

899
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,330
pretend we're not gonna look at it on

900
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,830
the other hand we have to say that's

901
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,630
just starting it's just the tip of the

902
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,070
iceberg right it's just the beginning we

903
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,149
have to keep going from that point

904
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:09,360
oh one more hopefully song in red comes

905
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,730
up it will remind me what I'm doing

906
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:16,559
right this this one right here so when

907
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,200
you're in the business of you know

908
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,789
you're doing your best to prevent and

909
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,019
detect you're doing your best you're

910
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:22,980
doing your best you're doing the best

911
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,659
but you messed up once in a while but

912
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:25,860
maybe because the tools weren't good

913
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,629
enough probably or maybe because you got

914
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:28,710
lazy and didn't show up for work for

915
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,600
three days probably right you know any

916
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,559
number of things right but eventually

917
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,960
somebody gets in maybe you're doing your

918
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,159
job as best you can you just you don't

919
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,529
have enough of you write or maybe you're

920
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,269
just outsmarted right which is not a ton

921
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:40,830
of shame right the other person on the

922
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,539
other end is highly intelligent highly

923
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,549
motivated dozens for a living now you're

924
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:45,779
trying to fend this breath they're

925
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,509
attacking like this when you find out

926
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:50,249
something happen you think oh no that

927
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:52,289
computer over there we're pretty sure

928
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:54,600
that's been compromised so all we know

929
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,429
all these computers are compromised but

930
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:57,509
we merely know that this one's

931
00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:01,110
compromised what do we do right and the

932
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,940
answer is is that of course you can go

933
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,259
and clean it but if you actually want to

934
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:05,940
figure out what happened oftentimes

935
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,679
you're stuck with file system forensics

936
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,879
right which would be something like take

937
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,710
the box off line pull the drive out make

938
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,989
a copy and then either you have in-house

939
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,969
expertise or you don't if you don't

940
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,109
you're kind of out of luck is now you're

941
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:17,520
paying someone reasonable amount per

942
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,989
hour right for somebody very motivated

943
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:21,139
very smart but true size matters reader

944
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,418
take apart bit by bit and try to use you

945
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,429
know expensive software to analyze a

946
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,530
disk to hopefully find out some trace of

947
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,690
what happened maybe months ago right and

948
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,010
they might find it they might not it

949
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,270
might find something and think they have

950
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,379
it but that might be wrong because all

951
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:35,699
the data was there not their fault right

952
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,259
etc etc it's very cumbersome

953
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,500
so what do you do to get prepared when

954
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,540
your answer is look for the detection

955
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,679
you're trying to detect it on first

956
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,379
access missed it then wait months until

957
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:49,940
it smacks you in the face and then try

958
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,230
to go back and look at what's on the

959
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,399
disk that hopefully is going to recreate

960
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,989
the steps from seven months ago till now

961
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:56,060
right that's what I'm saying is like a

962
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,460
common kind of workflow so what can we

963
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,810
do with that what's better than that

964
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,190
that's reasonable all right so this

965
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:09,650
makes sense this is good stuff all right

966
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,390
I don't actually drink it but I'm a

967
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,950
software guy so I ought to be drinking

968
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,160
Mountain Dew right so via Leah that's

969
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,619
the good stuff and then next and then he

970
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,359
that's your network that's you're trying

971
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:23,180
to fend and this right well here well

972
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,680
networked offenders right this is our

973
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,700
view of our network and the key is

974
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,710
what's right back there right what's

975
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,390
right we're on that I'll right where you

976
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,920
can't see no no no excellent that's not

977
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,880
actually the same picture because I

978
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,910
can't find two things on google but just

979
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,500
what would mate right the keys is that

980
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,210
if you only got eyes from one place

981
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,220
right if you only have high-level eyes

982
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,780
from one place you're only going to see

983
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,700
some some subset of it if you have

984
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,250
cameras called-out camino there in the

985
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,830
top right everywhere right then you can

986
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,619
see more places not novel right not

987
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:58,970
clever

988
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,340
so then I get my one slide pitch right

989
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,870
which is in and will not the only

990
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,730
company doing this but the idea that the

991
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,110
basic argument that I'm making is is

992
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,850
that just like you want a network

993
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,010
primitive device to watch all the bites

994
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,870
flowing in and out and make some action

995
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,440
I argument is is that you also want some

996
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,060
sort of visibility into what's going on

997
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,860
your host if you treat your host like a

998
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,860
black box it's a problem but if you say

999
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,480
well I'll just look at the bikes going

1000
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,060
to and fro and that will be enough it

1001
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,680
isn't right and if you say well

1002
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,360
something went wrong with that box I'll

1003
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,440
pull it off line and do the whole

1004
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,510
fathers in forensics that's problem too

1005
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,760
because he takes a long time it's very

1006
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,870
tedious is very expensive and it's

1007
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,370
ultimately incomplete through no fault

1008
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,230
of the discipline your no fault of the

1009
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,700
people doing it but just because that

1010
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,400
data is not always there the disk is not

1011
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,110
an infinite store of everything that

1012
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,290
ever happened all the time right so we

1013
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,850
need some sort of additional visibility

1014
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,400
into that what is that going to give us

1015
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,500
nothing right just more data at first

1016
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,660
right and you're the client data but

1017
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,690
it's the first step to having that data

1018
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,010
to be able to manipulate it and slice it

1019
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,780
and dice it and cut and look for trends

1020
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,880
to allow you some sort of visibility

1021
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,950
that you can act on and the big

1022
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,330
difference here is is that there's no

1023
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,490
difference you could walk to the

1024
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,350
computer or rdp to it or whatever but

1025
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,240
and overwrite your own little script you

1026
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,830
Spears executive honor right you can do

1027
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,120
all that you can say what's going on

1028
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,440
that computer right now what's going on

1029
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,730
that computer right now you can run all

1030
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,240
that but it's very painstaking right

1031
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,640
takes you a long time and then when you

1032
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,100
run all what are you going to run so you

1033
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,210
have an idea I think well I'm going to

1034
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,530
look to see if there's a process named

1035
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,710
bad way a bad guy DXE right I'm gonna

1036
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,150
look so I'm gonna write your script nut

1037
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,430
takes you call two hours right any like

1038
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,520
I'd like to run it but the IT guys like

1039
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,840
I love me so I got sneak in the back

1040
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,130
door with this piece exact thing I have

1041
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,690
going on cuz i have domain admin that I

1042
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,100
didn't tell them about and so then you

1043
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,690
run it across the whole thing right and

1044
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,850
you get back all your results and you

1045
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,410
take a look and you putz Ron you know

1046
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,850
these false positives and you go throw

1047
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,470
that and then I met with you to another

1048
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:57,410
two days and you say though that wasn't

1049
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,270
a good idea right i mean it's not you

1050
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,920
didn't know it took you all that time

1051
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,450
all that friction all that scale just to

1052
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,580
find out that it wasn't a great idea now

1053
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,200
you want to refine your idea because i

1054
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,820
wasn't bad that AC i was looking for

1055
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,710
looking for bad one dot exe now I could

1056
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,880
do it all over again across another two

1057
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,869
days so the rule requires

1058
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:14,450
how can we compress all that down so

1059
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,190
when you have an idea something unique

1060
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,930
to your organization how can you just

1061
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,849
look and see what's going on and and

1062
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:21,829
find out right away is that happening

1063
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:23,420
how is it happening was the character is

1064
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,559
eight characteristics of how it's

1065
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,970
happening let me refine my own

1066
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,259
understanding of my own environment and

1067
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:29,119
you already do that on the network right

1068
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,619
to some degree depending on you know how

1069
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:32,029
involved you are in your perimeter

1070
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:34,099
devices but you have that disability and

1071
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:37,730
you have that actionability argument is

1072
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,630
you want to look at that on the other

1073
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:45,680
side as well oh sorry one back one so

1074
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,150
push traditional forensics way to the

1075
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,490
right but by that what I mean is is the

1076
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,230
idea is that instead of jumping directly

1077
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,900
from I didn't detect it then I grant

1078
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,160
it's smack me in the face so I had no

1079
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,779
choice but to acknowledge it and then go

1080
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:58,549
right to the palaces in forensics let's

1081
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:00,170
try that file system for Zeke has its

1082
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,369
place there's no way around it it will

1083
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:02,720
always be around because it will always

1084
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,819
be a needed discipline but if you push

1085
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:06,740
it to the right but what about pushing

1086
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,029
to the right what I mean I guess is that

1087
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:11,349
is that you're reserving it for four

1088
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,519
more desperate cases right you're

1089
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,619
reserving it for times when another set

1090
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,880
of capabilities that you have now in

1091
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,859
front of that can be used instead so you

1092
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:20,329
say hey let me ask the question quickly

1093
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:22,789
easily and cheaply closed in terms of

1094
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:24,769
time and money and then if it doesn't

1095
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:26,569
give me all the data I need yes now i

1096
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:28,880
need to go go call the disk at least

1097
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,710
make that the last resort instead of the

1098
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,470
first approach i think i'm just about

1099
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:43,190
done so i think that's probably it that

1100
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,960
last point the best forensics is those

1101
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,369
that are not needed right again we're

1102
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:47,720
never going to add my argument we're

1103
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,099
never in get to the point in practical

1104
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:50,539
terms where you say oh yeah we don't

1105
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:52,849
need forensics anymore right it's never

1106
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,009
going to happen but less often you need

1107
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:57,859
them that implies the either a you're

1108
00:39:57,859 --> 00:39:59,660
completely blinded and don't want to

1109
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,519
acknowledge anything right or it means

1110
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,960
you're saying i have enough data i have

1111
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,369
enough tools i have enough capability

1112
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,200
that I don't need to resort to that

1113
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,359
right I can more easily go back and use

1114
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:10,160
some other set of data to answer the

1115
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,329
questions I need to figure out ahead of

1116
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:14,390
time I think that should be just about

1117
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,400
it that's it

1118
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,210
so I think I've 42 minutes in look at

1119
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,569
that yep so you guys have two options

1120
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:26,809
from my perspective you can leave and

1121
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,569
not listen to many more or you can ask

1122
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:32,480
questions I'm good either way so thanks

1123
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,529
for listening i appreciate the time
