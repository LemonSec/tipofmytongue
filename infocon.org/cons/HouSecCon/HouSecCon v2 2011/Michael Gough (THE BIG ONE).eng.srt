1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,730
and gentlemen is it's the it's that time

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,680
it's ten-thirty we want to begin our

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,809
next presentation as you can see from

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,420
the screen there's been a small change

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,930
unfortunately we had a speaker who could

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,900
no longer make it or uncontrollable

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,600
circumstances but so we've shifted the

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,090
schedule around a bit I'd like to

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,090
introduce Michael golf who is going to

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,550
present to us a topic the big one okay

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,399
no it's not exactly the zombie

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,019
apocalypse but it's bad enough if it

13
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:41,139
happens okay michael is a cissp ciss a

14
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:44,989
well-qualified he's discovered

15
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:47,929
significant vulnerabilities he's going

16
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:50,059
to tell us all about what to do when the

17
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:54,199
really bad thing happens Michael Sun

18
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:02,749
everybody except josh anybody want me to

19
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:05,869
use the mic all right oh that's right

20
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,530
reporting all right that's definitely

21
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,650
louder you can hear me okay Greg can you

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,150
speak louder Greg if I know you you're

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,460
going to get picked on I'm sorry so

24
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,890
anyway my name is Michael golf how many

25
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,890
people here are aware of the data

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,630
exposure that happened with the Texas

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,550
Comptroller ah quite a few you well I'm

28
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,590
the poor unfortunate soul that had to

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,090
take this information to my boss and

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,500
he's here somewhere sitting in the

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,250
audience so that's a little bit about me

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,409
know if you go searching for me just

33
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:47,060
remember hacker hurricanes a blog that I

34
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,650
right and I'm not Batman's butler

35
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,960
Dumbledore no relation to these people

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,180
either darn it but the thing I want to

37
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,460
talk about is the fact that being used

38
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,080
to be a consultant HP so I was involved

39
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,140
with some very large incidents with nhp

40
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,460
but also recently with the Texas

41
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,729
Comptroller we had an incident and an

42
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,850
interesting one and the thing that we

43
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,889
kind of fail to look at what we talk

44
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,170
about instant response is what happens

45
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,409
when it becomes emotional when logic

46
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,310
goes out the window

47
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,980
and emotion takes over when rationality

48
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,360
goes out the window and people become

49
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,630
irrational the big one will change the

50
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,739
game within you big time in your company

51
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,790
we have to make some assumptions here

52
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,290
clearly I'm not going to waste your time

53
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,520
about all the stuff that you should

54
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,019
already know if you don't know about

55
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,670
some of the stuff then go out and find

56
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,099
it but one area here data loss TV Norg

57
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,720
good place to do the research for the

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,700
statistics but I have to assume you know

59
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,840
these things because I really want to

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,110
focus at you have all this stuff so what

61
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,170
happens when the big one hits hey

62
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,120
everybody knows about Sony right

63
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,980
everybody knows about Sony the takeaway

64
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,140
here is if you look at the slides down

65
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,750
at the bottom here Sony was at $36 when

66
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,510
it started and it's still going actually

67
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,790
as we know but basically when verrico

68
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,860
did this it had dropped a third of its

69
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,830
value that's significant economy some of

70
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,230
some of that but the reality is this was

71
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,620
huge for Sony game changer no actually

72
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,739
pun intended it would have been there

73
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,739
but funny too later so yes bad press how

74
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,660
many people here will admit to having

75
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,060
been involved with something that got

76
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,299
press or had a bad breach so yeah

77
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,250
there's there's at least three of us in

78
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,100
here this this stuff is what drives our

79
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,930
management crazy it's the stuff we're

80
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,400
under estimating it's the stuff we're

81
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,109
not putting in incident response plans

82
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,140
we can't possibly imagine how people

83
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,329
will your management will react and bad

84
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,370
press is really a bad thing but I want

85
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,780
to talk also about the fact that hey

86
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,910
we're number one but someone did remind

87
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,010
me that recently somebody lost a car and

88
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,350
it had some CDs and there might then 4

89
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,030
million records in there so we might not

90
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,859
be number one anymore but at the time

91
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,600
here at least for a few weeks ago or a

92
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,430
month ago the texas comptroller did

93
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,950
become the largest data exposure in

94
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,510
texas with three and a half million

95
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,540
records and the unfortunate cause of

96
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,600
events that followed and yes bad press

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,850
deal with the fact that I definitely

98
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,380
underestimated going to work for a

99
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,600
elected official and what they might do

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,820
in the event that a that an incident of

101
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,639
that nature to this magnitude occurred

102
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,050
but clearly bad press was something we

103
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,010
read every day your management will not

104
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,080
react quite like you think they

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,870
would when this occurs but wait the

106
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,000
government will save us so if you don't

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,530
know about this they are working on a

108
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,389
data breach law now if those familiar

109
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,580
with those are California been dealing

110
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,520
with this for a while data breach laws

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,349
are great and Danny and all and I just

112
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:47,569
like we heard MJ talk about the fact

113
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,250
that HIPAA requires you to disclose this

114
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,169
information but the feds want to make

115
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:54,669
everybody do it so do you think maybe

116
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,930
there might be some bearing of

117
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,060
information that may be some companies

118
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,960
will hide some stuff I think so and so

119
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,669
we're going to talk about what happens

120
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,969
so what will you do well clearly you're

121
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,680
going to start updating your resume how

122
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,629
many people here really feel the fear

123
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:14,210
that if this occurs update your resume

124
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,009
at first you're going to thank God we're

125
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:16,940
going to work through it we're going to

126
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,190
get through it remember rationality

127
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,719
becomes irrational I'm stealing this

128
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:24,319
from a colleague and clearly logic goes

129
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,599
out the window and becomes a motion how

130
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,639
management will react will blow your

131
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,629
mind because really what we think we've

132
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,219
become we're just become security

133
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:35,900
professionals become scapegoats if

134
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,150
something like Sony hackers or in the

135
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,330
case of was involved with me people lose

136
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,789
their jobs and it wasn't even their

137
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:45,469
fault so really we're scapegoats for

138
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:47,270
something that probably a we told you

139
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,210
existed and be already asked for budget

140
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,919
and see there was no money or you didn't

141
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,969
give it to us so really what will you do

142
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,349
so knowing this that you might be fired

143
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,419
of your scapegoat well you even tell

144
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:00,949
management how many people here live

145
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,710
with that fear I definitely know where

146
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,330
I've come from they definitely live with

147
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,210
that fear and if you tell them will you

148
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,819
get terminated so we got it we got to

149
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,099
take this into account no management

150
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:17,000
what about management well clearly

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,319
management's going to take the approach

152
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,699
I didn't have any relations that

153
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,080
circuitry person right first they're

154
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,610
going to deny it they're not going to

155
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,990
take ownership they're not going to take

156
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,580
responsibility this is the first big

157
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,639
mistake okay I'm sorry but the top has

158
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,729
to immediately say my bad so that's

159
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,379
something we got to keep in mind they're

160
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:35,690
also very much me me me me right because

161
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,710
all they're really worried about is the

162
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,680
bonus they want to make sure that the

163
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,630
Sony stock drop and all the options go

164
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,639
along with that

165
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,039
not occur to them so again the seven

166
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,689
stages denial anger blah blah blah

167
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,460
they're going to go through it and you

168
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,009
are going to be deep in it and you're

169
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,120
going to go home at night shaking your

170
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,990
head going what is going on here and of

171
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,460
course famous saying that a friend of

172
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,279
mine likes to say when in danger or in

173
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,509
doubt run around and scream and shout

174
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:04,180
boy we definitely saw a lot of this and

175
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,449
of course you're fired that's what

176
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,509
management will do so how would

177
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,249
management act if you disclose the

178
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:15,909
breach of the size of Sony TJX Heartland

179
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:18,310
or the Texas Comptroller has anybody

180
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,289
even discussed this with management I

181
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:21,520
want to see a show of hands does anybody

182
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,219
even said hey we need to talk about what

183
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,110
would happen you know let's talk about

184
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,729
these breaches how would it affect our

185
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,800
company how can I even get to the point

186
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,090
that I start talking to you about this

187
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,900
subject because this is the big one I

188
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,460
mean it hasn't happened to us i'm not

189
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,389
going to worry about it it's probably

190
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,150
the reaction you know how you respond

191
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,009
and i think all of us can relate to the

192
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,779
fact that the little yellow sign is

193
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,240
probably the reality of what our

194
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,310
management would do right I don't want

195
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,139
to know about it and I'm not going to do

196
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,210
anything about it until I see my name in

197
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,469
the papers or worse and of course once

198
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,149
that occurs nothing gets their attention

199
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:00,599
more especially elected officials and

200
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,039
CEOs companies when you get your name in

201
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,020
the paper Sony lost a third of their

202
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,599
stock value I'm surprised I did not read

203
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,719
about some CEOs at Sony some he owes of

204
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,639
some sort to an Harry Caray or something

205
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,979
because man that was bad that was really

206
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:17,319
bad the interesting thing about Sony is

207
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,789
apparently there's a lawsuit going on

208
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,399
where Sony actually terminated a bunch

209
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,990
of security people that were doing

210
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,729
internet security presence just before

211
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,919
this occurred now does that mean there

212
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,180
was some inside information that they

213
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,560
know this already occurred so they wiped

214
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,779
everybody out before it released don't

215
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,820
know no probably to look to the lawsuits

216
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,190
completed and of course the Comptroller

217
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,979
has a reputation she's you know well

218
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,809
known she's well-liked she potentially

219
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,190
is going to run for additional office

220
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,410
this is a bummer this is tarnishing her

221
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,310
reputation and again your CEOs or your

222
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,399
CFOs who might become CEOs are going to

223
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,390
react to this kind of situation

224
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,610
and will they make it worse over they

225
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,410
make it manageable Utz of security

226
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,090
professionals have to think about this

227
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,860
and realize we have all the plan in

228
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,950
place but this incident is going to

229
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,920
definitely change things I'm going about

230
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,370
you so let's talk about what you can do

231
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,110
first off we all have to understand what

232
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,090
our company has a lot of times I've

233
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,770
heard is a consultant with HP we don't

234
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,020
have anything anybody wants oh yes you

235
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,930
do you have resources if you're a cloud

236
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,760
provider like the company I work for now

237
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,130
we have resources if somebody got ahold

238
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,230
of one of our Amazon instances there's a

239
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,670
lot of juice lot of horsepower a lot of

240
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,350
CPUs there they can do a lot with it

241
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,150
there's nothing in there that you may

242
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,520
need but that device is something they

243
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,120
want reputation political we see what

244
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,650
obviously lolz sex been doing in

245
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,330
attacking sites we now hurt anonymous is

246
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,880
going after the cartel that's hackers

247
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,410
going after drug people that's that's an

248
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,270
interesting thing to think about so you

249
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,640
really have to figure out what it is and

250
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,160
again I would have probably never put

251
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,620
the Comptroller's reputation down as

252
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,140
something that I would have really said

253
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,750
is a key asset but it really is so we

254
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,100
have to start considering these kinds of

255
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,470
things because that reactions which

256
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,760
you're trying to avoid you're trying to

257
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,110
make sure that she can maintain

258
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,110
political office or he or whoever you

259
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,780
work for so really figure out what that

260
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,010
is get everybody to agree what that is

261
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,300
have you discussed these kinds of things

262
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,980
I talked about this before but this is

263
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,530
something you need to do we need to get

264
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,960
to the point as professionals to say

265
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,240
look management we got to talk about

266
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,460
this we need to start talking about this

267
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,760
now so in the event it happens we're not

268
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,560
surprised and we're not completely

269
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,660
emotionally reaction reacting here and

270
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,400
we're not irrational we've actually

271
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,810
thought about this a little bit so at

272
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,790
least it's in our minds hopefully maybe

273
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,650
even down on paper if you go far enough

274
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,190
that would be really good and yes train

275
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,530
management we do security awareness

276
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,000
training right we all try to train our

277
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,730
users but what about the reactors when

278
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,880
something goes boom and hey I think TG

279
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,220
ex was really clever they spent a lot of

280
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,960
money or plan to spend a lot of money to

281
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,210
fix their issues realized after giving

282
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,590
out these thirty thirty dollar discount

283
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,930
coupons which were transferable so if I

284
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,830
got one and didn't want

285
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,280
use it I could give it to Josh that they

286
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,260
suddenly saw an increase in stock

287
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,450
because everybody's like ooh discount

288
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,820
coupon let's go spend so from their

289
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,140
perspective whoever came up with this

290
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,450
idea marketing wise to deal with a big

291
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,480
one was clever because clearly it would

292
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,130
diffuse internally what happened and

293
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,690
they didn't end up spending a lot of

294
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,130
money on the improvements they were told

295
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,010
they needed so again you talk about this

296
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,500
ahead of time you might think about what

297
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,630
you could do to prevent management from

298
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,980
freaking out role-based awareness

299
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,990
training we talked about it I so says we

300
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,250
have to do it and this says we have to

301
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,960
do it everybody says we have to do it

302
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,520
but do we has anybody here have

303
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,230
management role based training show

304
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,720
hands anybody nobody's raising their

305
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,870
hands so why is it management a role

306
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,830
incident management something we have to

307
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,540
do they are a role in incident

308
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,550
management yeah lower management lower

309
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,500
management no we need to get to upper

310
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,660
management role training here we need to

311
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,300
get them to start thinking about this we

312
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,040
don't want the train wreck to occur we

313
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,480
want them to start thinking about in

314
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,220
this case a retailer saying thirty

315
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,350
dollar coupon ooh that would really

316
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,530
diffuse things because the people who

317
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,130
stop buying from you AKA Sony or even

318
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,470
worse Netflix what they just went

319
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,670
through right just been the fact that

320
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,470
they tried to raise the rates and split

321
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,640
the service oh we're not splitting the

322
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,500
service they got to think about this

323
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,410
stuff before you execute so you can kind

324
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,380
of mitigate the scenario and again why

325
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,970
is important not to drop the axe before

326
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,310
incident management can fully take hold

327
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,440
if you start firing people before you've

328
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,210
completed your work you're going to lose

329
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,930
a lot of talent and for those of us who

330
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,630
are security researchers there's an

331
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,830
interesting side effect of being a

332
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,690
security researcher which we saw from

333
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,150
down unda patrick webster if you're not

334
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,130
familiar with what happened there he he

335
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,020
found a system that did some invoicing

336
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,610
him and a friend happened to be looking

337
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,610
at it saw some information in the URL so

338
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,990
do if I change us to number two or

339
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,510
whatever he did and he got his friends

340
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,880
invoice information he would oh so they

341
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,470
wrote a script they harvested about 500

342
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,760
records and realized oh crap these

343
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
people have an issue and like good

344
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,090
researchers and security professionals

345
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,400
they reported it and of course the

346
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,360
company said thank you thank you thank

347
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,100
you we really appreciate that few days

348
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,720
later

349
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,430
the government shows up at his door the

350
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,810
authorities show up and orton says you

351
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,370
are in trouble they tried to press

352
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,019
charges against a researcher for

353
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,410
harvesting 500 records when reality he

354
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,389
did the right thing but what happens

355
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:35,920
when you do that people start to talk

356
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,329
people have already left the company

357
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:38,800
when this problem was originally

358
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,139
discovered things got blown out of

359
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,509
proportion and one thing we know for

360
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:45,220
sure I can tell you for sure I

361
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,519
experienced this in my data exposure was

362
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,220
people talk once they leave there was

363
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,319
things I saw in the press that there's

364
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,629
no way anybody else knew except the

365
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:57,879
people in this room and that really

366
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,319
concerned me because that means there's

367
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:02,199
some anger people trying to in the case

368
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,970
of the Comptroller CPA was just trying

369
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,920
to see why a steal that from a friend of

370
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,829
mine so keep that in mind I'll really

371
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,209
cooperate like the car key vendor I'm

372
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,949
doing your presentation with Ian after

373
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:14,439
lunch about a card key exploit actually

374
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:15,490
it's not the key itself it's a whole

375
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,589
system and how they recommend you come

376
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:18,850
look at that we're going to have the the

377
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,829
device actually set up in the locksmith

378
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:23,829
area but this vendor we sent we notified

379
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,300
you assert about the vulnerability and

380
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,050
within six days of sending them a

381
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,240
certified mail message the CEO of the

382
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,209
company contacted us six days they have

383
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,149
been the most cooperative company ever

384
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,290
they have provided us all the hardware

385
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,750
we're about to show you this afternoon

386
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,370
they updated their software based on our

387
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,519
recommendations and amazing but they

388
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,529
could have very well said ooh you know

389
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:48,550
our systems are used in government

390
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,639
agencies we don't think you should talk

391
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,949
about this and here's why so are they

392
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:55,629
gonna be cooperative or two people

393
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,910
reporting stuff users right every one of

394
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,949
us has public users what will your

395
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,540
management do how seriously will they

396
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,670
take i found this problem will you fix

397
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,059
it we all work of vendors i am a third

398
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,500
party vendor for you i found this

399
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,600
problem salesforce does scans of their

400
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,490
partners for example I found these

401
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,079
issues you need to fix them or I'm going

402
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,819
to cut off your contract how does

403
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:17,470
management think about that what kind of

404
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,569
priority it's important to know that and

405
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:20,709
how you going to deal with that and you

406
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:22,120
may pay a reward Google does it with

407
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,459
browsers right let's go Firefox as well

408
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,439
the blame game yep clearly everybody

409
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:31,720
wants to do this and that's something

410
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,680
that is a problem

411
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,000
because the reality is when you're

412
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,950
reacting or overreacting and you've gone

413
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,830
completely emotional with the situation

414
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,750
blaming somebody is the absolute wrong

415
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,450
thing to do so if you don't talk about

416
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,850
this to your management first and say

417
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,130
look incident management says we

418
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,770
investigate we gather information we do

419
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,110
post-mortem and we say this is what

420
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,910
broke this is how it hurt us and this is

421
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,500
what we do to prepare for it if you

422
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,830
overreact before you do all that

423
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,910
disappointing games and finger stuff

424
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,440
you're going to fire the wrong people or

425
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,470
make your situation worse and really

426
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,899
it's everyone's fault get that to be

427
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,839
agreed to as part of this enhanced role

428
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,130
based management training or Incident

429
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,370
Response improvement where you

430
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,779
understaffed we're going to budgeted how

431
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:18,980
many people here think they're not

432
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,959
understaffed or under budget I should

433
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,700
see everybody's hand go up right no yeah

434
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,560
one thinks he's properly staffed that's

435
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,100
rare and of course something to consider

436
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,810
believe it or not if you really need to

437
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,640
fire somebody for political reasons find

438
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,220
somebody who already left consider that

439
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,350
as an option believe it or not because

440
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,020
they left there might be somebody you

441
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,450
could actually blame for this but

442
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,890
consider these factors as a part of

443
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,140
talking to management we seriously need

444
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,660
to talk about this thing so we can

445
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,080
prepare for it so training management so

446
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,279
what do we train in management what's

447
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,470
important for them to think about do we

448
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,150
have options we know what's going to

449
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,830
happen how to be active for the big one

450
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,830
hits first off don't interfere with the

451
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,360
experts one of the things I can tell you

452
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,369
from my experience of the Comptroller

453
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,800
was we had people that knew zero about

454
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,900
security going around to all the

455
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,280
division managers scaring the holy

456
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,199
bejesus out of them making security

457
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,650
decisions that's bad that is really bad

458
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,510
you really have to leave this kind of

459
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,189
stuff in the hands of the experts and

460
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:21,079
management needs to understand and

461
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,300
accept that if you don't trust us now

462
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,520
and we can't get that line of

463
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,809
communication going for this kind of

464
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:29,120
problem you can pretty much guess that

465
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,650
that first slide i had about you

466
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,090
updating your resume is something you

467
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,370
should seriously consider it is

468
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,929
definitely I definitely look at the

469
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,580
companies I work for much differently

470
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,210
because of this hiring consultants oh we

471
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,559
got to bring in Gardner we got to bring

472
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,610
in a consultant a we got to get an

473
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,980
evaluation this wait a minute I can tell

474
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,120
you what's wrong with this

475
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,130
environment I've already reported it or

476
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,050
i can tell you pretty quickly what's

477
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,000
wrong you're understaffed under budgeted

478
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,110
you didn't buy these five

479
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,660
recommendations this in the case of Sony

480
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,520
veracode says a ten-thousand-dollar skin

481
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,900
would have prevented this they would

482
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,730
have found a sequel hole fixed it and

483
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,770
this would have never happened all right

484
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,780
so we already know this information and

485
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,820
you got to get management to trust us to

486
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,360
some point that we can tell you a lot

487
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,280
cheaper and I can tell you the cost of

488
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,860
these consultants were as much or

489
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,840
exceeded the amount of money we needed

490
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,460
to have presented the problem at the

491
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,830
Comptroller to begin with that's not a

492
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,900
good thing that's a waste of money and

493
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,820
it's a waste of resources yes

494
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,440
information security is underfunded how

495
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,230
many people here don't agree with that

496
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,150
it's underfunded right we are insurance

497
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,830
the companies don't want to pay for it

498
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,840
until something big happens they send a

499
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,220
lot of people told me the consultants

500
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,990
we're not going to spend that kind of

501
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,550
improvement unless something really

502
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,600
occurs but how big they don't comprehend

503
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,520
a sony or comptroller related incident

504
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,500
and that's the part we really need to

505
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,510
get in their minds that think about it

506
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,790
even if it's a month or two or three or

507
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,370
a year we really really need them to

508
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,470
think about this I don't want to lose my

509
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,610
job and I really want to help you

510
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,280
succeed but we need to know and you

511
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,600
don't want to go down the scapegoat

512
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,980
scenario where you just start blaming

513
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:13,190
people and throwing them out the door if

514
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,300
you lose key individuals in your

515
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,240
environment what happens a you lose the

516
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,410
people that actually know the most about

517
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,809
your environment be the amount of time

518
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,070
it takes you to improve the environment

519
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,740
just slow down what used to probably

520
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,330
take you a month or two or three is

521
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,130
probably take you six seven or eight so

522
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,600
now you're vulnerable even longer and

523
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,000
worse because you're overreacting people

524
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,350
get scared what happens when people get

525
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,929
scared they leave ship that's the

526
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:41,450
reality of it infosec people can help

527
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,610
here many of us are motivated by the

528
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,309
fact that this is cool this is forensics

529
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,809
this is I really want to know what's

530
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:49,220
going on I really want to delve into

531
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,510
this look what I found so it's fun force

532
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,310
sort of it really is this is one of

533
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,929
those areas it's not paperwork and I got

534
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,429
a nod in the back this is not the

535
00:19:58,429 --> 00:19:59,870
paperwork this is not the policy this is

536
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,320
not the guy

537
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,090
rinse this is the cool that we

538
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,009
actually get to deal with how'd they get

539
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,049
in where do they get in what do they do

540
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,330
how long we were here that's the stuff i

541
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,500
know a couple people in this room are

542
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,409
really good at I'd hate to lose them in

543
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,220
the event of the big one others loyal to

544
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,929
the scapegoats will leave the company I

545
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,039
lasted a month of the Comptroller before

546
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,080
I got the hell out I became the acting I

547
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,840
so and I said few people are freaking

548
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,009
crazy and I left because a you weren't

549
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,200
making progress on a ship that we had

550
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,850
headed to the right direction you have

551
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,470
turned it around sent back to port and

552
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,620
Yuri staffed now I'm sorry but no wrong

553
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,330
approach you're not any better off

554
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,370
you're going to get beaten up people are

555
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,169
going to continue to talk and since then

556
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:46,789
i have seen leaks in the paper about

557
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:49,610
what the Comptroller has not done wrong

558
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,259
approach I think it was totally totally

559
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:55,070
the wrong approach firing or the threat

560
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,899
of termination once you do this how do

561
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:57,919
you think anybody work for the

562
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,659
Comptroller now after two people were

563
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,879
fired four people were fired how

564
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,230
confident you think that people are

565
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,240
there with their jobs or how many people

566
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,100
you think left our department all the

567
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,840
people that are hired since me or that

568
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,200
my boss hired before me are all gone

569
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,389
that's not a good thing because I worked

570
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,070
with a great staff three the best people

571
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,460
ever they're gone that's not good your

572
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,809
company does not prosper there i can

573
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:24,230
tell you HP we had the same problem and

574
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,879
again it's not anyone's one person's

575
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:28,039
fault management's the one that tells us

576
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,779
we can or can't do anything I mean you

577
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:31,580
may find total and utter incompetents

578
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,860
that's entirely possible and that person

579
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,679
deserves to be fired but you really need

580
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,210
to have all your facts you really need

581
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,559
to understand it you really need to say

582
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,950
hey this is what cause and effect this

583
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,460
is the final result yes that entity

584
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,860
person department people were at fault

585
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,809
don't say I need to fire somebody

586
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,700
because I need to show something changed

587
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,450
people are people are tuned down my neck

588
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,679
this is the overreaction this is the

589
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,830
emotions coming out and you will weaken

590
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,940
your environment if you do emotional

591
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,730
overreaction so take aways so here's

592
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,960
what I want you to take away with this I

593
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,940
want everybody to start thinking with

594
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,350
these couple slides this we posted on my

595
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,490
website and I'll

596
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,780
bite it to Michael as well for you

597
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,160
second we need to repair our management

598
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,510
we have an incident response plan it may

599
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,530
be the greatest in the face of the

600
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,960
planet but we do not have anything in

601
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,660
here about this we need to create role

602
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,790
based training for management we need to

603
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,020
figure out how to have a conversation

604
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,360
lunch and learn how do you invite your

605
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,970
your EXO's into some meeting to say

606
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,800
let's talk about this let's start

607
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,540
thinking about it your retailer maybe a

608
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,700
coupon if you're a cloud provider oh boy

609
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,260
what about contracts what happens if you

610
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,720
get if you get pwned you may now start

611
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,940
seeing requirements to tell you any

612
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,100
breach in any of your infrastructure in

613
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,690
the cloud you might need to report it

614
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,000
and suddenly that's going to cause them

615
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,410
to terminate contracts a lot of things

616
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,000
you got to think about but start talking

617
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,250
about this think about a full you know

618
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,380
fake faux Cybermen anybody ever

619
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,630
participate in cyber storm 3 other than

620
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,600
you two and me anybody know nobody's

621
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,370
done any cyber storm 3 stuff we'll talk

622
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,010
about that in a second Craig pre

623
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,710
decisions okay we're a retailer we're

624
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,450
gjx if something big hat like this

625
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,100
happens again I guarantee you they're

626
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,809
going to put another coupon out pre

627
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:20,240
decisions been determined I agree we do

628
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,770
not do any press releases for two weeks

629
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,110
I agree the management number one person

630
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,740
will come out and say we're

631
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,030
investigating this will let you know in

632
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,190
10 days whatever it is that pre decision

633
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,870
can come out that can help you to give

634
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,080
people time to get information

635
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,100
management needs information they want

636
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,250
it yesterday pre decisions have got to

637
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,190
take place try to come up with clever

638
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,520
responses get management to consider the

639
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,980
worst-case scenario not that something

640
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,170
failed and it's unavailable but that

641
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,850
this person is now target it's gonna be

642
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,890
written up in the paper oh my gosh the

643
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,610
big one the really big one plane I see

644
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,559
nights to security researchers many of

645
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:00,380
us have morals and do not do something

646
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,960
stupid like have the authorities go to

647
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,150
them unless you have absolute proof they

648
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,679
did this on purpose and there's some

649
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,840
serious evidence there it will just make

650
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,290
you look like a complete idiot warn them

651
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,000
of a loss of talent talk to him about

652
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,090
sony Sony tried and posted just this

653
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,559
made all the tweets of anybody didn't

654
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,540
see this I'd be amazed where they tried

655
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,040
to hire some application security

656
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,470
specialist those postings are open for

657
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,240
over three months this is Sony who

658
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
wouldn't go work at Sony before this

659
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,809
everybody would have gone at filling

660
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,880
applications Comptroller could not get

661
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,309
decent resumes they're just now six

662
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,320
months later filling the vacancies that

663
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,929
we had for seven eight months that's

664
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:42,020
that's that's tough people are scared or

665
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,330
shy away from this kind of companies

666
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,170
because a they know they're going to be

667
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,330
scapegoats be what kind of cluster bomb

668
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,100
am I getting myself into I don't want to

669
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,640
work there build trust one of the things

670
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,350
we don't have with management is trust

671
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,679
we need to get in there and realize that

672
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,470
we are there for their cya that's our

673
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,980
purpose in life and so try to get that

674
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,090
get them to not play the blame game

675
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,900
that's not good cost savings by trusting

676
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,400
don't go hire a bunch of consultants

677
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,590
spend that money on actual improvements

678
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,840
please trust us please listen to us this

679
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,790
is what we'll need we have the priority

680
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,410
it comes up every year everybody does

681
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,940
budget everybody has a priority

682
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,910
everybody gets some sort of funding or

683
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,929
not and so just execute on the plan and

684
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:28,580
then if it doesn't work you can fire us

685
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,690
later but be proactive that's the big

686
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,240
one be proactive if you haven't

687
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,820
participated in cyber storm whatever one

688
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,290
two or three four is going to be next

689
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,679
spring next next fall I would recommend

690
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:45,350
it that was a fantastic experience for

691
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,890
me so my boss set up the local criteria

692
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,960
homeland security setup the global

693
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,790
criteria countries all over the world

694
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,740
participated agencies all over the

695
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,150
United States and within the state of

696
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,160
Texas participated not as many as I'd

697
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,280
like to see but the experience was

698
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,929
fascinating because I'm telling you the

699
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,429
reaction to some of these agencies and

700
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,920
companies blew my mind what do you mean

701
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,150
you haven't called the feds yet to find

702
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,790
out what's going on with this it was it

703
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,470
was an amazing experience so bring it

704
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,720
emotionally into your company what's the

705
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,240
unique thing you do that if it got pwned

706
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,790
I'm a cloud provider I got data data

707
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,650
exchange going on in Amazon as well as

708
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,900
issuer if somebody totally took over one

709
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,790
of these units how our clients react

710
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,800
what would happen to our our agreements

711
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,390
what would they do for future business

712
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,640
would they terminate us with a blacklist

713
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,100
what think of the worst possible

714
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,440
scenario understand your assets and say

715
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,330
let's

716
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,220
a half a day when is management and

717
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,930
brainstorming sessions and say let's go

718
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,910
through this what do you think you would

719
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,170
do what would your first response well

720
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,700
we've obviously have this would go

721
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,380
through it capture that get them

722
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,330
thinking and that's what cyber storm 3

723
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,460
was all about go through this try to see

724
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,010
if it would work dry run probably the

725
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,440
worst dr you know experience here we're

726
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,640
going to have because at least ER

727
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,170
they've gone through for years and years

728
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,730
and years this is kind of knew and

729
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,980
nobody does it but clearly it is a great

730
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,390
opportunity for you to really get

731
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,850
management involved and like you know

732
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,650
any dr plan repeated every couple years

733
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,800
cyber storms threes every two years

734
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,140
their cyber storms every cheers and if

735
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,720
you prepare for that big-time breach

736
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,790
really really bad sony comptroller kind

737
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,800
of breach you can't help to avoid or

738
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,500
mitigate the issues that will occur thus

739
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,210
avoiding the scapegoat and bus

740
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,640
methodology because scapegoat plus throw

741
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,380
me under the bus does equal termination

742
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,120
how many people in this room do not want

743
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,890
to be terminated I know I'm one of them

744
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,200
everybody raises their hand now so that

745
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,970
is the takeaway think about this as a

746
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,220
role based management and if you have

747
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,050
any questions great but if we are going

748
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,370
to share any information the camera does

749
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,820
have to go off
