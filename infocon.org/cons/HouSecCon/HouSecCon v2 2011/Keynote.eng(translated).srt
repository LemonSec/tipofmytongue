00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:09,620
mr. MJ Keith senior consultant at denim

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,269
group 10 years of experience in the

3
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:12,879
network and information security field

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,270
if you don't it who came last year okay

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,540

00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,100
adopted by Hugh second as our resident

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,500
researcher he popped a zero-day four

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
last year for Android made like

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,829
international press like we were number

12
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,350
one on slashdot that night it was just

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,879
crazy so I owe him a lot because we got

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,010
people wanting to present here because

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,559
we got so much press and it became a big

16
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,719
thing on our first year so thank you

17
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,780
very much he serves as a team lead on

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,550
all infrastructure security testing and

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,350
security policy analysis he works with

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,969
clients to implement security lifecycle

21
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:58,579
activities y'all know MJ you know I

22
00:00:58,579 --> 00:00:59,839
don't want to go through all that stuff

23
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:02,030
he's but he has been quoted in SC

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,390
magazine and computer world and he's

25
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,509
spoken at regional security conferences

26
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:14,270
such as Hugh sec con and besides in

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,240
Austin as well so he's going to be doing

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,770
keynote and then later on he's going to

29
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,240
be doing a technical presentation on

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,369
this so without further ado mr. him

31
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,610
jakey

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,430
alright first I want to thank Michael

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,690
and everybody that helped put the con

34
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,930
together and inviting me to do the

35
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,520
keynote usually technical guys don't get

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,610
to do ki net so it's kind of cool and

37
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,100
also everybody for showing up all the

38
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,970
sponsors I think these type of smaller

39
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,710
conferences are kind of getting more

40
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,100
important because everybody's security

41
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,050
budgets kind of getting tighter not

42
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,610
everything make it to DEFCON a black hat

43
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,950
every year so thanks everybody what I'm

44
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,270
going to be talking about is just kind

45
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,490
of clouds and sass stuff because it's

46
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,440
the new thing it's what everybody wants

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,899
to talk about everybody's trying to

48
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,800
develop products for this is just like

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,840
kind of my opinion on the thing I've

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,260
seen tons of them tons of cloud talks

51
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,490
and as you know I don't necessarily

52
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,650
always agree with what people are saying

53
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,480
in those talks so I'm just want to put

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,660
my own spin on it first thing this is

55
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,330
just a pet peeve of mine if you're not a

56
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,160
south park fan just replace the word

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,900
marklar with Smurfs and you should get

58
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,690
it people over use the word cloud it's

59
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,100
every every time you look around there's

60
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,520
a new cloud service now I think a lot of

61
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,209
us would kind of disagree whoops I kind

62
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,930
of covered that up I think a lot of us

63
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,220
agree that a lot of stuff they're trying

64
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,170
to call cloud now isn't even remotely

65
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,140
cloud I think cloud gaming was probably

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,390
probably the most ridiculous 1 i've

67
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,410
heard but they just keep coming oops

68
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,030
wrong direction okay so um whenever

69
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,230
you're going to talk about cloth stuff

70
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,520
you kinda have to be specific because

71
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,989
there's so many different different

72
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,410
things we label that that you know if I

73
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,000
start talking about cloud so if you

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,040
wouldn't know where I was going so these

75
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,780
are the main types of clouds stuff we're

76
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,330
going to be discussing and also

77
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,400
resellers are becoming really big and

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,550
that's actually opens up like a whole

79
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,120
new layer of security problems that

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,470
stuff will be kind of going through

81
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,880
deeper in the technical talk

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,800
so when you use those different types of

83
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,110
services what kind of information are

84
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,420
you exposing and I don't necessarily

85
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,060
mean what what's actually getting out

86
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,130
there what's being abused but what are

87
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,810
you putting in a position that could

88
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,050
potentially be taken advantage of for

89
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,180
some of the services like Google Maps

90
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,190
like if you want to put a Google map on

91
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,470
your side you're not really handing off

92
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,080
a ton of specific data you're just going

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,400
to be given out things like launched to

94
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,940
latitude possibly whatever informations

95
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,310
on your site that Google can tie into

96
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,570
that but you know google has probably

97
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,760
the most knowledge out of out of all

98
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,430
companies they know everything we search

99
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,520
for they know what restaurants get

100
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,220
looked up the most all this stuff and

101
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,050
when they can tie that back in with the

102
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,420
longitude latitude data that gives them

103
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,270
more information about it and they all

104
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,460
kind of vary as far as like the type of

105
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,990
cloud you using and the exposure that

106
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,410
comes along with it things like you know

107
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,090
file storage well you're giving up the

108
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,800
files you're putting them in a place

109
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,300
where you don't you don't necessarily

110
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,870
have direct control things more like you

111
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,920
know Salesforce or software as a service

112
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,400
in the crm specific sales force you're

113
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,510
going to be giving up your client

114
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,770
information like who your customers are

115
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,720
communications sometimes content and

116
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,150
then if you're if you're using like ec2

117
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,710
that's that's going to be pretty much

118
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,120
everything I've seen a lot of security

119
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,180
at our security talks about the cloud

120
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,430
I'm still not sure what's so specific

121
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,890
about the cloud like why why are you

122
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,690
just now vulnerable because you're in

123
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,270
the cloud you know you can set up a

124
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,740
host-based ids you can set up a

125
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,720
host-based firewall you there are

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,080
protections there and I think the reason

127
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,650
is because it's the new thing you know

128
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,980
voice over IP I remember early 2000 I

129
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,110
used to just be able to scan along port

130
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,360
23 and you know

131
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,550
just get into hundreds of polycom

132
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,370
systems they would actually pop up had a

133
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,680
really cool little banner it would say

134
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,509
this is my IP and this is what I know

135
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:04,039
about it myself and then it would say

136
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,419
you know you're now logged in as

137
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,050
administrator what do you want to do and

138
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,189
you know that's that's something that's

139
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,860
been cleaned up we now understand how

140
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,250
voice over IP can be abused smart

141
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,409
leaders are another big one skate is

142
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,840
nothing new but it's kind of made a huge

143
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,020
comeback lately so every new technology

144
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,930
gets beat up you know I don't know how

145
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,810
you hacked phone lines with cereal boxes

146
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,669
maybe there was somebody older that can

147
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,419
explain that and yeah luckily pinga de

148
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,460
pina death no longer happens I think

149
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,930
it's just it's more appropriate to say

150
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,590
immature rather than insecure but if

151
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,719
nobody really tries to move forward with

152
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,629
it then it stays in that in that state

153
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,659
it doesn't gain any and yes I look a lot

154
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,819
like the dude that was my halloween

155
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,800
costume last year but I don't really

156
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,719
think it's that bad you know I mean if

157
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:08,479
you tried using cloud services sure as

158
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,550
vulnerabilities but more likely there's

159
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,589
vulnerabilities if you're hosted in the

160
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,289
local data center and it's the same kind

161
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,529
of vulnerabilities but there are a

162
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:19,699
couple things you want to just kind of

163
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,770
know before you decide one way or the

164
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,659
other if the clouds right for your

165
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:27,080
business if you want to support it if

166
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,370
you want to try to knock it down one of

167
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,689
the first things that kind of comes to

168
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,710
mind is the Patriot Act and just other

169
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,080
US laws and other countries laws

170
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,099
basically the government wants your data

171
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:45,919
they're going to get it there's there's

172
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,270
you know different legal steps depending

173
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,289
on what type of data thereafter for

174
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:54,860
example if if an email is hosted on

175
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,889
gmail and it's 180 days old they don't

176
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,839
even need a warrant they can just go in

177
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,659
and take it now Google Google tries a

178
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:03,710
lot harder than

179
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,370
places to protect their customers and at

180
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,890
minimum kind of notify them if something

181
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,810
or if the government's requesting their

182
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,610
data but this has been this has been

183
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,260
happening quite a bit lately especially

184
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,620
around the jacob appelbaum wikileaks

185
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:28,090
stuff Twitter tried to fight it lost I

186
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,590
think Google and his local ISP are still

187
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,940
kind of battling over it and if

188
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,409
something is hosted in the cloud and the

189
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,830
government decides to seize it are you

190
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,840
going to be notified well not if it's a

191
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,330
National Security Letter this is

192
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,920
actually pretty old it's not not

193
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,970
something they just came out with the

194
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,730
Patriot Act but it's being used more and

195
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,960
more and the the kick with that is that

196
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,570
the National Security Letter also comes

197
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,680
with like an onboard gag order that this

198
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,240
prevents you from even telling anyone

199
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,630
that you have received this letter Joe

200
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,020
versus ash croc was the I guess kind of

201
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,960
biggest case involving this it's

202
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,060
actually listed as doe vs Ashcroft for

203
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,890
that reason because they couldn't even

204
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,370
use their name in the lawsuit and

205
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,130
basically what happened there is

206
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,000
initially the judicial system sided with

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,620
with doe the ISP I got appealed to a

208
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,980
higher court got kicked back down and by

209
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,050
the time they looked at it again they

210
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,490
said there's no point and continuing

211
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,520
here because the laws have already

212
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,080
changed the Patriot Act has gotten

213
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,720
stronger so they just kind of threw it

214
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,010
out there hasn't really been any other

215
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,090
challenges to these national security

216
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,520
letters since then or at least not that

217
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,790
we know about if your data stored

218
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,900
outside of the US and it's a US company

219
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,010
for example Microsoft Amazon they're

220
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,590
still going to hand your data over this

221
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,160
is even if you're not a US citizen your

222
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,530
data is not stored on US soil they're

223
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,059
still going to hand it over

224
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:19,099
Microsoft I think got the most slack for

225
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,649
this because they kind of were

226
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:24,259
questioned publicly on it and responded

227
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:29,239
but honestly amazon Rackspace any other

228
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,189
cloud service thus hosted our that's

229
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:33,249
kind of centered in the united states

230
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:37,369
they're all subject to this now if you

231
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:42,349
look at other countries and not us

232
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:44,089
companies kind of depends on the

233
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,659
country's laws and that that company

234
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,609
that you're dealing with they may want

235
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,229
to be all friendly with the united

236
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:54,649
states they may not and if you if you've

237
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:55,969
ever looked through some of the release

238
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,919
WikiLeaks cables you've probably seen

239
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,189
that they make a lot of strange deals to

240
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:04,579
get you know get information get gold

241
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:09,559
actually in one of the cases if it's

242
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,569
somewhere like Holland Holland really

243
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:15,999
does not like our privacy rules they

244
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:19,429
they do not allow certain certain

245
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,939
sectors of their of their infrastructure

246
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:26,269
and business to to even use us cloud

247
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,239
services and it's because they don't

248
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:32,299
trust it they they think that we make it

249
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,949
way too easy for the government's pull

250
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:37,279
data about you a couple other countries

251
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,679
Canada has also kind of pushed this

252
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,149
Canada generally backs down it's hard

253
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:45,889
being somebody's neighbor and you know

254
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:49,669
arguing with them all the time but this

255
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:51,409
has actually turned out to be somewhat

256
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,299
of a roadblock for cloud providers

257
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:56,689
because they can't they can't push the

258
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:59,029
services around the world and if you're

259
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:00,829
gonna if you're going to push a service

260
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,659
like the cloud I mean that's kind of

261
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,899
what it's meant for and if you're not

262
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,149
using a cloud service and this is kind

263
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,629
of a theme of the talk is there still

264
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,549
going to get it I mean you may know

265
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:14,959
about it if they have to come in your

266
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,219
house and take it yeah they're going to

267
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,319
have to have a warrant but at the same

268
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,609
time you're not going to stop them from

269
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:22,369
getting it if you know you use good

270
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:24,409
encryption things like that and they're

271
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,119
even working on ways to make sure that

272
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:29,209
you will turn over the encryption keys

273
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:30,110
or

274
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,220
you know sit in jail so yes there are

275
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,589
some threats from this but honestly if

276
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,269
they want your data if its hiding under

277
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:43,690
your bed they're going to get compliancy

278
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,190
I'm speaking specifically about socks

279
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,350
and HIPAA in this part just because they

280
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,630
tend to be more similar than than PCI

281
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,820
they're both you know they're both

282
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,950
considered compliancy standards that

283
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,800
most of us are familiar with I've worked

284
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,140
in hospitals worked for PCI ASV socks

285
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,850
that haven't had as much direct contact

286
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,940
with but it's still something we we have

287
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,019
to deal with as far as a compliancy

288
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,910
those far as data security that's not

289
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,920
really what they're intended to do we

290
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,390
kind of talked about them a lot like

291
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,839
they are but but really they're there's

292
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,820
not much there as far as data security

293
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,670
and what is there's very nonspecific I

294
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,680
think in the HIPAA standard there's

295
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,990
actually a couple of sections that end

296
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,899
with to the best of your ability what is

297
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,790
that you know can you can you prove that

298
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,019
I mean maybe you know rot13 is the best

299
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:44,720
I can do that's probably the best

300
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,220
encryption standard i could write by

301
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,010
myself if i couldn't rely on libraries

302
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,399
or something that would be about it sock

303
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,079
specifically came about because they

304
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,060
Enron there were a couple other fraud

305
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,100
cases that that helped it out but that

306
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,250
was the main push and that's what it's

307
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,500
meant to protect it's meant to be

308
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,779
forensic so they can go back and look at

309
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,240
financial records and say did you commit

310
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,579
fraud cobit is often like referred to as

311
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:16,550
the data security standard for socks but

312
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,029
it's not really official I think they

313
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,829
just kind of leached onto that because

314
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:23,990
it was the the most established standard

315
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,930
at the time and cove it does kind of

316
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,190
clear up some of the stuff but as I'll

317
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,250
get to a lot of a lot of these different

318
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,029
compliances are now leaning on pci just

319
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,910
because it's so much clearer as far as

320
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,050
HIPAA again it's focused on patient

321
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,250
and the the appropriate transfer of that

322
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,470
data there's not a whole lot there for

323
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,100
data security it's can i legally turn

324
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,500
this over to you do you have a right to

325
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,950
request this and if so which of these

326
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,160
standards does that fall under there are

327
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,649
a couple things about like not using

328
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,560
shared counts things like that but it

329
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,209
doesn't really go very in-depth at all

330
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,209
when it comes to to actual like what I

331
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:16,649
consider at least network security high

332
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,110
tech was kind of a addition to HIPAA and

333
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,240
hitech added a couple more computer

334
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,180
security things but the main focus of it

335
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,180
was breach notification so that if you

336
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,910
know your hospital or insurance provider

337
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,339
gets hacked they send you a little card

338
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,500
with a kitten and spilt milk and they're

339
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,060
like sorry lost your data which I mean

340
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,470
it's better to be notified and not

341
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,950
notified but but still you're not really

342
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,360
not really doing to get at that point

343
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,720
pci it differs in a lot of ways from

344
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,480
from socks and HIPAA one it's not

345
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,450
managed by the government there are pros

346
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,680
and cons with this one anything that the

347
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,870
government does is slow everything

348
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,579
requires legislation you know and well i

349
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,440
mean i know they reaffirm the whole in

350
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,560
god we trust' thing yesterday all other

351
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,760
problems are apparently solved and yeah

352
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,260
I don't even think anybody was disputing

353
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,350
that but as far as socks and hip ago the

354
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,839
good part about that being managed by

355
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,670
the government is that they have more

356
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,899
teeth they they they can find you pretty

357
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,579
heavily they've got a little more

358
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,100
control on the flip side of that with

359
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,180
with hip or I'm sorry with PCI it's much

360
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,130
faster it can adapt to technology

361
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,339
quicker you've got a council that that

362
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,070
kind of votes on these things and you

363
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,600
know implements changes

364
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,209
but the downside is it's run by the

365
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,420
credit card companies so if they're

366
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,000
going to find or just refuse to work

367
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,849
with certain companies that refuse to

368
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:10,720
get compliant that's kind of conflict of

369
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,939
interest to a degree and from what I've

370
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,900
seen so far I think that they manage

371
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,410
that well but but it's just it's one of

372
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,579
those things you kind of have to think

373
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:26,770
about as far as the cloud goes in

374
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,130
relation to pci and i wanted to go in

375
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,390
depth with this one because like i said

376
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,070
the other ones really don't say a whole

377
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,490
lot about it there are a lot of

378
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:44,020
different parts of PCI DSS that at least

379
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,179
in my opinion would specifically like

380
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,799
limit the use of certain cloud

381
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:51,280
environments you've gotta build the

382
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,890
firewall router configuration restricts

383
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,799
connections between untrusted networks

384
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,940
good luck with that implemented DMZ no

385
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,200
need to go any further on that one

386
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,580
that's that's that's going to be tough

387
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,130
use intrusion detection the way this is

388
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,780
written here I mean it seems like you

389
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,010
know this has to be a network IDs I

390
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,850
don't really see why a local our heads

391
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,309
would would be a problem here and a lot

392
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,049
of the cloud services are now offering

393
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,590
that so it's one of the things you can

394
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,299
get into the kind of details of it with

395
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:31,480
an auditor and if any of y'all went

396
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,179
through an audit before that's kind of

397
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,370
what you're at the discretion of none of

398
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,740
these things are you know cut and dry

399
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,190
and it's always up to their discretion

400
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,210
but one of the good things are another

401
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,429
good thing about pci is that the

402
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:46,929
industry can kind of change things

403
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,350
faster this was actually a nightmare for

404
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,909
me personally but the the first like ASV

405
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:58,299
standard required that if you're using a

406
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:00,100
secured site and you're using a

407
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,669
certificate that the exact address of

408
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:07,210
that site be listed in the circuit I

409
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,070
mean it be verbatim what

410
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,389
in there well that drove me insane

411
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:15,279
because every scan that we did came back

412
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,519
is you're violating this well by the

413
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,740
time you know a couple years later when

414
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,889
like the PCI DSS two came out this was

415
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,779
no longer an issue and what had actually

416
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,210
happened there was all the big cert

417
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,429
providers had said hey we're going to

418
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:33,519
start offering PCI compliant wild card

419
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,039
certs and I mean I remember the first

420
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,809
time I saw it and I'm like that that's

421
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,809
but you can't and now they've got that

422
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:43,049
change so that that is actually ok now

423
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,340
and and that's that can be good or bad

424
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,139
the industry can push things in really

425
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:51,429
bad directions or good directions and if

426
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:52,809
they push it a bad direction come up

427
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:54,220
with an exploit to prove that that's a

428
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,659
bad direction as far as a different

429
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:01,690
types of solutions some companies have

430
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,350
tried to do this in the cloud I couldn't

431
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,240
find a whole lot of details on the

432
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,769
difference you know they're really

433
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,000
getting down on the nitty-gritty of how

434
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,940
it works so I really don't have too much

435
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,779
of an opinion on that at this point but

436
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:17,769
I can't tell you most the

437
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:21,700
infrastructures that are most the cloud

438
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,070
infrastructure isn't really capable of

439
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,169
pulling off some of these things or at

440
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:28,929
least as they're currently written and

441
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:32,350
then if you talk about the cloud

442
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,350
computing Association their solution is

443
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,629
to do your content hosting in the cloud

444
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:40,659
and all your back in processing you know

445
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:43,559
locally or in your own data center I

446
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,940
don't know why anybody would do this I

447
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,830
mean usually if you're if you're worried

448
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,330
about scaling something it's not the

449
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,159
flat content it's going to be the

450
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,200
dynamic stuff it's going to be the

451
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,679
database driven stuff and you know if

452
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:58,720
you're using some sort of API to talk

453
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,419
back to it I mean some of that has to be

454
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,970
hosted in the cloud you know it's got to

455
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,039
be on that web server they're talking to

456
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,490
so I mean yeah I guess that would

457
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,519
technically work you know it's it would

458
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,309
still have credit cards in memory you

459
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,929
know probably stored on the disk

460
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:20,020
somewhere log files something like that

461
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,910
but this is what they're suggesting I

462
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,950
don't really think it worked but you

463
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,290
know all right it's not a good solution

464
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,690
some of the technical side of things and

465
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,300
these are things that you know

466
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,950
specifically you have to think of with

467
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,890
cloud stuff at Def Con 17 Alex Stamos

468
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,230
did a pretty good talk about abusing the

469
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,110
Amazon public am I system and what this

470
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,630
is is a amazon has a couple different

471
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,690
image types you can pick from and you

472
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,550
can also build your own put it up there

473
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,930
and decide if you want to share that

474
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,430
with others well what he did was figured

475
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,070
out that one their rankings are

476
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,710
basically done on just a pre randomly

477
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,070
assigned ID number so he could resubmit

478
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,290
the same image over and over again until

479
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,270
he got a low enough number to show up in

480
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,880
the first page what he was also able to

481
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,190
do was put a little callback script in

482
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,190
there that would notify him every time

483
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,710
someone loaded his image well if you're

484
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,240
able to run that code you could run some

485
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,540
other code in fact this this was

486
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,340
unintentional but there was a situation

487
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,700
where somebody had put an image in

488
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,690
Amazon public images and they had put a

489
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,050
root ssh certificate in there well if

490
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,340
you're not using the tools to like

491
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,820
lockdown sshh or you know in any other

492
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,400
service that you can use like that you

493
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,250
can just log in as root any of them so

494
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,110
there's definitely some concerns there

495
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,910
but again I don't really think that's a

496
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,490
cloud problem mysql got hacked their

497
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,800
software got trojan and then it's not

498
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,540
the first time that's happened you don't

499
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,920
really need to be in the cloud for that

500
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,650
to happen there are some other things

501
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,680
softwares consistent if you find a bug

502
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,280
in one of the the 26 amazon sponsored or

503
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,630
created am eyes which which by the way

504
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,420
out of that 26 at least a good five of

505
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,400
them are like to teach you how to use

506
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,800
their cloud so they're not something

507
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,090
you'd really run in production they're

508
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,560
like you load them up and kind of play

509
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,360
with it for a little while before you

510
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,040
put a real real image on there but if

511
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,440
you found a bug in one of their one of

512
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,360
their default images you could probably

513
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,760
replay that attack across you know

514
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,820
amazon's network and take out quite a

515
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,450
few people another thing is apps they

516
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,980
usually have like either either their

517
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,020
pre packaged in the am i or there's like

518
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,870
an easy install and this especially when

519
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,780
you're talking about cloud web hosting

520
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,520
those usually have just like a

521
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,500
push-button install WordPress install

522
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,990
copper mine what have you so just

523
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,820
because you know people are offering

524
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,900
these things doesn't mean you have to

525
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,310
use them you can still do your you know

526
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,770
just do a base debian install and put

527
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,660
wordpress on it put a database on it and

528
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,240
you can kind of get hit by malicious

529
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,770
software either way or just poorly

530
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,490
written software so basically there's

531
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,350
nothing new it's this is all the same

532
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,900
stuff it's just replayed again in a new

533
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,270
technology when i did the the android

534
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,290
attack that Michael was talking about

535
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,700
that you know that was not a specific

536
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,850
phone memory corruption it was just

537
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,380
memory corruption it was a use after

538
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,890
free that you know we all seen before on

539
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,180
computers it was just neat because it

540
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,790
was on a phone now if you could write

541
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,560
one for a calculator that would be cool

542
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,840
too but as far as compliancy you have

543
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,750
some issues but the compliancy isn't

544
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,270
really security I mean a lot of us don't

545
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,550
do what we do because we're just dying

546
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,920
to be compliant now it's you know you

547
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
want to be able to protect the data

548
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,680
compliancy shouldn't limit that ever and

549
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,510
there's some things you can do you know

550
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,950
if you follow the compliancy standards

551
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,060
like patching and things like that

552
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,860
that's going to help but that by no

553
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,200
means makes you secure so you know I

554
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,970
just hacked you know can you see this

555
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,400
we're were compliant privacy issues

556
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,560
that's like I said with the the whole

557
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,890
Patriot Act slide this is gonna happen

558
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,680
you know it's it's out there how many

559
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,050
users is Facebook up to now I mean

560
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,460
people love

561
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,370
data out there and really aren't happy

562
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,080
when people find an interesting use for

563
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,110
it but it doesn't stop anything it still

564
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,320
keeps growing Twitter keeps getting

565
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,000
bigger all these things for square which

566
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,260
why I need everybody to know where I am

567
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,720
all the time so you know if you're in a

568
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,820
cloud and you know you get hacked I mean

569
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,080
did you get hacked because you were in

570
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,779
the cloud I mean possibly I guess it

571
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:16,260
could have been you know by proxy but

572
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,000
there's you know there's no specific

573
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,610
cloud attacks there's no like cloud

574
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,120
memory attacks or or you know clouds

575
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,059
csrf or anything like that there there's

576
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,860
the same bugs it's just reapply in a

577
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,720
different environment if we learn how to

578
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,490
fix those in the first place that

579
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,820
wouldn't be a problem over here either

580
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,789
so the real problem is is is the impact

581
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:43,570
of the whole thing I mean you know

582
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,580
buffer overflow is a problem here it's a

583
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,470
problem here but this one when this one

584
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,250
hits it's going to be huge but as or at

585
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,559
least most of us here you know as a you

586
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,480
know small or even a larger business

587
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,240
we're not driving the exxon valdez were

588
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,149
we're driving the car and slamming

589
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:07,149
whiskey as far as you know what what our

590
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:08,950
risk is it's really not that different

591
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,750
than if you were hosting it in a data

592
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,850
center you know or you know even in

593
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,750
house if you're you know if you're

594
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,070
hosting something to data center and you

595
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,899
get hacked and somebody gets all your

596
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,149
data how is that that much different

597
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:24,309
than if you're hosting everything in ec

598
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,760
to somebody hacks it gets all your data

599
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,440
there is one difference that I see I'm

600
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,630
going to go into but but for the most

601
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,860
part I mean you're kind of dealing with

602
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,330
the same stuff the same types of attacks

603
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,419
the same same poorly written code things

604
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:41,919
like that so just like just like any

605
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,570
time you want to add a new system to

606
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,429
your network dealing if the marketing

607
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:46,809
guy comes services a we need to add a

608
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:49,539
new blog pop open a hold of firewall and

609
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:52,840
you know give me a server that's

610
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,490
something you can't just do that you

611
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,929
have to like figure out how this is

612
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:57,639
going to impact your whole network

613
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,619
you have to make sure that system is

614
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:02,950
secured and I kind of view the cloud the

615
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,899
same way if you're you're basically

616
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:10,059
adding software and kind of a kind of

617
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:12,700
like the where it differs is it's kind

618
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,529
of like the the one ring to control them

619
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,539
all kind of thing if you find a hole in

620
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:21,519
amazon services like amazon's hypervisor

621
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,799
you know provisioning services I mean

622
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:26,200
well you basically got everything you've

623
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,969
got you've got more data than you would

624
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:32,469
know what to deal with so that's really

625
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:34,959
the only difference I see is you know

626
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,609
you're adding you're adding these layers

627
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:39,339
that make it oh you're kidding me that

628
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:42,789
didn't load what okay given what's that

629
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,559
this is too funny to mince

630
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,910
name

631
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,290
okay I'll just load it up something else

632
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,649
can you say

633
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,250
there we go sorry for the way technical

634
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:19,610
difficulties probably the cloth yes you

635
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,720
are correct sir oh oh well okay we'll

636
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,540
just skip that but essentially I don't

637
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,920
know if you all know the the comic strip

638
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,470
meme from inception where he's doing the

639
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,930
reverse inception but basically is like

640
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,430
you know you should you should try using

641
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,320
my cloud service the guy says back you

642
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,680
know well maybe you should try a

643
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,870
sanitizing input just looks back at him

644
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,210
lame okay so whenever you add multiple

645
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,740
layers are out of layer especially on

646
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,170
top of everything else you you've kind

647
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,450
of got a problem you've you've added in

648
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,060
another another section another layer

649
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,760
that can have security vulnerabilities

650
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,930
and like I said nothing special just

651
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,710
same old stuff but you don't control

652
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,990
that you can't force that to be patched

653
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,200
a lot of times you you know you can't

654
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,220
really audit it so unless you're like

655
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,240
you know the government or a humongous

656
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,140
company they might let you do it so you

657
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,730
have to think about what happens now

658
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,160
you've you've maybe got a hole or two in

659
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,540
your web application that you're aware

660
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,250
about are aware of haven't patched it so

661
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,600
maybe your provider has the same thing

662
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,580
your cloud provider and if you're

663
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,080
dealing with a reseller at that point

664
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,670
now you've got possibly web possibly

665
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,100
vulnerable web application talking to a

666
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,430
possibly vulnerable API and then above

667
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,320
you know and this is above what you're

668
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,510
currently working with with all your

669
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,100
in-house stuff you know your web

670
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:03,950
applications your data storage all web

671
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,580
applications have flaws I don't think

672
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,710
I've ever done any type of assessment or

673
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,720
pen test on a web application where I

674
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,600
didn't find at least something you know

675
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,580
it's not always something like his epic

676
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,460
is a SQL injection or

677
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,649
injection but there's always something

678
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:24,529
there something that discloses something

679
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:29,890
about the back and things like that but

680
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,270
you know it's it's very likely that

681
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,529
you're going to have it actually i'll

682
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:35,570
show you all later it is incredibly

683
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:38,539
likely that your cloud provider has the

684
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:40,789
same problems you do and if they're

685
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:42,289
working through a reseller the resellers

686
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:44,960
code is usually a little bug here so now

687
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,760
you like kind of given the keys of the

688
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,020
kingdom to something you don't control

689
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,390
as far as infrastructure you know this

690
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,279
is pretty simple you're just you're

691
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,559
slapping another web application for

692
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,690
management on top of it but the

693
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,429
difference in this one and some of the

694
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:03,649
other ones is this can control

695
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:05,659
everything it can take take out

696
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:08,510
everything you have could alter it in

697
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,840
different ways if you if you're using a

698
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,090
reseller through this which this is this

699
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,669
is getting incredibly common I bumped

700
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,049
into this quite a few times while

701
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:22,460
testing services and not all of them say

702
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,549
hey were worried selling this when I

703
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,230
when I went and look back later after

704
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,779
I'd had an issue with that I did realize

705
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,399
they owe the only clue was that they had

706
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,169
cut and paste the frequently asked

707
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,779
questions off of the site they were

708
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:41,690
reselling from so if you're using more

709
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,770
like SAS or framework as a service

710
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,059
you're you're not really putting another

711
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:48,830
layer on top you're just kind of pushing

712
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,649
your stuff out of your protected layer

713
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:54,260
and under someone else's who you're

714
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,630
going to trust you then hopefully at

715
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,690
least protected as well as you were but

716
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,279
the problem with a lot of these in

717
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,049
particular like you know Salesforce

718
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,760
things like I don't know if you want to

719
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,370
call Facebook cloud but they have pretty

720
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,919
similar setup is that they allow a lot

721
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,130
of customization they allow applications

722
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,399
to be built how do you let somebody edit

723
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,220
code in your web application and keep it

724
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,480
secure I know that they've come up with

725
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,039
some really neat tricks for doing that

726
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,980
but there's when there's a will there's

727
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,020
a way somebody can always figure out a

728
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,380
way

729
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,060
it wasn't even that long ago like how

730
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,390
long has facebook that had their FB ml

731
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,870
and you know the facebook app service

732
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,630
has been quite a while well as early as

733
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,020
a think like five months ago 24 months

734
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,690
ago they had found basically with with

735
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,620
certain web applications using the FB ml

736
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,850
which is actually submitted as a

737
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,820
parameter to it yet or post request will

738
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,510
load the whole thing and FB ml isn't

739
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,520
really that different than HTML at all

740
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,120
and you can load malicious data that way

741
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,300
our load malicious sites cross-site

742
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,219
request forgery attacks cross-site

743
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,190
scripting and that's one of the reasons

744
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,440
like things like Twitter will never be

745
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,540
as insecure as Facebook because Twitter

746
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,210
doesn't do a whole lot facebook facebook

747
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,100
has so many different options you can

748
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,370
work with and we know with all that with

749
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,889
all that stuff you end up creating more

750
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:34,020
holes so basically what makes the the

751
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,810
the cloud of security wrist and it's

752
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,030
it's really the same stuff it's the same

753
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,770
type of attacks that we're already fully

754
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,070
aware of SQL injection attacks memory

755
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,350
corruption attacks if we figured out how

756
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,449
to solve those then they wouldn't be a

757
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:51,149
problem in the cloud either we don't

758
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:53,639
really seem to learn from our mistakes I

759
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,889
mean how long has actually we were

760
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:58,110
looking this up last night csrf has been

761
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:04,910
around since 1988 I I think i was on i

762
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,810
think it was on a trash 80 at that time

763
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:15,030
so i mean that is kind of a while and i

764
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,140
think one of the big problems with that

765
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,410
is is we keep trying to set up the cloud

766
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,940
like it was our own infrastructure we

767
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,090
keep trying to you know i want a dmz EO

768
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,030
and all this stuff segregated well

769
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,710
that's not really how it works at least

770
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,590
not right now so we either need to

771
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,540
figure out a way to make it work that

772
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,410
way or possibly even better figure out a

773
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,940
way to

774
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,339
I mean that's what that's what we're

775
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,109
supposed to do as you know security

776
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:48,630
people we're supposed to take what we're

777
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,609
given figure out how to do something

778
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,020
else with it something more creative

779
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,880
that works out better than the original

780
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,640
idea as I said we keep repeating the

781
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,260
same mistakes if we worked more on

782
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,950
figuring out how to code securely and

783
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,319
put in helpers there I mean when you're

784
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:10,560
writing applications you that's not your

785
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,119
main focus you're trying to make it work

786
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,160
and you're usually on a deadline so

787
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,130
building tools that assist in protecting

788
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,109
the source coder or making sure that

789
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:22,440
it's secure is very helpful and that's

790
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,569
really what we need because I don't

791
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:26,310
think anybody has time to sit down and

792
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,589
and poke through every single possible

793
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:33,540
function if you're if you're planning on

794
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,099
using cloud services know what you're

795
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,280
getting into know how the service works

796
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,930
play with it you know see if you can

797
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,579
twist it in some way it's not supposed

798
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,619
to our to make it do something that's

799
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,440
not supposed to do they may not like it

800
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,660
but you know as long as long as you

801
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,579
don't go breaking into anything it

802
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:51,990
shouldn't really be a problem a little

803
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,670
bit of scanning here and there and I

804
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,359
honestly most CSRF or cross-site

805
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,730
scripting vulnerabilities can can be

806
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,800
assessed without ever putting anything

807
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,410
malicious in there my favorite for

808
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,910
cross-site scripting is I've got a

809
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,190
little clown face like just out of

810
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,079
metacharacters and then I just look at

811
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,670
the source code which one's got through

812
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,980
could any of these break it and then you

813
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,260
know that's it's not malicious snorts

814
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,020
not gonna pick it up you know it's in

815
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,579
it's a good safe way to test things

816
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,230
because the worst thing that can happen

817
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,060
is you actually put in some type of

818
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,940
injection string and realize oh that

819
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,560
just hit everybody and like Sammy the

820
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,940
Sammy worm that's basically what that

821
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,520
guy did he was playing with it he was

822
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,160
testing different things and then it got

823
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,170
out of hand and once the code was out of

824
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,579
his hands and showing up on other

825
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,920
peoples pages he had no control at that

826
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,420
point except for just watching the ship

827
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,690
go down happened recently on reddit and

828
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,640
what was cool about that one is the guy

829
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,150
was posting in reddit programming so you

830
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,120
got to see

831
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,530
kind of the progression because he was

832
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,840
working on multiple people well then

833
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,330
they got it to work and next thing you

834
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,550
know the same statements being posted in

835
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,730
every single comment on reddit they were

836
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,140
a little cooler about it than myspace

837
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,900
was the guy apologized they said they

838
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,400
were cool with it they fixed the code

839
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,650
but if we if we do all this stuff then

840
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,600
you know hopefully one day we can have a

841
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,590
little less insecure cloud so thank you

842
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,620
very much Zuma have any questions or

843
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:34,620
comments all right oh go ahead

844
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,790
every

845
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:55,900
yes I I agree I agree but and I actually

846
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,289
tested this to death I scanned a bunch

847
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:01,690
of port 80 s on on amazon's cloud

848
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,230
network and just basically went to every

849
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,710
one of them using the using the the

850
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,130
domain the the ec2 kind of IP address

851
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,530
result domain and just checked out the

852
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,640
ones that that that would stay like if

853
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,289
you if you browse to it would it

854
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:22,089
override it with a domain name or would

855
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:27,339
it would it leave the name and that you

856
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:29,289
know that worked in some places the

857
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:33,099
downside of that is is you can you have

858
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:35,980
to crunch down both the domains so you

859
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,410
have to run JavaScript too so you have

860
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,819
to find a cross-site scripting hole in

861
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:42,010
that side as well that would allow you

862
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,500
to set the domain to just amazon AWS

863
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,170
calm and then you could do that on your

864
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,690
own cloud posted side and then yeah you

865
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,170
could do full-on communication between

866
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,559
using frames but but since that still

867
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,150
relies on another cross-site scripting

868
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,119
vulnerability you know it still needs

869
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,799
that problem so our still has that

870
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:09,160
problem so um keep going oh yeah I

871
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,559
always go too long all right well thank

872
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,599
you very much you know I'll be around so

873
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,920
if anybody has any questions let me know

874
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,020
