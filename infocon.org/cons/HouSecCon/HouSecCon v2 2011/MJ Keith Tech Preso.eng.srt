1
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,460
you

2
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,110
other went okay have the safety on okay

3
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,430
um I don't know who always here oh yeah

4
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,550
sorry forget that I'm not used to having

5
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,260
so many things that I'm kind of a hand

6
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,759
gesture you guys so so if you weren't

7
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,000
here this morning dude kind of a I guess

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,790
a non-technical talk about just kind of

9
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,100
like the threats I think that cloud

10
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,710
stuff can present and have a lot of

11
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,880
things that we talk about are definitely

12
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,490
risks but they're not really specific to

13
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,160
the cloud they're almost every one of

14
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,539
them you know you'll also see pop up and

15
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,979
locally hosted or your own data center

16
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,070
okay so this is a quick run-through if

17
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,550
you weren't there cloud environments do

18
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,519
at risk but that more comes from the

19
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,769
same type of exploits and problems that

20
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:24,260
we already know about but now you're

21
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,290
taking them and putting another web app

22
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,880
that you don't control on top of

23
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,920
everything else as far as you know just

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,900
the nature of web applications are

25
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,820
pretty much any type of software it's

26
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,280
going to have bugs in it and when you

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,320
start stacking them on top of each other

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,769
you're increasing your risk if people

29
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,840
fix the same old bugs that were aware of

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,120
because honestly I'd like some new bugs

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,269
to find but we just keep sticking with

32
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,160
the same old ones and replaying them on

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,390
new technology sass and framework as a

34
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,549
service they're hard to protect because

35
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,180
they allow a lot of customization one of

36
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,680
the big things about you know like

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,930
cross-site scripting that's somebody's

38
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,540
trying to get HTML or JavaScript to

39
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,650
execute on your site if you're allowing

40
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,200
them to add things you know if that's

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,640
the way it's supposed to work then how

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,440
do you really keep the bad code out or

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,269
just the poorly written code also a lot

44
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,209
of these services are completely open

45
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,940
source or allow demo accounts things

46
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,090
like that

47
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,940
and basically you can go through that

48
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,430
stuff you know I as an attacker can go

49
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,860
through and get a free account and if

50
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,760
you're using a bunch of like well-known

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
api's like say like Google Maps or

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,569
something like that I can study that

53
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,670
part of the source code if you have a

54
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,099
like full in-house application I can't

55
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,510
look at your source code I have to kind

56
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,180
of make educated guesses but when you're

57
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,670
when you're relying on these these kind

58
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,129
of openframeworks everybody can look at

59
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,959
that and therefore see parts of your

60
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,090
source code you can also get a free

61
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,090
account and test it see find

62
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,209
vulnerabilities and if you rely on the

63
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,728
base stuff more than likely the exploits

64
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,738
going to work on anybody that uses that

65
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,389
service as far as compliancy standards

66
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,039
that's what I kind of discussed earlier

67
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,550
is I don't really believe in compliancy

68
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,710
I think the as far as the standards if

69
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,389
you follow them you're probably going to

70
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,210
be more secure but compliancy doesn't

71
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,389
really get you out of anything you know

72
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,970
it's like we got hacked but but we're

73
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,740
compliant so does that get you out of it

74
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,210
also and something else to consider is

75
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,460
whenever you're giving your data to

76
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,690
somebody else which is basically what

77
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,780
you're doing here there's a lot of

78
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,669
agreements and you know documents that

79
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:01,620
say oh well we're going to take care of

80
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,590
this if you get popped the media doesn't

81
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,990
really care about that agreement you

82
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,690
know it's going to say you got hot so

83
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,729
we're that fault lies you know it's kind

84
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:16,919
of something that could be argued but I

85
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,780
think everybody should kind of just do

86
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,570
the best they can to secure it these are

87
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,250
essentially a couple of quotes that just

88
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,590
kind of made me think of this and oddly

89
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,990
enough my memory of it was incorrect I

90
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,639
thought it was add another layer of

91
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,849
abstraction when I when I looked this up

92
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,400
when I was putting the slides together

93
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,780
oddly enough in Wikipedia it says

94
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,669
commonly misquoted this way so that's

95
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:45,510
that's one of the things we're dealing

96
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,249
with is

97
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:47,869
every time you just add another layer

98
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,429
you think you're fixing something

99
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:51,109
eventually you just get to too many

100
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:55,539
layers they have problems did you do

101
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,989
compliancy issues these you know usually

102
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:02,239
have some sort of requirement if you're

103
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,369
using another service you have to verify

104
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:08,779
that other service is controlled that

105
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,189
you're if you're trusting them with

106
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:11,809
patient data if you're trusting them

107
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,819
with credit card data they kind of

108
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:16,939
become part of your chain and if they're

109
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:19,939
dropping the ball then you are so just

110
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:23,299
by proxy an example of this would would

111
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,399
be like parature which is a just common

112
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:30,259
crm i use burp constantly just just

113
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,419
doing regular things I'm stantly have

114
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:34,669
burp running and proxying all my

115
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:36,559
connections well I'm just sitting there

116
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,779
messing around parature one day all of a

117
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,179
sudden I start seeing these HTTP

118
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:43,999
requests going to a site that you know

119
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,859
I'm not really familiar with but its

120
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:48,859
spell check net so what was happening it

121
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:53,619
happening inside of this https secure

122
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:57,319
you know ticketing system is that they

123
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,719
any any type of communications that you

124
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,599
spell checked they were passing off over

125
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,169
HTTP to pair are two spell check net

126
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:08,269
they weren't using their own service so

127
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:10,939
therefore any communications if it can't

128
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,849
read credit card data patient data

129
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,709
anything like that you're just sending

130
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:19,159
it out over HTTP and of course that is a

131
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:23,629
threat but you know very difficult to

132
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,789
exploit it's one of those kind of like

133
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:27,409
theoretical things if you could somehow

134
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:29,899
get in between the two of them and you

135
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,699
know a lot of a lot of those types of

136
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,509
exploits or vulnerability generally if

137
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,279
you can pull those off I mean what's it

138
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,559
matter you you can control their dns or

139
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,449
something you can send everybody where

140
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:46,999
you want to you um when I was setting

141
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,329
this up I went around and basically just

142
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:52,449
looked at a bunch of different services

143
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,999
and this is where the resellers come in

144
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:58,249
and you don't always know that they're

145
00:07:58,249 --> 00:07:59,660
reselling something they're not

146
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,300
completely obvious about this when I

147
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,820
stumbled across this it was purely by

148
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,500
accident I was just signing up for as

149
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,360
many like you know free services or

150
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,360
cheap services as I could find so I go

151
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,440
to this place flash drive storage calm I

152
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,420
set up an account well I get a

153
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,580
confirmation email with the the password

154
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,160
that that I put on there they had very

155
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,110
very little as far as the password

156
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,830
complexity get my account back or a

157
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,240
little confirmation email with the

158
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,750
password in it then I decide to go check

159
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,820
out softlayer because they have free

160
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,330
cloud storage as well but they have much

161
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,530
more strict password complexity so I had

162
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,120
to create a different password from that

163
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,640
than my usual just you know repeating

164
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,140
the same characters over and over for

165
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,880
trash accounts basically when i when i

166
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,430
submitted that it came back and said

167
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,720
you're you have an order that's already

168
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,570
being processed well I'd never come any

169
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,880
nearly anywhere near softlayer i was on

170
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,950
a completely different site that was

171
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,310
offering its own service but but during

172
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,260
that set up since they had more

173
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,910
complexity i had to add you know

174
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,820
different characters and stuff like that

175
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,950
a couple minutes later i get an email

176
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,860
from the original place telling me my

177
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,860
account sman provision good to go but it

178
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,810
sends me the password that i tried to

179
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,510
create the SoftLayer account with this

180
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,010
is just some kind of weird bugginess

181
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,040
between their api or soft layers api and

182
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,110
flash drives there's some kind of timing

183
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,720
attack there where if I know your email

184
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,520
address and you're setting up an account

185
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,790
I can run over there and you know it

186
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,740
basically change your password and soft

187
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,530
layer before the accounts provision now

188
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,110
I'm this wouldn't wouldn't really do

189
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,130
much I mean they're still going to get

190
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,300
they're still going to get an email with

191
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,180
whatever password is set to and that's

192
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,430
the moment its provision so I mean you

193
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,700
know split-second timing maybe you can

194
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,370
get them to not check their email but

195
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,520
really these aren't they're not real

196
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,320
attacks there

197
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,060
they're in theory I can say I could do

198
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,890
this but honestly probably not going to

199
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,640
work but this is the kind of stuff that

200
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,520
you know inspires confidence yeah when

201
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,990
you start seeing strange behaviors like

202
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,030
this you're just really not sure if you

203
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,780
can put your faith in any of it did you

204
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,840
so as far as the the cloud goes from

205
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,970
like an attacker point of view what kind

206
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,020
of stuff are we looking at well I'm

207
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,540
essentially when okay you you end up

208
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,760
with a lot of people basically bragging

209
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,600
about who their customers are this

210
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,190
happens outside the cloud everybody does

211
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,440
this but some of these are really

212
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,770
getting out of hand this is Amazon's and

213
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,000
Salesforce actually has a search engine

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,850
you can actually narrow them down by

215
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,580
industry narrow them down by you know

216
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,910
size of company things like that and

217
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,080
there's some pretty big companies in it

218
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,000
this is the screenshots actually from

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,190
amazon though so these are these are

220
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,310
amazon services but the salesforce1 is

221
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,950
much nicer so um whenever you're dealing

222
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,960
with the reseller just like us talking

223
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,290
in the keynote you're stacking another

224
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,990
another web application or API on top of

225
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,140
another one on top of another one and

226
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,070
more than likely they're going to have

227
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,350
bugs in them and when you're dealing

228
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,790
with a reseller you're not dealing with

229
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,670
Amazon anymore or companies that have

230
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,450
the ability to write code securely and

231
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,790
you know have the money to invest into

232
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,830
doing it right so you end up with

233
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:57,250
problems see you okay this is just a

234
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,680
cloud database setup it's actually a

235
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,820
reseller essentially gives you the

236
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,310
option between it's on a rackspace

237
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,820
server or amazon you can set it up for

238
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,560
either but really all you get is

239
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,210
database access you don't really get

240
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,480
full on shell access they offer like PHP

241
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,050
admin to manage things if you're not

242
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,440
you're not fan of the command line

243
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,980
of huge fans of password complexity i I

244
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,260
don't I had to kind of improvised this

245
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,370
slide but basically only letters are

246
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,950
allowed is the the little line there and

247
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,930
and luckily I looked up on Wikipedia

248
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,350
there is actually a fear of numbers so

249
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,730
maybe that's the case I don't know

250
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,070
probably not probably just poor

251
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,380
validation I kind of wanted to see is

252
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,110
like well who says I can't put you know

253
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,500
a single quote in there or something but

254
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,550
that's when you start getting kind of

255
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,380
dangerous so essentially legend lets you

256
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,090
set this stuff up really quickly works

257
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,620
you know works pretty well I actually

258
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,930
kind of like it for testing so it's kind

259
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,579
of a shame I have to kick it but

260
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,380
basically it does these little Ajax

261
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,870
requests constantly and I realized that

262
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,060
the instance ID is the the value that

263
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,610
uses everywhere and I just kept getting

264
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,400
this like 2 318 well then actually who

265
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,130
all was at my house last night you do ok

266
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,800
uh yeah it's like I was just like oh my

267
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,370
god all of a sudden just change just

268
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,860
increment the number well now it's

269
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,890
providing me with your details I you

270
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,110
know I I was i think i was number like 2

271
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,410
318 so and you know we tried just a

272
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,420
couple of random numbers and then i set

273
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,980
up another account to get another

274
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,810
instance ID that that I could kind of

275
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,920
control because I didn't want to just

276
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,830
mess with random stuff and yeah sure

277
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,050
enough I can reset passwords across them

278
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,890
I can just get the information like if I

279
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,530
don't want to go through the trouble of

280
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,580
resetting your password or anything like

281
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,850
that so it gives you a lot of options

282
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,280
there unattended options but honest

283
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,420
options and yet you could if you wanted

284
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,100
to you could just basically go in there

285
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,380
just keep incrementing this number and

286
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,350
stealing data one after another and but

287
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,540
to be fair I think a lot of people were

288
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,910
kind of looking at this little sketchy

289
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,520
because most the database names that I

290
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,220
saw had tests somewhere in the name so I

291
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,510
think people were just signing at these

292
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,110
accounts

293
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,029
like yeah no I'm not gonna mess with

294
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:43,170
this all right so another interesting

295
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:48,510
thing to attack is sr CRMs they store a

296
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,029
lot of data they store some in some

297
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,920
cases they store the most important data

298
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,399
they've got all your client contacts

299
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,779
communications any content that's been

300
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,100
exchanged back and forth you know

301
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,500
basically no I wouldn't say like you

302
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,149
know the full keys of the kingdom like

303
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:07,589
if you cracked amazon's cloud or

304
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:10,529
something but it gives you a lot to play

305
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:14,250
with if especially if you're heavily

306
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,019
dependent on this as far as tickets

307
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,390
coming in and keeping track of things

308
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,390
okay so as far as their their CRM

309
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,060
service they also offer force calm it's

310
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,920
a free account essentially marketed to

311
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,269
developers because they don't they want

312
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,070
you to develop more stuff for their

313
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,880
their cloud service that you know you

314
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,320
can sell and they can provide to

315
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,390
customers and things like that there's

316
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,040
there's some funny things with this

317
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,149
though and this is this one you do

318
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:51,540
actually have to enable so this it's

319
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,089
pretty commonly enabled but it's not a

320
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,420
default configuration but it offers this

321
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,550
quick create function it's like if you

322
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,350
want if you wanted all of your people

323
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,640
when they're on the phone to make sure

324
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,740
they document everything make sure you

325
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,269
got a ticket for this person make sure

326
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,820
you added this contact that's what this

327
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,589
quick creates for it's just a couple

328
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:13,110
little boxes you know name phone number

329
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,690
email address that kind of stuff you

330
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,160
just click it and submit it well this is

331
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,170
this is honestly just I don't know why

332
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,240
more people aren't trying this but I

333
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,220
think it's over a year ago but I was

334
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,680
playing around with Facebook and they

335
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,360
use this post for my D if they're

336
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,110
cross-site request forgery prevention

337
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,149
well I tried different types of maybe

338
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,220
you know wild cards you know all kinds

339
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,380
of different stuff and then you know

340
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,000
kind of just out of desperation I just

341
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,649
removed the whole thing and the request

342
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,690
goes through Oh

343
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,010
okay I since then I've tried that quite

344
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,410
a few places you know most people look

345
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,370
at it up CSRF token leave that alone

346
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,600
honestly if you remove them a good deal

347
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,940
of time especially relating to a jack

348
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,849
stuff they go right through actually

349
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,900
Amazon's got a couple problems with this

350
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,780
ebay has a couple of problems with this

351
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,609
reddit used to and I wish I would have

352
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:12,750
done something with it because they

353
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,640
fixed it now because I thought it would

354
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,189
be hilarious to have like an upvote like

355
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:18,569
you know post something on there and

356
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,880
then everybody that clicks on it uploads

357
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,270
me but I kind of sat on it too long and

358
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,890
it got fixed did you do so yeah it helps

359
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,970
if you actually if you're going to use

360
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,920
them validated make sure that they're

361
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,690
actually submitting it don't just let it

362
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,710
go through without it um so yeah the the

363
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,350
creek quick create will you know allow

364
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,880
you to cross-site request forgery that

365
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,620
see it looks like some of the I don't

366
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,210
know what happened to my slide but our

367
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,970
slides but a bunch of God goofed up but

368
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,070
if you see the the confirmation token

369
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,350
that's their their version of CSRF

370
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,710
protection just move it or remove it and

371
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,620
you're good to go you can also just use

372
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,380
an auto post script and get somebody to

373
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,380
click on it and I don't know it's again

374
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,180
not really that malicious more just

375
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,130
annoying you can kind of flood them with

376
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,780
accounts if you wanted to just create

377
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,110
thousands of you know objects that they

378
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,570
have to deal with but I've actually got

379
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,830
a trick that will help you clear those

380
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,870
out really fast okay but but those

381
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,720
aren't really good enough and everybody

382
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,490
wants to see something a little more a

383
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,740
little more interesting plus I hate it

384
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,390
when people like just speculate about

385
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,300
exploits oh well this could happen this

386
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,910
you know maybe but prove it so I want to

387
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,170
talk a little bit about same origin

388
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,330
policy I don't know how many people are

389
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,890
familiar with it but this is what keeps

390
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,340
Ajax from when you're on facebook from

391
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,900
requesting data from bank of america

392
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,660
it basically the the javascript is only

393
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,510
allowed to act on the domains that it

394
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,030
comes from now if you include it as a

395
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,190
script that's fine because now you're

396
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,050
you're bringing it into your web page

397
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:14,120
but if you load up a web page on on say

398
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,480
Facebook and it tries to make an AJAX

399
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,860
request to wells fargo whatever it's

400
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,030
going to prevent that so I'm going to

401
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,030
let that happen and this is also with

402
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,920
frames things like that you can't just

403
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,710
add a frame underneath it and then use

404
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,390
your outer javascript to query

405
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,790
information on that frame unless they're

406
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,800
from the same domain to shoot so if

407
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,090
you're going to talk about Salesforce I

408
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,710
mean yeah you can annoy people by adding

409
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,330
accounts and stuff but what you really

410
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,610
want to get is the data you want to have

411
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,860
you want to gain that information so

412
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,120
there's a little trick with Salesforce

413
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,740
and actually a lot of ticketing systems

414
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,340
kind of have the same same issue most

415
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,410
people use it so that it listens to an

416
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,510
email address somebody sends an email to

417
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,720
that address it auto creates a ticket

418
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,220
you know there's a bunch of systems to

419
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,380
do that but you know Salesforce actually

420
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,120
does a pretty good job of handling that

421
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,100
stuff well if they have an attachment

422
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,720
hello all right so if you have an

423
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,639
attachment what do you do all right well

424
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,610
in sales forces case it takes it and it

425
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,789
stores that as well if you want to view

426
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,720
that that file it gives you you know you

427
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,850
just click on a link and it'll say do

428
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,279
you want to view this file you click yes

429
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,559
well it you know if it's an image it

430
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,799
just shows up on the page if it's HTML

431
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,590
or JavaScript it actually renders in

432
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,749
that site so but you know this is a

433
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,809
little too easy a little too exciting to

434
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:56,179
be honest it actually renders on instead

435
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,440
of salesforce com it renders on like d

436
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,019
content force com but that's cool we can

437
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:08,090
work with that so another kicker with

438
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,369
this kind of attack is that usually with

439
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,830
CSRF attacks you know oh I can get

440
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,389
somebody to click on it and I'm sure

441
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,129
it's easy to get people to click on

442
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:18,529
stuff all the time you know a lot of

443
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:19,879
people out there are just you know

444
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,309
clicking fools that's why nobody's ever

445
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:25,220
ready EULA you just click right through

446
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,609
it but when you start doing this stuff

447
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:31,100
to a ticketing system they have people

448
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,499
sitting there that it's their job to to

449
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:35,720
click on your link and and fall for your

450
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,440
exploit so it's it's a little little

451
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,480
meaner a little more malicious okay now

452
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,929
the internets are a little slow but

453
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:51,700
we're gonna try to do an example of this

454
00:21:53,350 --> 00:22:02,590
glue okay okay kill that

455
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,730
if he didn't like log me out or anything

456
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,400
okay I'm Josh familiar with with

457
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,100
Salesforce this is it's pretty much what

458
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,419
it looks like nothing too fancy and all

459
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:29,480
this terminal is is just a little web

460
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,309
server that I have listening on my

461
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:37,850
system okay so just to make fake targets

462
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:44,029
I've added a couple of these machine and

463
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,260
it's been hard to do behind me I've

464
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,909
added these just these like PD files and

465
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:57,950
what these PD files are is just they're

466
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,960
just they're just text files that say

467
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,059
private data one private data to stuff

468
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:08,710
like that so

469
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,000
ah

470
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,750
all right now um this is the same way

471
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:31,450
that now this is just I just call it

472
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:40,390
reporter but okay this is an attachment

473
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,400
that you know you could send from an

474
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,400
email or whatever to Salesforce and when

475
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,950
you know the whoever's looking at the

476
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,750
ticket scanner we're still here me trace

477
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,230
over here they would load this okay they

478
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,700
would look at the attachment that's so

479
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,610
important that they see and when they

480
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,620
see this as you can see it renders as

481
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,170
content de force so we can't just pull a

482
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,960
straight-up domain trick on it and say

483
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,870
now I'm part of the same domain also you

484
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,980
wouldn't have a button that kind of

485
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,690
gives it away now I'm going to try to

486
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,179
explain what happens here we're on we're

487
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:20,710
on force com okay so and this is you can

488
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,590
see the file download equal spot what

489
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,510
happens if you request a file that

490
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,270
doesn't exist you get an error page back

491
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,290
and that's your basically your default

492
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,120
default page you would be seeing if when

493
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,400
you first log in to Salesforce well

494
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,160
because it's so Ajax heavy all about and

495
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,090
this is another thing that makes it

496
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,170
really hard to cross that request

497
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,600
forgery they use objects for everything

498
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,970
so unless you know those objects you

499
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,620
can't necessarily make changes to them

500
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,500
but because of this bug it actually

501
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
sends a 500 error when you do this I can

502
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,760
make a ajax request to the same side I'm

503
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,179
on for a non-existent file it returns

504
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:04,570
that junk default page to me now when it

505
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,620
returns that junk default page I can now

506
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,980
I now have those those object ids and

507
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,360
since this is a site with a hosts all

508
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,510
the all the files i can now start

509
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,640
requesting those files legitimately

510
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,870
because they're all in the same domain

511
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,190
and you know it load the files up get

512
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,200
the data but what do you do with it at

513
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,320
that point well the easiest thing

514
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,139
is just to take that data encode it so

515
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:38,980
it is so it's like URL safe and then

516
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,899
write it back to the page as an image

517
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:44,200
link to another web server when and then

518
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,360
when it renders it's going to make that

519
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,429
request and actually send the data from

520
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:52,630
those files to to whatever web server

521
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:58,870
you tell it to do yes you'll see it in a

522
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,730
second well that's one of the reasons I

523
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,100
did little teeny one but I mean you and

524
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,289
it would just take a lot more well take

525
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:10,029
somebody better at javascript than me

526
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:13,929
probably but it can be done hopefully

527
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:15,820
the Internet's aren't killing me here a

528
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:25,200
test of the second ago but clicked it

529
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm sorry

530
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:45,260
anybody use the Salesforce see look at a

531
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,490
javascript pop-up should be good trying

532
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,560
to watch burp at the same time to make

533
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:58,220
sure it goes through okay request has

534
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,290
been made but not received yet so

535
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,010
nothing's like epic fail in front of a

536
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:13,590
bunch of people okay how much rice

537
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,740
without the proper what might that might

538
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,550
help the situation

539
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:30,609
there we go now we got some action okay

540
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:33,639
and this is again because I am terrible

541
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:35,830
at javascript I throw these little

542
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,629
alerts in here so I know what's

543
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:44,859
happening okay all right now as you can

544
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:47,879
see it refreshed the page and loaded and

545
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:50,409
if we look up here this is our little

546
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:52,599
web server that was listening now you

547
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,389
can see that you know private data file

548
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:57,339
one this is actually the contents of the

549
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,379
files and you can even do this with

550
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:01,570
images it would be really difficult

551
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,279
because you'd have to basically like

552
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,070
base64 encode the binary and then passed

553
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,539
across and it would be huge you're

554
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:11,499
correct and also I stole the cookie from

555
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:14,950
force calm so now if I mean you probably

556
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,629
wouldn't do all these attacks at once

557
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:18,999
you'd probably just gank the cookie and

558
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:21,849
have all the OID sent to you and then

559
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:23,469
you could actually just load that cookie

560
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:25,599
in your browser and take your time

561
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,479
browse them at your leisure but with

562
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,599
this you know you can actually see that

563
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,249
we're taking the day to the actual text

564
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:35,909
data from the files and moving them over

565
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:38,649
if you have like a CSV in there anything

566
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,139
like that would would be instantly

567
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:45,609
stolen yeah and like I said you know

568
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:47,200
since you got the cookies if you you

569
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,369
could actually just start guessing them

570
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:53,469
they today they're not incremental but

571
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:55,599
they tend to follow a pretty strict

572
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,239
standard we're like the first I think 13

573
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,399
characters are usually the same so you

574
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,570
could just start you know random

575
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:06,070
characters trying with a cookie so it

576
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,409
with that way you would actually be able

577
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:11,320
to steal every single file from that's

578
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,830
stored in Salesforce yes sir what's up

579
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:24,399
oh no no no it's uh it's actually HTTPS

580
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,290
uh-huh maybe not sure not to verify that

581
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,700
I didn't care i got the cookie it's hard

582
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,230
to really work that hard on stuff when

583
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,970
you already achieved the goal um okay so

584
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,040
that is basically you could send this

585
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,230
email to anybody that uses salesforce

586
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,710
and now you you just stolen which i've

587
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,240
got this limited to like just three but

588
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,010
you've now stolen every file they have

589
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:01,150
stored there now if you if you want to

590
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:06,429
be a real jerk and I do um what you can

591
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:11,710
get for is this is a hoot if y'all were

592
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,030
looking when I when I when I was kind of

593
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,820
going through these disappeared on me I

594
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,620
don't know there it is I have one name

595
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,570
destroyer this is this is because to

596
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,320
delete something in Salesforce all you

597
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,990
have to do is a get request and give it

598
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:40,210
the oid that's Eon oh yes the kicker the

599
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,710
thing that kind of cripples this exploit

600
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,390
a little bit the one I just showed you

601
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,880
is you're limited to documents that are

602
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,780
uploaded you can't actually steal steal

603
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,730
like you know account information things

604
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,929
like that but when we get that error

605
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,290
page we're actually getting a lot more

606
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,850
oids than just the files that are stored

607
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,210
there and because the the delete

608
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,770
function just really is a get request

609
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,990
with it I can pretty much do the same

610
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,670
trick grab every available oid convert

611
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,400
them all to image paths and rewrite that

612
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,980
to the screen me and then it makes those

613
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,270
requests when it makes those requests

614
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,900
well you see how there's several files

615
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,120
here I do have this limited a little bit

616
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,500
because I didn't know what happened if I

617
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:35,020
try to delete my own oid and well I was

618
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,670
a little nervous I don't like doing live

619
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,570
demos

620
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,570
they're cooler okay so now we're going

621
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,120
to do you file on this one and it's

622
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,900
Luton luton okay see and while that's

623
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,530
happening I can kind of show you this

624
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,400
because this is the actual little sneaky

625
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:03,130
request that that creates the error and

626
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,980
vary somewhat see that okay so I'm just

627
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,170
requesting the same like the file

628
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:13,680
download link but I'm also requesting

629
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,030
but I'm also requesting the are just a

630
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,650
bunch of a's which is like a nonexistent

631
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:31,810
non-existent object so we're making more

632
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:38,460
requests here okay see this one up here

633
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,260
okay so if we look at the response here

634
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,070
you actually see a did 500 error which

635
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,270
they're kind of surprised me because

636
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,920
usually for 500 errors you'll get like a

637
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,960
vague error message but if you look

638
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,170
through this every one of those long

639
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,790
numbers followed by a couple characters

640
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,550
those are all objects in you know your

641
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,850
Salesforce environment so all I really

642
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,260
have to do is basically just loop

643
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,380
through that data and start collecting

644
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,280
them and then make requests that that

645
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,380
I've used them in some way shape or form

646
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,940
whoops i got quasars or something all

647
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,040
right now let's try to request this guy

648
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,310
again hopefully

649
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,940
try again

650
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:32,290
next time I'll bring them my size

651
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,230
don't you hate it

652
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,289
there we go ok now I'm same deal here

653
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,480
you know of course you wouldn't have a

654
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,130
button for him to click but that would

655
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,659
be fun though you just felt like one

656
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,530
click me and see how many people you get

657
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,380
so we're going to click change content

658
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,240
and just the request goes through

659
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,679
correctly then we should start getting

660
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,080
popups again because again back to my

661
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,179
terrible javascript javascript there we

662
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,918
go ok so basically what it did is it

663
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,879
requested that same error page and I've

664
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,929
got it stripping all the recent recently

665
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,418
looked at objects which were kind of a

666
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:25,580
collection of different different files

667
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,168
and you know accounts and stuff like

668
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:29,699
that I mean it would have deleted itself

669
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,359
probably as well so let's just reload

670
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,469
this Plitt this page and we'll see what

671
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:40,009
we got left

672
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,660
like 30 percent of my talk is loading

673
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:55,228
you're a champ you can do it oh ok that

674
00:34:55,228 --> 00:35:00,779
didn't delete it hmm okay buggy let's

675
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:03,950
try this once more

676
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,360
yeah I think about half of my am of my

677
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,310
requests are just dropping so

678
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,589
let's try reloading this whole page

679
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:37,970
sorry for all the delays I didn't expect

680
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,760
this takes a lot and we're running out

681
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,990
my five minutes okay cool

682
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,269
okay um but basically what you could do

683
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:58,299
with this is uh just keep loading these

684
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:01,539
okay oh ok so now it magically worked

685
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:04,450
okay and as you can see everything's

686
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,200
been deleted yeah I think it might even

687
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,599
went a little further and killed this

688
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,920
stuff okay but that's not all I've got

689
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,779
more and luckily it'll fit in five

690
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:19,539
minutes okay let's jump back to my

691
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:24,900
slides real quick here I can find them

692
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,160
okay so if you can see that we're so the

693
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,230
record is deleted what was the little

694
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,340
message there check the recycle bin and

695
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,290
sure enough all those files will be in

696
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:49,190
the recycle bin but this just made me

697
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,980
really really laughs and actually those

698
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,300
you all that were at my house last night

699
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,750
this is the only post on the site that

700
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,540
doesn't at least fictionally use this

701
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,170
the CR SF token it doesn't even try to

702
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,740
use it on this it's a get request and I

703
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,230
mean and it can be loaded as an image so

704
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,360
really you could just litter that you

705
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,700
know ass image source to this all over

706
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,310
the internet and anybody logged into

707
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,050
Salesforce will be clearing out their

708
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:25,490
recycle bin and also the two means dump

709
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,820
everything in my corporate group if you

710
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,640
do one it just does your own so you

711
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,260
don't want to play with that have fun

712
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,060
okay do you have any questions maybe I

713
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,900
got like a couple minutes
