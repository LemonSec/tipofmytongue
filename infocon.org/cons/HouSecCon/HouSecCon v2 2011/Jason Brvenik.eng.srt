1
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,889
if you like you can all move to the

2
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:14,709
front as well just like in church you

3
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:17,878
know come on down

4
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,739
Oh looks like we've got who we're going

5
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,710
to have I'm Sam Denard one of the

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,469
volunteers it helps make in a is G and

7
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:32,920
Hugh set can go and just by way of

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,280
advertisement you can also share in that

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,820
joy we can use the help ok but at the

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,379
moment I'd like to introduce our next

11
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:45,460
speaker Jason breathnach he is an expert

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,649
in snort he is a source fire security

13
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,549
fellow he is a part of the Sourcefire

14
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:57,699
vulnerability research team and he used

15
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:02,320
to work for what is now two of the big 8

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,520
now that they've merged that exactly

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,909
okay he's well qualified to give us his

18
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:14,369
presentation today please welcome Jason

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,890
can you hear me the mic okay I have to

20
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,590
use the mic so snort how many people

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,800
here know it's nor it is and you used it

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,360
show hands actively use it all right so

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,430
we're here to talk about dynamic

24
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,000
security evolving world's kind of the

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,330
difference between how it used to be

26
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,570
done and how it's done today so you know

27
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,159
snort from days of old 1998 couple

28
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,470
signatures and that was life life was

29
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,479
good right he had little small networks

30
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,790
and we're about 30 attacks total you had

31
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,369
to worry about yeah maybe 10 years ago

32
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:07,330
was that today it's a far different

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,369
landscape how many vulnerabilities that

34
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,150
Microsoft patch in the last Tuesday

35
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,420
anyone wanted

36
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,000
30 ish and that's just one company Adobe

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,940
Oracle Mozilla everybody else says you

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,400
know 30 30 a month is about a norm for

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,740
any given product these days here's the

40
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,280
problem your network moves so fast and

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,560
the threats of all so quickly that you

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,610
can't use the old school fire-and-forget

43
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,970
ids IPS so a dynamic world that's what

44
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,830
we're living in if you were to look at

45
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,410
your network take a snapshot how many

46
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,790
people here scan their networks with a

47
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,850
Volm scanner or a you know and map or

48
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,910
something like that now if I can ask you

49
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,860
when you scan your network you do it

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,320
daily weekly monthly weekly how

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,320
different is it every week about the

52
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,910
same number of computers same number of

53
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,770
services same number of alms or does it

54
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,460
change constantly and then what do you

55
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,320
do so you found a new machine it's

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
windows XP hasn't been patched to you

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,490
call the helpdesk right and say hey you

58
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,870
got to fix this machine and then they

59
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,750
work on finding it and next week it's

60
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,830
probably still there and it probably

61
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,900
stays for two or three scan cycles and

62
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,540
then it disappears do you do anything

63
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,070
with your protection infrastructure in

64
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,350
that three-week window before they find

65
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,290
the Machine and and remediate it no you

66
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,710
can't here's the problem your network

67
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,320
changes too fast and exists in too many

68
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,960
places for you to actually physically

69
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,170
manually make adjustments and so that's

70
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,930
led us to these systems where first you

71
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,370
know just trust me I'll tell you what

72
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,530
you need to run all right set your

73
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,080
policies and leave them be we don't

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,600
believe that's appropriate we don't

75
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,090
believe it's effective either so that

76
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,680
you know machine that XP machine has

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,790
been in the network for three weeks

78
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,320
turns out it was a virtual machine on

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,000
some developers desktop and they were

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,590
testing something and you know they just

81
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,910
they were done and so they turned it off

82
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,790
and that's how finally disappeared right

83
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,769
cloud virtual endpoint challenges are so

84
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,839
dynamic that we can't as practitioners

85
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,480
hope to keep up with the change in our

86
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,780
networks you have a 2,000 person network

87
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,970
there's no way you couldn't staff 20

88
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,230
people to keep up with everything that

89
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,600
changes in their everyday right so you

90
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,020
need dynamic security we look at the

91
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,410
impact of kind of a static security

92
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,750
posture and a system that doesn't allow

93
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,060
you to adapt with the network you know

94
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,230
you might come up with some of these

95
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,570
words take a new person plug them into

96
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,040
your network and ask them to secure it

97
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,550
this is their first three months trying

98
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,430
to figure out what's happening wondering

99
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,710
why it's even happening if I could ask

100
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,330
another question how many people work at

101
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,890
companies that had networks established

102
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,730
for greater than 10 years and on those

103
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,919
networks how many people have been able

104
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,590
to totally refresh them come out with

105
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,250
brand new builds of things secure right

106
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,320
secure builds of operating systems and

107
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,580
software packages and everything else

108
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,100
you can't the company's just don't work

109
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,870
that way but bewilderment for the new

110
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,700
people that show up they why isn't this

111
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,830
set up so we face these powerful threats

112
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,880
hackers they're scary people aren't they

113
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,430
they're just like you and me by the way

114
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,300
right there just like you and me they

115
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,430
just have different motivations the

116
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,560
problem is they have lots of things that

117
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,150
they can work from and they come in many

118
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,210
forms let's look at hackers script

119
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,860
kiddies advanced persistent threats how

120
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,400
many people love apt in a great term apt

121
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,560
do you think it's a real problem for

122
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,350
commercial entities yes no do you lose

123
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,160
sleep over it there's a hacker in my

124
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,539
network how many people think their

125
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:06,320
networks are currently compromised how

126
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,370
many people think their networks will

127
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,910
always be compromised yeah what's our

128
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,250
job in doing security and a network that

129
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,890
we accept is constantly compromised hmm

130
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,480
well

131
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,430
it'sit's to minimize the amount of risk

132
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,810
and what they're able to get away with

133
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,730
right you're never going to get them out

134
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,790
of your network why because they're

135
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,820
focused organized innovative they're not

136
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,340
encumbered by process and change control

137
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,220
they're not encumbered by up time

138
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,420
they're not uncover encumbered by PL

139
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,060
they need something they do something

140
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,900
they want to change the way they

141
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,520
approach a target they change the way

142
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,750
they approach to target they don't have

143
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,160
to go change Control Board to release a

144
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,130
new attack drop new code on you they're

145
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,620
also relentless they get bonuses just

146
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,800
like we do right you achieve your goal

147
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,870
you need to compromise our essay i'll

148
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,790
give you an extra fifty thousand dollars

149
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,760
this quarter go do it take it 50k with

150
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,050
and compromise our essay right it's

151
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,300
pretty motivating form i don't know if

152
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,490
that's a real number or not but it's

153
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,750
still pretty motivating when you think

154
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,600
about it they have a salary and so we

155
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,630
deploy these technologies AV and IPS and

156
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,850
firewall and proxies and all this other

157
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,890
stuff and what happens i love the quote

158
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:30,380
right the better we get more deviant and

159
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,160
creative thicket and this is essentially

160
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,640
what we're dealing with we're trying to

161
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,060
protect our networks with walls it

162
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,740
doesn't really work but this is in

163
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,000
essence modern-day defense for networks

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,860
we build it we put it in believe it be

165
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,100
doesn't work well and it's driven by

166
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,980
black box solutions systems you set them

167
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,530
up you plug them in you click a couple

168
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,560
default settings you say go and then you

169
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,000
wait for events and you call the help

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,400
desk and they fix things and you know

171
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
you might have an incident or two you

172
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,790
deal with you have to deploy patches and

173
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,920
everything else right but that's a

174
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,790
losing game the system itself needs to

175
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,860
know what to protect and the threats you

176
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,440
face in order to have a hope of winning

177
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,529
can anybody tell me in the last

178
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,639
Microsoft Tuesday how quickly that got

179
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,469
deployed the network the patches on

180
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:42,809
average a week a day sorry seven days

181
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,949
how long does it take an attacker to

182
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,930
turn that patch into exploitable

183
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:53,980
conditions for hours yes binary code for

184
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,350
hours what what just happened did we win

185
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:06,699
oh no we absolutely lost this game so it

186
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:08,259
takes us seven days to get the patch

187
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:10,810
deployed and we had to test it make sure

188
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,189
it didn't break anything even though it

189
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:13,449
still breaks things when you deploy it

190
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,910
and it took the attacker four hours to

191
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,910
turn it into usable exploitation so

192
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,040
let's just say six days of delta what

193
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,990
are you doing those six days JV help you

194
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,800
Fire will help you do you increase

195
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:36,220
monitoring but what do you do okay well

196
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,339
in our ideal world we've got coverage in

197
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,130
well the moment the patch is released in

198
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,829
products whether it be a firewall or the

199
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:46,990
next-gen firewall says they call them or

200
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,459
the IPS but here's the next problem if a

201
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,500
vulnerability effects windows XP and

202
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,350
Windows 2000 but not you know windows 7

203
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,350
what do you do you turn it on for

204
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,790
everything how many people have

205
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,120
experienced a false positive come on I

206
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,480
know I have how many experienced the

207
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,649
false positives took out a business

208
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:15,040
critical application I have all right so

209
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,410
having the system know where the

210
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,199
vulnerabilities are and automatically

211
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,149
enable protections are what we believe

212
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,540
the ideal situation is it can recommend

213
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,610
to you what should be done it could act

214
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,240
upon it on its own and do it most people

215
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,199
aren't quite comfortable with that yet

216
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,430
it takes them a couple months before

217
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,230
they accept that right

218
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,160
and in the absence of that we have to

219
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,090
assume our people are what well we

220
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,190
already disprove this there's no way

221
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,270
that you even having the tools can be as

222
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,870
vigilant responsive as your adversaries

223
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,890
seven days to get a patch on your

224
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,420
network four hours for him to turn it

225
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,010
into something useful for him right it

226
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,150
leads us to the fundamental question

227
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,130
right is it a fair fight it's building

228
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,440
walls good in an age where we have Jets

229
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,060
the attackers are flying jets right over

230
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,370
our walls shooting into our castle

231
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,560
courtyards all right it since no longer

232
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,700
land-based attack they're no longer

233
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,860
coming in the door and taking pieces of

234
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,750
paper off the printer although i think

235
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,980
printers are the greatest things to

236
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,210
compromise in the network by the way

237
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,920
what's the last time you patched a

238
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:34,060
printer anybody know what is a printer

239
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,510
typically run what's its operating

240
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,440
system usually some form of linux does

241
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,060
it have a web browser or a web server

242
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,560
i'm sorry ftp telnet big hard drive and

243
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,150
where do all the important documents in

244
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,290
a company end up going to the fancy

245
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,830
printer all right every contract goes

246
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,450
through that fancy printer to when they

247
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,830
put it down they scan it so they can

248
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,250
electronically file it and we never

249
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,030
patch them in your security technologies

250
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,520
whether it be knack or a fee or IPS or

251
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,560
firewall is there some selection for HP

252
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,270
printers I want to protect my printers

253
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,570
no would you put in IPS in front of your

254
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,950
printer and just turn on all the rules

255
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,590
anybody know

256
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,740
a smart enough system modern defenses

257
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,540
that you could bring to the table we

258
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,620
refer to them as next-generation IPS

259
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,600
would know that printer is running

260
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,430
Apache and what version of apache it is

261
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,710
it would know that it's linux based it

262
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,020
would know that it offers ftp it would

263
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,480
know that it offers telnet it would know

264
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,860
what the associated vulnerabilities for

265
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,660
those versions are in that operating

266
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,300
system and would turn on just protection

267
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,050
for those things and it would do that it

268
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,640
would minimize your business risk of

269
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,770
having an IPS in the network where

270
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,890
things get printed what happens when a

271
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,210
printer breaks in a network by the way

272
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,380
anybody here work I helped us it has to

273
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,160
deal with that any time in their life

274
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,570
when the printer isn't working you get

275
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,440
lots of calls and the problem to the

276
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,110
business is they feel like business

277
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,430
can't be done because they can't print

278
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,500
stuff it's you know high priority

279
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,580
everybody knows your problems the

280
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,770
highest priority there is so if you put

281
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,180
a system in place that isn't aware of

282
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,680
this and it starts doing things like

283
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,350
blocking windows-based attacks for a

284
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,300
linux-based target that is your printer

285
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,030
then you run into that mix of

286
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,250
false-positive right because it's not

287
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,540
really a false positive it couldn't be

288
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,550
any vulnerability exploited it's a Linux

289
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,400
machine so a system that knows it it

290
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,020
knows the users in those two behaviors

291
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,390
and those the operating systems allows

292
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,490
you to overlay a policy on that so they

293
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,760
can adapt on its own would be ideal a

294
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,470
sequel slammer everybody remember sequel

295
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,900
slammer anybody how about what's Code

296
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,330
Red I bet today you still have Code Red

297
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,210
offense on your border anybody have an

298
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,680
IDs out there that kind of alerts you to

299
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:21,640
it how many do you get it day a lot this

300
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,400
is a decade old threat only affects

301
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
windows only affects mt and I is was it

302
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,150
50 I think 40 50 still out there that

303
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,490
tells us how vigilant responses people

304
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,460
are by the way 10 year old vulnerability

305
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,940
existing and still haunting the internet

306
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,220
if you were to deploy a machine that

307
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,020
were vulnerable today you would be

308
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,230
compromised within minutes problem is

309
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,240
they're all valid events they're all

310
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,100
valid attacks they really did happen

311
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,450
they just weren't successful right so in

312
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,040
your classic incident response cycle

313
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,390
you've got a hundred thousand of these

314
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,610
things a day that you would have to go

315
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,550
investigate if you were really looking

316
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,380
at all of the real attacks that happen

317
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,960
on the network if you didn't have the

318
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,710
context of a windows machine or the XP

319
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,980
or and t4 running iis as the target or

320
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,690
it was a Linux target or an Apache

321
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,130
target you would in essence be forced to

322
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,510
do what we do today which is ignore

323
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,130
those events because well I don't know

324
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,450
if anything was wrong about nothing else

325
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,600
changed right until the developer starts

326
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,680
that vm to try something on so we think

327
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,040
next-gen IPS by the way how many people

328
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,430
have heard of RNA real-time network

329
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,980
awareness it kind of dries our IPS Tech

330
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,830
in that it observes the network it

331
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,200
notices all these things services users

332
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,630
ports protocols applications operating

333
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,250
systems and creates these vulnerability

334
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,810
maps right and empowers the system to

335
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,250
make these changes but that's not good

336
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,200
enough yeah you have to be able to do it

337
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,340
fast all right you have to these are NSS

338
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,230
data points i believe from the last

339
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,260
group test if the system ends up slowing

340
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,200
the network what happens to it it's

341
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,020
turned off just like a fee on the

342
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,930
desktop right if you can't catch a job

343
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,130
done you end up turning it off and then

344
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,020
everybody loses you got to have strong

345
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,690
performance while you do it and it needs

346
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,950
to be accurate it needs to cut out your

347
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,450
hundred thousand events needs to make

348
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,220
them the one event that matters the two

349
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,320
events that matter right that's what we

350
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,830
believe is appropriate it needs to have

351
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,980
the best detection possible now we think

352
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,290
we have that it's been verified through

353
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,760
consistent testing with independent labs

354
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,640
however that's not enough just knowing

355
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,170
about the attacks and stopping the

356
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,870
attacks not enough especially in today's

357
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,030
world I think the last presenter talked

358
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,040
about

359
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,259
Facebook and the threats it represents

360
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,519
how many people have a corporate policy

361
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,050
against social networking for the

362
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,639
average employee 1234 yeah are you able

363
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,199
to enforce it yeah kind of maybe you can

364
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,549
enforce it you get fired well that's one

365
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:12,829
way to enforce it do you even know if

366
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,679
they're doing it yeah what about

367
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,720
web-based email no no policy guess what

368
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,349
based email I love this by the way can't

369
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,179
send an attachment because my email

370
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,940
system says it's too big can't send an

371
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,710
attachment because my email system says

372
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,169
it's in a disallowed file type what

373
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:38,150
employees do what they do they log into

374
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,059
their yahoo mail or their Gmail and they

375
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,429
send it that way or the contract and and

376
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,440
your system rejects it how many people

377
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,610
have witnessed this in the security

378
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,730
space witnessed this happen persons

379
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,929
trying to do business with another

380
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:52,760
organization a few contracts back and

381
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,370
forth the other organization maybe they

382
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,110
were compromised maybe they the word

383
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,659
document does have a virus in it right

384
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:03,980
and your gateway blocks it that virus we

385
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,860
got protections can't help you deadlines

386
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,809
quarters coming to an end got to get

387
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:10,250
this contract signs for the business can

388
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,230
move forward what does your employee do

389
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,580
I don't care send it's my personal email

390
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,200
send it over to gmail I'll download it

391
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,990
from there all right and they execute

392
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,760
the contract and they get infected just

393
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,450
like everything else you need to be able

394
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,520
to cover the application specifically

395
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,460
that you think are appropriate for your

396
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,730
business and while it's a policy

397
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,740
enforcement point it reduces your threat

398
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,700
posture so instead of saying Facebook's

399
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,870
not allowed but I really can't do

400
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,400
anything about it gmail is not allowed

401
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,799
but I can't do anything about it we only

402
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,419
run windows on our network we only run

403
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,610
Linux we only run mac whatever our data

404
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,080
center doesn't run anything older than

405
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,720
you know windows 2000 and having no way

406
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,760
to enforce that or even be aware that

407
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,640
it's different the system should let you

408
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,179
know it should also bring us to the next

409
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:05,059
point which is next-gen firewall allow

410
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:05,870
you to in

411
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,559
forsett it should allow you to know that

412
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,700
a person in accounting will be working

413
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,450
with the outsourced oracle instances and

414
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,010
person sales only be working with

415
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,860
salesforce or whatever your CRM is right

416
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,190
we should allow you to know that

417
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,480
Facebook is allowed for the marketing

418
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,980
department because they have to do their

419
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,660
social media campaigns but it's not

420
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,210
allowed for your sales team and it

421
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,460
should allow you to make those decisions

422
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,210
so I'm not so sure oh did display fine

423
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,840
okay all right we're coming to market

424
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,900
with it I think it releases in a month

425
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,179
next-gen firewall now it's based on IPS

426
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:49,670
technologies right the best IPS

427
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,990
available in the market is kind of the

428
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,559
core threat prevention engine

429
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,790
firewalling itself like another slide

430
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,429
that illustrates as well we believe that

431
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,300
the to work very well together now we

432
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,210
don't believe that one will replace the

433
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,179
other how many people here if the

434
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:10,130
perfect firewall existed today that

435
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,620
could do IPS application control

436
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,470
standard firewalling at the border in

437
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,110
VPN and all those things would replace

438
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,410
their existing firewalls for it oh and

439
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,200
we're free I gave it to you would you

440
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,740
replace all your firewalls know so you

441
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,860
need a transition path so right now

442
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,390
people start think but you guys are the

443
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,490
snort people you two IPS firewalls I

444
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,510
think this is a great graphic for

445
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,050
representing it next to in firewall

446
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,500
defined as classic firewall stateful

447
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,840
firewall I guess is the way to refer to

448
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,210
it no do you guys think stateful

449
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:55,460
firewalls work anybody our firewalls a

450
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:01,429
security device yeah I don't think they

451
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,580
are I really don't especially in today's

452
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,730
world firewalls are more of a access

453
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,540
control device not so much security

454
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,490
they're more of a you must be this tall

455
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,030
to ride this ride bar HTTP is the new

456
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,410
tcp if you

457
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,330
missed the memo right everything runs

458
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,550
over port 80 and 443 today VPN security

459
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,130
device NAT security device access

460
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,820
control operational what are they right

461
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,130
they're filtering devices for very basic

462
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,030
stuff app control IPS however are

463
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,460
different and this graphic attempts to

464
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,050
illustrate the level of difficulty in

465
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,290
doing stateful firewall pretty easy

466
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,830
green app control you could probably do

467
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,420
app control if you wanted to think about

468
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,740
the level of effort data inspected in as

469
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,120
the first hundred and twenty eight bytes

470
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,530
of every packet would probably tell you

471
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,110
all you needed to do for application

472
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,560
control IPS not so much you have to

473
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
inspect every bite of every packet of

474
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,120
every day right there there's no

475
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,280
singular good packet you don't have to

476
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,180
look at we'd like to think there is but

477
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,980
there isn't and so in level of

478
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,230
difficulty we've got already the vast

479
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,970
majority of a handle we need to add some

480
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,510
staple firewalling features an overlay a

481
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,420
policy that makes sense to firewall

482
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,620
groups operational groups that maintain

483
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,630
policy enforcement not security groups

484
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,460
that do incident response and threat

485
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,160
mitigation and then we have another

486
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,430
piece that fits into our overall

487
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,440
strategy which is immunity has anyone

488
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,200
heard of any net how about clam AV

489
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,960
anybody yeah one to claim of ease our

490
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,300
open source AV product two runs on the

491
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,950
vast majority of male gateways out there

492
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,440
Emmy net is an endpoint protection

493
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,020
product we call it malware control I

494
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,540
guess their mission reinvent endpoint

495
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,600
defense how many people run AV in our

496
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,470
company I do how many people think it's

497
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,950
effective

498
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:22,309
AV deployment stopped something say why

499
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,740
daily how many times do you still have

500
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,300
to respond to new viruses daily some

501
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,240
stats I'll share with you 48 to 50

502
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,760
percent effectiveness for any given AV

503
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,940
and if you think about the process you

504
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,210
can understand why let's say you are

505
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,920
patient zero for some new threat

506
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,940
suddenly worm what do you do you upload

507
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,110
it to your AV vendor yeah virustotal

508
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,020
maybe all comes back negative negative

509
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,790
negative negative maybe somebody comes

510
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,250
back with heuristic detect on it then

511
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,660
what happens maybe vendor sits on it

512
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,860
they wait for other people to come up

513
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,790
with it but another stat for you

514
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,309
seventy-eight percent of malware that is

515
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:15,950
observed today is unique to its target

516
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,429
so they never see additional infections

517
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:21,929
you're only ever going to see it once in

518
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:25,860
one place at one time so the traditional

519
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,050
method of bubbling up the quote

520
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:36,000
high-risk threats doesn't work why is it

521
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,410
different how can it be done differently

522
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,080
that's what I mean I wanted to look at

523
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,490
we picked them up in January because I

524
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,710
think well clearly we thought they were

525
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,090
doing it right cloud-based real-time

526
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:53,100
updates 300ma 100 Meg gigabit how big

527
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,020
are your virus definitions on average

528
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,000
okay I'd say an average is 100 mega

529
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,760
updated day for AV if you're staying on

530
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,860
top of it it's a lot of data to push

531
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,990
around on your network and if we take

532
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,299
patch management as an example there's

533
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:12,590
going to be a 30-percent failure rate

534
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,490
and deploying them and this is an update

535
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,620
that happened after things got bubbled

536
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,090
up remember seventy-eight percent of it

537
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,330
never going to be seen in your network

538
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,100
there's a way we think to do this

539
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,770
without having to push out updates to be

540
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,450
real time what we call collective

541
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,840
immunity we should exist with existing

542
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,330
AV because really nobody wants to pull

543
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,380
out their 80 anymore and they want to

544
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,990
pull out a firewall we should make it

545
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,940
customizable personalized protections

546
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,480
kind of core to our being and we should

547
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,750
make it so that communities of people

548
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,870
share protections if you will so think

549
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,220
about think about how the apt threat I

550
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,710
hate to use apt but think about how that

551
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,679
thread propagates through network if if

552
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:03,080
you're an attacker and you have to

553
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,850
compromise the network and all your

554
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,260
tricks have failed and you need to bring

555
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,600
out a new owed a never-before-seen

556
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,250
never-before-released but you need to do

557
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,660
it to win you want to get into our essay

558
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,710
and win you're going to burn it if

559
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,970
you're going to burn it in our say or

560
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,179
you're going to burn it elsewhere

561
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:22,100
probably all right if I burn it once I

562
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,410
lines will get my value out of it and if

563
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,630
you have a campaign against I don't know

564
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,960
government contractors you think maybe

565
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,309
you'll burn the same o day at all of

566
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:34,910
them at the same time right if I got a

567
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,429
compromise Lockheed and Grumman and all

568
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,320
these guys almost I'm gonna use the same

569
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,850
one over and over until it's it's

570
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,280
patched because I've really only have 14

571
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,280
days from the time I start to the time

572
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,929
it gets discovered communities of like

573
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:52,070
organizations tend to see similar

574
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,750
infection vectors is kind of the

575
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,970
fundamentals so I think this is an

576
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,309
animated graphic of how ultimately how

577
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:00,880
it's different you're classy Gabey agent

578
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,210
right 32 32 350 makes in size with a gig

579
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,840
of definitions on your desktop new file

580
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,309
gets scanned right perhaps we'll do it

581
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:18,029
DNS requests to the internet right and

582
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:21,270
it's a one-to-one match a one-to-one

583
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,809
match meaning i took a sha or an md5 I

584
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,900
did dns query I got an answer back or I

585
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,789
like maybe not found means it's good and

586
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:32,480
well I found it so it's not good right

587
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,250
classic AV model not going to work so

588
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,620
well when we overlay the way we do it

589
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,270
it's a little bit different I'll have to

590
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,049
explain this to you one to one we have

591
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:46,919
Shaw matching prevalence so if we know

592
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,220
seventy eight percent of all malware is

593
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,600
unique then if we only ever see one

594
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,490
binary one nobody else has it it's a

595
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,159
good or bad I just flip a coin what are

596
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,179
my chances of being correct alright if I

597
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,520
just say all new things are bad I have a

598
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,640
seventy percent chance of being right

599
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,779
that's thirty percent better than my

600
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,580
existing technologies all I did was say

601
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,490
it's bad if I see it in three hundred

602
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,980
places three thousand three million then

603
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,960
I know it's probably good I didn't do

604
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,490
anything other than look at how many

605
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,250
people have this binary right temporal

606
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,220
how fast is it moving generics cuz i

607
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,659
recall i think is another key element

608
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,210
though but before i get the cloud recall

609
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,539
let's talk about how a typical response

610
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,789
would work you are on your computer you

611
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,279
go to a web page dropper happens things

612
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,700
happen my agent sees it it sees do stuff

613
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,090
get installed but nothing changes so we

614
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,940
say okay allow it to run we're going to

615
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,809
let it be you're going to be patient

616
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:56,880
zero and we're just going to observe and

617
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,669
then all of a sudden your machines start

618
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:01,799
sending emails to all your friends all

619
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,929
your friends start having the same

620
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:08,130
binary downloaded well we know that it's

621
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,760
moving fast and that it's doing things

622
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,179
automatically downloading for you we can

623
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,250
now take cloud recall and say even

624
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,240
though I allowed it to run on your

625
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,669
machine and these 50 other people had no

626
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:22,100
knowledge

627
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,669
of you know badness I'm now determining

628
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:27,470
it's bad I'm reversing my decision is

629
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,000
saying no good remove it right so things

630
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,549
like dancing baby everybody remember the

631
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:37,130
dancing baby video I think was awesome

632
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,970
wasn't it how fast did that move among

633
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,650
your family and friends and everything

634
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,410
else I got I think it was an hour before

635
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,490
the whole company was looking at the

636
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,309
same video back in the day if that were

637
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:52,400
a virus today a worm a drop or a Trojan

638
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,620
whatever you would have an entire

639
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,270
company in probably an hour and a half

640
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,100
classic a ve wouldn't know about it

641
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,620
because nobody uploaded it yet now you

642
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,880
got a week before you get a real

643
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,260
definition that says it's bad and the

644
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,549
attacker has been on your network for a

645
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:11,409
week cloud recall allows us to see that

646
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,390
change in the behavior and immediately

647
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,799
determine that we're going to block it

648
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,110
and uninstall it so instead of a week

649
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,730
from the time somebody uploads it to you

650
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,309
get your definitions and it gets removed

651
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:25,010
we can in minutes right we see that this

652
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,510
instance here turned into a hundred

653
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,250
thousand instances we decide it's bad

654
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,590
everybody's throwing the agent can now

655
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,600
be informed that this is no longer good

656
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,340
we uninstall it for you kind of kind of

657
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:43,370
neat I think comparisons I think this is

658
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:48,020
the obligatory chart of feature function

659
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,380
right one day to a month for sample

660
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,590
collection a data two weeks has anybody

661
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,750
ever uploaded a sample to a Navy vendor

662
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,010
and gotten a response of the day I

663
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,480
haven't but I don't have those big fancy

664
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,400
contracts with them either it's possible

665
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,929
an hour to a day to publish once it's

666
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:13,370
out and up to 350 makes and footprint we

667
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,360
like to keep things real light real

668
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,700
simple 200 millisecond response time by

669
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,620
the way from the cloud so that the

670
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,789
common question is will if all your

671
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:21,080
queries are go into the cloud and you do

672
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,640
this recall stuff and everything else

673
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,370
isn't going to slow down my machine and

674
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,230
my response to that is the machines

675
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,210
already slow for maybe scanning a

676
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,679
gigabit definition for every execution

677
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:33,200
document opened is slow I give you a

678
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,780
response to 200 milliseconds

679
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,120
and it is relevant relevant to the

680
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,710
entire user base whether it be your

681
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,690
organization or the world as a whole and

682
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,530
make decisions pretty quickly we're

683
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,650
bringing it to the enterprise web based

684
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,510
management group policies all that stuff

685
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,640
right but if you break down all of this

686
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,580
what we believe is that this is the

687
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,170
right solution that the cloud if you

688
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,100
will the network will bring a collective

689
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,460
immunity to people that you can

690
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,880
ultimately share relevant information so

691
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,820
that everybody becomes protected at once

692
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,990
instead of everybody having to take

693
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,230
action to get protection does that make

694
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:22,840
sense I shouldn't have to give you that

695
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,160
updates I shouldn't have to give you

696
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,560
signature updates the system should be

697
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,180
able to subscribe to these things and

698
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,100
know that they're happening and based on

699
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,290
some real simple observations we should

700
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,480
be able to make appropriate decisions

701
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,310
for your network that's what we call

702
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,890
next generation we refer to it as you

703
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,740
know cloud two core protection I really

704
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,330
its cloud to endpoint protection but

705
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,010
right so are there any questions about

706
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,740
what I said is everybody falling asleep

707
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:59,340
yet lost or Hungary yes

708
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:10,419
starting at one

709
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:13,840
great we're able to track update agents

710
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,090
and see the binaries are drops through

711
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,720
updaters you know like boom SMS we're

712
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,869
able to allow organizations to create

713
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:24,759
custom so you might find your binary you

714
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,649
might say this is whitelisted there's a

715
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:28,480
number of actions you can take on that

716
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,389
through the console to handle it we

717
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:33,029
would see that it's localized to you

718
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:35,649
that it was built by one of our people

719
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:36,999
through a compiler and all kinds of

720
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:39,970
different stuff right when you get to

721
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,470
the edge cases like that there's

722
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,590
certainly situations right that you

723
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,049
might want to see however how many

724
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:51,090
people run custom applications right and

725
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,649
how many people install them in random

726
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:58,840
locations not many you know what your

727
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,029
application is you know that it should

728
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:02,499
be whitelisted you know there should be

729
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,690
allowed to run you put your whitelist up

730
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,840
you go deploy and it's only local to you

731
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,399
if that application shows up somewhere

732
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,750
else they don't get the white listing

733
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:18,359
for it makes sense other questions

734
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,299
anybody nobody yes

735
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:31,280
sure so the decisions are cached there

736
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,199
is a climb AV engine in the background

737
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,849
if you want to have classic AV

738
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:36,469
definitions that you can use you can

739
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:41,119
download those I'm simply going to say

740
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,859
though that I don't believe that there's

741
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:45,829
any system that's truly offline and what

742
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:47,629
I mean by that is it wouldn't be a

743
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,879
threat if we're offline you could block

744
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,730
it out on otherwise right if you have to

745
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,149
deploy local highly constrained black

746
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:57,380
lists and white list right that's where

747
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,810
the customization comes in a SCADA

748
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,450
systems fairly static it all should be

749
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,630
fairly static right it should have very

750
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,480
well-known environmental that you can

751
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,030
whitelist and then creeped out right

752
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,950
policy nothing new is allowed until I

753
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,960
change it and allow those decisions to

754
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,460
be cached the problem is let's say I

755
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,859
don't know the the more common question

756
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:24,200
around that is you know laptops they're

757
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,550
at work they're plugged in we're doing

758
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,560
our work and then we leave and we're on

759
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,599
the road we're doing presentations like

760
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,970
this right here somebody hands you a USB

761
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,680
stick and you check it out you plug in

762
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,030
your machine became infected and you

763
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,890
weren't connected to a network so you

764
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,740
were unable to check for new definitions

765
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,000
right well it can't connect to anything

766
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,430
and steal data from you at the moment

767
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,470
when you do connect to the network

768
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,000
you'll immediately be query on it right

769
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,130
so you have a couple seconds while

770
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,780
you're on the network that it could do

771
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,630
something before the cloud becomes aware

772
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,319
of it and can make a decision on so you

773
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,940
know there's definitely edge cases where

774
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,589
it's not the perfect solution but I'll

775
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:04,730
argue there is no perfect solution

776
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,260
especially in the static war that we

777
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,569
deal with today makes sense any other

778
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,960
questions

779
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,609
alright well thanks for listening we're

780
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:22,470
letting me listen by letting me ramble
