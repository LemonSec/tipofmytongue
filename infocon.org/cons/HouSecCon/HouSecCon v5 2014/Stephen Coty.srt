1
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:14,190
can I have your attention please welcome
to track to

2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,080
for you sick time

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,659
for HP so forth by one on demand and
I'll be your host for a track to today

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,240
there's anything I can do for your
listening pleasure

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,959
please let me know arm we're just about
ready to begin

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,730
I'd like to introduce our our speaker
Steven Cody

7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,980
he is the chief

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,910
security evangelist at alert logic in a
member of Issa

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,760
in for guard in HTC I A ice

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,059
research has been his primary focus and
passion since

11
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:57,540
2007 and I he's an experienced speaker
having presented

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,229
at Orsay conferences I AWAs reinvent

13
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,940
US Cyber Crime conference and others
he's been working in

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,270
security since goodness only knows when
1992

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,298
he's going to speak to us today when
forensics and incident response

16
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,520
how's everyone doing this morning

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,610
yeah all right let's do this so here

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,039
up does forensics as a friends are some
Vesta Gator or

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,550
have any of you guys dealt with in cloud
environments your

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,649
yes snow yes for few okay

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,990
who has deployments in the cloud my the

22
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,490
excellent so this might apply to a lot
of so

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,149
call so arm for instance in the cloud is
a little different beast than

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,530
traditional forensics

25
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,100
and the sooner you realize that this is
the easier your job as a investigator

26
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,479
or just as a security professionals
gonna be as we've seen throughout the

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,890
years you know cloud

28
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,840
is becoming more and more place for I'll
enterprises the poor business

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,920
different types of clouds arm

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,150
you know I was there some statistics up
their time %uh revenues

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,959
is an vedi markedly Dr Mark it's
actually really interesting because I'm

32
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,189
you know as people moving the virtual
desktops in the cloud on their kinda

33
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,939
gone away from that BYOD policy that
they felt

34
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:26,239
introduce too much risk into their
environment so

35
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,290
with the DI environment at least they
have you know

36
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,858
workstation thats I am private IP space

37
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:36,970
you know they can centrally managed
anti-virus & patch management process

38
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,599
we're in a BYOD policy

39
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,879
doesn't really happen am I so we're
seeing more and more enterprises for

40
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,700
that reason

41
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,138
movie more more desktop work love to the
cloud um

42
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,879
just looking at some were garner saying
about 60 percent a banking institutions

43
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,569
on health care has a big push this year
I just are moving

44
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,629
I to the cloud I universities

45
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:03,200
about universities have mandates I've
talked to probably five six universities

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,409
around the country

47
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,519
and they actually have mandates where
they have to move between 1780 percent

48
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,859
their workload into the clout

49
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:13,180
I'm just put out a lower cost of
ownership

50
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,180
so cloud is becoming more and more
attractive every day for more more

51
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,430
businesses which means

52
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,400
now the traditional things we used to do
and enterprise like forensics

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,000
investigation is now moving out into the
about

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,799
ever course bad guys are going after as
well

55
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,690
I'm we do a cloud report every year so
we have about three years a data we've

56
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,459
been tracking

57
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,489
the see what type of attacks are
actually taking place I am as you can

58
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:40,739
see vulnerability scanning one for
twenty-some percent 44

59
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,680
on pretty significant jump group or some
3244

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,979
the malware botnets from five to 11
percent nodding his number still

61
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:54,250
but still 100 percent increase arm so as
we see more MORE different workloads

62
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,919
moving there

63
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,569
we're going to see a lot more this
malware bonnet iPod touch base with

64
00:03:58,569 --> 00:03:59,149
beady eye

65
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,750
is now where people open their email on
the

66
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,440
cloud instance where they arm doing
their web browsing on the cloud instance

67
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,620
so you can start seeing a little bit
more targeted attacks against that type

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,329
of environment

69
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,510
so what we've done that collect data

70
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,279
is we've deployed a IR global honey net
up honey pot servers every note on both

71
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,310
servers personal

72
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,430
also I'm in the right room so I'm

73
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,150
we arm the with the honeypot servers we
have deployed several different types

74
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,370
I kept well being my favorite I like IPL

75
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,539
arm but there's die and they are which
is a very low interaction type honey pot

76
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:41,370
are reason why like ap bio is because it
goes a little beyond just after 25 it's

77
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,219
actually starts

78
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:45,229
the logging that actors I Pete

79
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:48,479
keystrokes as his attacking you it and
even after him

80
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,359
disconnects from the server from his
attack it maintains a connection with Ms

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,150
continues the collectors keystrokes

82
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,810
so that means during your investigation
you to find out

83
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,860
email addresses maybe this guy's log
into his email address because

84
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,900
yes anyways done this at any time in
their life you know you don't just focus

85
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,460
on that one thing all night long you
have usually three four five different

86
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,770
screens go in at same time

87
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,909
so as is waiting for processes run he
really doesn't exist email

88
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:17,419
great often defiant star profiling the
guy who is it

89
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,010
what's his email address is the
associated with any type I'll

90
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,450
legitimate organization or a crew out
there I'm from the underground

91
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,779
I we found that there is a lot of
different

92
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:31,830
hits across the globe it all depends
where you're at

93
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,750
we found that Microsoft directory
services port 445

94
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,310
was the number one attack recker I we
had more

95
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,979
over 51 percent other attacks were on
port 445

96
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:47,060
everybody knows offer for four or five
its I am very men

97
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,389
having the solve networking issues with
up files back in the day

98
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,599
well for 45 is that I i rival IP
replacement for

99
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:58,070
that buyouts where you can now if you
have multiple cloud servers you to set

100
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,080
up drive shares between each other

101
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,699
so that tells you what the attackers are
looking for they're looking for file

102
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,740
data to look for intellectual property

103
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,100
on their tryna

104
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,870
use it as a jump point a lot of times so
we found that the highest the top

105
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,890
that we saw our in Europe um which

106
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,919
I really attribute a lot to log in our
writers I action year

107
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,310
so in order for some other botnets to
successfully test after test in their

108
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,330
local region because they can go over
international lines because

109
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,479
that adds a latency which might confuse
the botnet into my not I

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,870
give the proper response the actual
malicious actors are writing this

111
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,880
so they do a lot of testing in their own
backyard the we found that a lot of it

112
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,719
was hitting Northern Europe was hitting
Western Europe

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,310
Ireland the UK of France

114
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,720
Isles lot of it was originating from
like the meadowlands

115
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,650
a.m. Eastern Europe so I lot of testing
taking place as you can see

116
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,159
besides microsoft directory services you
know I databases were continually the

117
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,790
number

118
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,750
to target Aaron every single region
around the world I

119
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,990
and we have the servers deployed across
multiple service providers

120
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,760
arm in every region as I mentioned um an
interesting thing we saw was that forty

121
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,370
percent of them our that was launched
against her honeypot infrastructure

122
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,830
was not detected by anti-virus cell

123
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,349
I'm not saying anti virus is that
because it's not it has a

124
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,580
a place in the security industry at IGI
that you might implement

125
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,190
in the enterprise and in the cloud by it
doesn't catch everything

126
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,640
so im you'd be surprised I mean the
other 14 percent was all versions is

127
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,460
configure I mean things we've been seen
since about 2007

128
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,969
but these guys keep rewriting the code
at the bypass a the controls

129
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,980
and so then they have another remarkable
piece on the

130
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,120
actual on the market ready to go so

131
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,890
in order to catch these guys and run
forensics investigation after these

132
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,770
types of attacks are taking a place

133
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,760
you first really need to understand the
clout and understand

134
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,300
where you are inside a cloud environment
because there's three

135
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,640
different versions o'clock is basically
a private club

136
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,820
which is in the back and a a hosting
provider space and its

137
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,510
non route II peas and has a point to
point connection between

138
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,730
the infrastructure inside the service
provider and your enterprise environment

139
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,710
so the point point just like a VPN
tunnel going back and forth

140
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,359
then you have I'm kinda the hybrid cloud
which is

141
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,700
I maybe somebody who might have a like
credit card campaigns this lot where

142
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,240
they have a database server

143
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,900
that they'll drop in the private cloud
it and I'll have a public

144
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,289
web interface on the public cloud for
people to access the data

145
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,610
but then between there there's a point
the point I peed IP port the port

146
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,590
connection

147
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,490
I'm between the private and the public
cloud instance

148
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,040
then arm then of course there's public
about you know just going out there

149
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,020
Amazon spinning up some servers

150
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,480
and doing whatever you need to do I
anybody

151
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,170
are suffering from any satellite mean
kinda situations

152
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,180
I'll wear people within your
organization are speeding up

153
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,310
I'll servers will without you even
knowing they're doing testing have your

154
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,099
enterprise data out there without

155
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,010
it. even being involved in part of the
process arm

156
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,030
I'll take a side track right here just
talk about a few technologies that you

157
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,740
find to find that stuff in the
environment arm

158
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,280
so there's our there's actually a couple
then as I can see you here today

159
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,300
that do this as part of their process
but and easy way to do it

160
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,479
is actually through I your web
filtration products

161
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,640
or through some type of our NetFlow
collection where you collect the IP

162
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,350
addresses

163
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,960
because what you can do is you can
actually blacklists

164
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,770
those CD ends that belong to the
different hosting providers

165
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,000
words gonna send you an event arnal ur
every single time

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,110
some be within your organization goes
out to one those

167
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,120
service providers the login actually get
to their cloud server

168
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,410
so it's a great easy inexpensive way

169
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,990
for you just to find out who in your
organization is actually utilizing the

170
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,600
club because I've been in a lot of
places where you know damn group all

171
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,530
those been up there

172
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,720
environments you know use a credit card
expenses I

173
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,690
you know it. group I'm trying to wrangle
a try to manage to bring an in-house

174
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,280
make sure

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,630
what are you putting out there what's
our risk what what type date are you

176
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,890
placing out mccloud I

177
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,660
it then that's always a constant
struggle for it. so that's why I always

178
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,640
thought of an idea

179
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,780
like using the web filtration because if
they're gonna go out to the

180
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,920
consul the manage their on varmint we're
gonna head

181
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,400
IP space long-term service provider are
so it's a great way just to find out who

182
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,930
in your organization's actually

183
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:43,239
utilizing the clout so gonna stand the
cloudy gotta understand how the kinda

184
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,960
the cloud services kinda work cell there
are several different pieces of

185
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,880
architecture here you have Dom's 0 which
is basically your management

186
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,210
arm operator operator he this Dom 0
controls

187
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:02,330
all the hypervisor to hardware to CPU
just been allocated to the users which

188
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,300
are da mu

189
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,599
so we have to Linux users in a windows
box there

190
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,770
arm that's how old the hypervisor works

191
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,240
I and basic functionality because it
just

192
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,980
allocates memory hard drive space a CPU

193
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,320
to the particular instance so

194
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,240
how does house actually function now
we've seen a lot of hypervisor exports

195
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,430
this year that come out

196
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,390
that have been letting people like a
regular user will sit out here and bring

197
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,189
three

198
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,530
which is considered the application ring
that's where you as a consumer

199
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,510
have all your data and where you do all
your job now the ring 0

200
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,990
is actually where all the light the
hypervisor and Dom 0 take the control

201
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,780
that's where they allocate resources

202
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,589
arm in some natural architectures on
Intel and AMD came out with a

203
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:55,020
a ring -1 because they wanted a balanced
the resources a little bit more

204
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,199
but I'm this is pretty much tougher the

205
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,960
typical process that you're gonna run so
how do we do forensics with in that type

206
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,750
of environment

207
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,100
you know

208
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,930
and why do we do it there's a lot of
cybercrime out there non on topic just

209
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,949
the people actually getting compromise

210
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:16,189
but there's a lot of activity like
there's organized crime

211
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,300
I'm there's violations a data recovery

212
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,699
which happens intentionally or sometimes
a accidentally

213
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,979
I but some the things that we found like
right here this selling that stuff I

214
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,870
actually found that on a cloud server
where this guy was out there

215
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,670
selling credit card data I so we had to
scrape all the day the

216
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,310
get try to link it back to the banking
no institution that issue the cards

217
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,089
let them know that they had some data
leakage on because this guy was out

218
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:44,319
there selling it because

219
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:47,709
why the cloud is a great place for
malicious activity to occur

220
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,790
I early days a cloud I use the car a
cesspool love activity

221
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,069
because these guys can spin up a cloud
with a stolen credit card that they

222
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,579
bought

223
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,829
and they could be online for 90 days
before they get kicked off the network

224
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:05,540
I'm so that what happens is the first 30
days you know credit card gets charged

225
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,990
maybe the person finds it because they
watched your credit card statement every

226
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,040
month maybe they down

227
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,740
on let's assume they do so at the end
the sixth that sixty-day period comes

228
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,569
the second month

229
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:19,339
they bill and they get a response back
saying well you know all the car didn't

230
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,160
go through

231
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,180
you know you know maybe the date change
maybe something happened so they

232
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,670
actually given a grace period another 30
days

233
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,680
so that's ninety days that

234
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,979
malicious activity can be taking place
on the clock that's where you see these

235
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,819
guys there's still this credit card

236
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:39,490
spinning up cloud servers and starting
this other data through using one is

237
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,990
stolen credit cards that they are

238
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,250
took so and of course we get lotsa
interesting up

239
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,690
credit card data user names passwords
island of course you're

240
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,390
regular 4chan type a stuffed with the
celebrity you

241
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,080
photos and things like that low were
some the challenges you know it's really

242
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,480
the

243
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,200
you know the you really need to
understand the provider arm

244
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,650
and that's the tough part because every
providers different each

245
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,069
provider offers different services but
they're all the same in the corner

246
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,940
because when we have to run forensic
investigation it really becomes a

247
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,360
partnership between

248
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,520
investigator the client and the service
provider

249
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,680
without all three of them it's not going
to work because

250
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,609
as an investigator you're not allowed in
the data center floor

251
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,920
they won't let you they don't care who
you are I'm I've seen them actually I

252
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,839
walked fed

253
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,280
offer the floor after some me
accidentally let 'em on because

254
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,439
it goes against the contracts that they
have with their customers

255
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,130
um now that doesn't happen all data
center so i can assume

256
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,050
but um how do you you know how do you
find

257
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,770
the specific instance without you being
able to physically go to it touch it

258
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,270
pull the hard drive image it I'm that's
the way we've always done that

259
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,990
so there's a couple techniques so you
can go ahead and do this

260
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,390
arm but it's really really tough because

261
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,370
now the data gets tainted because you
can't just go in there and get it today

262
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,090
that your contractor to go out and do
the investigation

263
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,540
you have to submit a ticket and has to
come from the customer and the customer

264
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,699
has to grant you access the interact
with the service provider

265
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,980
it and then you submit a ticket then the
ticket gets routed to some server

266
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,800
ministry

267
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,740
straighter that just goes and makes copy
of an image not thinking does this have

268
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,150
to be forensically sound

269
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,319
I'm just copying this image and I'm
putting on the

270
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,070
drive and I'm giving it back to the
client service rep was then going to

271
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,510
contact the customer and say we have
your drive ready

272
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,730
how do you wanna join us ship it to you
on come

273
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,280
get it on to me depending on location so
it becomes a

274
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,390
a real nightmare because by the time you
actually get the drive

275
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,840
run the investigation days a very gone
by

276
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,329
and

277
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,829
you don't have you know the up-to-date
data I mean

278
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,579
everything's been tainted the server
administrator when he made changes and

279
00:15:58,579 --> 00:15:59,699
copy the files

280
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,258
modified all the dates so there goes
that out the window

281
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:06,660
I so what do you do it becomes very very

282
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,449
hard the work through a service provider
arm

283
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:13,748
some more charges you know obtaining
assistance from the infrastructure

284
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:17,309
you know the provider staff like I
mentioned it's a process yet the smut

285
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,170
some editing

286
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,618
it's not like you just pick up the phone
call and some of these things once they

287
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:23,209
get their legal department involved

288
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:27,689
arm and then it goes beyond just days
then it gets in the weeks because then

289
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:30,368
they got a review the paperwork they
gotta make sure what you're doing is in

290
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,059
grabbing other people's data and

291
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,699
on that same are instance on the
topology

292
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:40,209
our policies stores you know how does
that happen the clout where's the data

293
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,439
you know is that in their data center
chicago is a

294
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:47,099
the in the East Coast the west coast is
that oversees

295
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,999
I we find out a lot overseas where
people in the UK are very concerned

296
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,610
about their data here in the US

297
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,689
because they're afraid that you know
because it's

298
00:16:55,689 --> 00:17:00,469
residing here then a and the US that the
NSA has access to them copy whatever

299
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,689
they want so they won all their data
sitting

300
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,888
and their country over there and the UK
very interesting

301
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:10,918
very interesting process I and if you've
ever tried to get data from overseas

302
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,949
its hurts hey we're talking about you
think a certain

303
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,589
writer process is long I'm weaver I'm
talk to some law enforcement folks about

304
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,938
how you just get warns overseas it
sometimes can take

305
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,939
from the time a judge actually signed
into the time to get in front of a judge

306
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:25,980
in another country

307
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,139
it could be as well as excessive 10
years

308
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:33,549
so I'm good luck on your friends
investigation you know that they're all

309
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:34,110
still

310
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,219
arm that inability to like I said to
respond in timely fashion cousin

311
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,870
does a critical when there's an answer
that you got to get in there when

312
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,100
there's a breach you got together

313
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,350
as quickly as possible so that you can
find all the pieces of the puzzle the

314
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,260
make your investigation sound and by
having a delay it makes it incredibly

315
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,059
difficult

316
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,820
the database infrastructure now you
tumble shared environments

317
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,178
you know it's not just you clone this
database server but that database server

318
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:05,140
may have a hundred other tenants on it
so

319
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,120
from that means that that's going to be
a process to describing what we long

320
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,360
septic lower customer

321
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,549
I'm the chain a custy peace but we talk
about

322
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:17,400
how do you maintain trim castle when you
submit a get the ticket does the server

323
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,549
am a server admin

324
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,559
maybe he starts the job it in the mid
the neck shift come in

325
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,899
that I finishes the job close out the
ticket centre drive back to some

326
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,429
customer service guy who then contact
you

327
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:33,679
then put it in the mail or however you
wanna get it Jenna cuz he just became a

328
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,330
nightmare

329
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,480
I'll who owns the data yeah that's the
big thing because

330
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,650
there's privacy thats entitled to the
other tenants that are on that box

331
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,710
arm and there is a I'm

332
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,860
organ stated where they talk about
regardless where data resides

333
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,360
the person the individual has the right
to privacy

334
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,850
so that means they just cant go clone a
whole server because then you this

335
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,149
violated their privacy

336
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,860
are you not only by later SLAs from the
company by you might have

337
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,709
violated some laws in the process cell
here's my soul chart I found that missed

338
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,440
out there

339
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,559
and they basically the highlighted
although and green

340
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,860
credible on the challenges that are
happening

341
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,110
you know the juror station challenges we
didn't even get into the legal issues

342
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,580
%uh this

343
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,039
arm because different states have
different laws you know

344
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:26,120
verdad data reporting breaches it all
depends on what state you're in

345
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,830
different in every state and it's not
based on where the data resides

346
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,990
it so the data that was leaked where did
those people reside

347
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,929
those are no obligation that's why
you're seeing with the I was the one

348
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,040
that has happened in the

349
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,940
I which case you're seeing you know
Attorney General's from California

350
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,890
Florida in all these other states

351
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,960
coming in and making a big deal about it
and coming over investigating checks

352
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,640
while

353
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,760
that's an election year they need to
make a buzz make people feel like they

354
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,450
care

355
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,530
you know they're looking out for their
best interests I'll

356
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,600
just my opinion on that one but arm

357
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,959
so is its its incredibly challenging
from not only a legal perspective

358
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,840
but from a national investigation
perspective and where

359
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,500
what's there are no and where the
breakdown happens where we go from

360
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,970
traditional forensics

361
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,570
to kind of network forensics is really
right there

362
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,790
at arm right at this point

363
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:28,139
right here in the middle because you
still do the them occasionally evidence

364
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,280
that the answer there

365
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,330
on but then something else has to do
some question because you gotta tell

366
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,449
them what to do that given the basis and
they have to go to the question

367
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,390
and then once you get the day you get to
organize examine it analyze it

368
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,480
and then you put together your
presentation at the end so again and

369
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,400
this aspect

370
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,420
seizing servers isn't an option you
can't walk in and just sees a server

371
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,760
arm the evidence based on the providers
were you gotta take

372
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,680
that what they do said in that ticket
they did you know and that they followed

373
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,110
some type a process

374
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,270
I'm internal process for cloning these
type of data

375
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,070
arm and that your as an investigator
you're very dependent on the cloud

376
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,720
provider

377
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,970
and they can hold up your investigation
I'm by

378
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,480
days and weeks because I have their own
internal processes

379
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,170
what happens if the guy copies the day
that comes back in the security team

380
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,460
says well this isn't sound a you died
over do it again well

381
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,560
the results already tainted now so what
happens

382
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,780
in-the-know locations as we mentioned
earlier

383
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,580
so you gotta really start thinking about
network forensics are you know try I'm

384
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,419
because traditional French digital
forensics is not gonna work within this

385
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,040
environment

386
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,879
arm and there's many many cases that are
happening over and

387
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,420
over and over and the clout I by what we
have

388
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,150
as investigators are wrong on our the
capital I'll capture packets RP caps

389
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:53,240
I log data cloning servers on and tell
you a couple stories about that process

390
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,640
are looking for a few words and parsed
data you know reviewing any type of idea

391
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,230
for last logs are out there

392
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,420
and hope that they have these logs arm

393
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,820
and hope that they even have some
technology out there that that

394
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,570
you can rely on the bill grab sound logs
from because not everybody does

395
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,260
I mean there's a there's so many cloud
instances i've seen out there

396
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,920
that a person's us roll out some IP
tables in Abyan they're like hey I'm

397
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,410
good

398
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:23,410
um I'm I do work fifteen years ago
twenty years ago but doesn't work today

399
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,370
arm soul having these technologies is
the first step

400
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,120
you have to understand that these
technologies are implemented

401
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,360
and how do I get the log date of it as
quickly as possible

402
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,199
and hopefully they have an archive
process and understanding the service

403
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,530
providers very key

404
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,200
because the service provider on if you
think they're going to supply you with

405
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,230
networking logs firewall logs

406
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,280
arm forget about it's not going to
happen so

407
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,340
that's why I drew this upward this is
where the service providers

408
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,429
wind stops and your responsibility as
consumer begins

409
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,560
so as you can see the server computing
power you'll

410
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,230
logical network segmentation the hard
hypervisors they give you access that

411
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,860
kinda stuff

412
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,939
that's where they draw a line that's all
they do

413
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,570
from now everything and those dark areas
appear

414
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,120
as far as our application is one-half
per se irresponsibility

415
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,189
are you have %uh some response where the
host level for Access Manager and patch

416
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,880
management

417
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,550
at the network layer for network threat
detection an analysis of all this data

418
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,810
is incredibly p but not all consumers
actually understand that

419
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,320
so when you gonna run investigation you
might be dealing with an uninformed

420
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,610
from small business that just made a lot
of something that this cloud provider

421
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,498
did a lot more than what he actually
thought they

422
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:48,700
and that happens all the time I mean
when I was working as a service provider

423
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,799
II got store I got things like are

424
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:55,979
people arm there's one instance was a
new york financial company

425
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:59,989
and they have fired their system
administrator on Friday

426
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:03,450
and so they could they are went through

427
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,999
the leaders held out his eighty
credentials lock them out their network

428
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:08,149
lock now the building

429
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:12,039
but they forgot to hit the club so

430
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:15,658
about 3 a.m. after guys probably been
drinking all night

431
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:20,460
he goes out and he actually takes their
whole infrastructure down on the clock

432
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,019
and met those people called up test
they're alive man are the structure down

433
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,109
our sites downward the processing no
business right now

434
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:31,379
what happened arm their light world

435
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:34,439
will they thought it was our
responsibility but guess what they

436
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,210
didn't remove his access rights

437
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,509
so the login with valid credentials

438
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:44,489
so understanding how bargains are taking
place in the cloud allows you to log

439
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:45,269
into because

440
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:49,599
some people are integrating their cloud
infrastructure where their actual out

441
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,418
Active Directory in their enterprise and
sinking that across the board so that

442
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:54,269
they can have

443
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:58,139
one central location the Lee all user
access across

444
00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:01,478
everything cloud and enterprise so um

445
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:05,549
understanding that is is definitely key
arm for your investigation because you

446
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:06,408
have to understand

447
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:10,460
where this line is because any laws
that's it in this space

448
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,789
you don't have access to you're not
going to get his party your

449
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:14,649
investigation

450
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:18,189
this is all you get access to this party
your investigation

451
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,190
so that's what we have to rely on the
bill the

452
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,759
put the pieces together to put a case
together the bill the present are mine

453
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,219
Ebeling loss solutions

454
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:30,729
you know that's that's a share
responsibility arm

455
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,479
one other things I'm gonna make a
shameless plug for Amazon just because I

456
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,749
thought they came out awesome

457
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:40,349
very very cool technology this year but
they came out cloud trail which

458
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:44,609
they're the first ones to come out with
the capability %uh view now logging the

459
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:48,039
back end so we always talk about logging
the front and other than stand so that

460
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:48,639
we know

461
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:51,928
were who from the internet is actually
hitting our environment

462
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:56,489
but with clout rail now you couldn't log
the back end so any API calls

463
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,960
coming from the hypervisor on any call
any updates that they're doing to your

464
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,690
environment

465
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,309
you know things like that you'll be all
the now law that type data that so I

466
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:07,479
thought that was a very very cool
innovative

467
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:10,879
I've service that they came out with an
they've been expanding it to now their

468
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:12,248
database services

469
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:15,239
and a bunch over different
infrastructure so i think is very very

470
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:15,919
cool

471
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,210
because I can tell you I mean I used to
have to run a lot a cloud investigations

472
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,109
I at the service provider I work that
and while I was there

473
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:27,309
you know yeah I'll ninety-eight percent
I'll

474
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:32,229
the our servers that I touched were
actually I legitimately bad guys doing

475
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:33,139
bad stuff

476
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:36,908
but there was that two percent that I
touch that I have when examined data

477
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:37,379
because

478
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:40,859
I had a report from a third party that I
need to go investigate which were

479
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:42,249
legitimate customers

480
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:45,479
I that we're just doing regular business
and nothing was wrong with their

481
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,070
environment

482
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,470
was a false alarm I so the bill to know
that that's taking place

483
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,389
that's what clout ray allows you to do
on which is very very cool

484
00:26:55,389 --> 00:27:00,238
I'm a billion the the perform some time
with Deepak a forensics you know that's

485
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:03,609
that's kinda my pipe dream right now we
don't have that today

486
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:08,080
I've been talking to somebody pack a
forensic vendors out there like a

487
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,210
NetWitness and Slayer about you know we
need to really get into the environment

488
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,789
where we can start collecting

489
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:17,700
Deepak forensics and if you don't know
t-back forensic is it's like that TiVo

490
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,589
for your network

491
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:22,799
I was recommended for people who run
incident response inside a enterprise

492
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,849
organization

493
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:28,079
are because it is TiVo it records
everything going in and out here now

494
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,658
works of something happens

495
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:34,079
you can go back every player traffic
writing email that person click on

496
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,979
you know what link that they go to the
infected actually pull the P cap in pool

497
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:40,639
file that they got infected with

498
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:44,408
in reverse engineer without having to go
to all the different dust off the touch

499
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:44,659
'em

500
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:49,079
great tool to help but I like to see
gonna clout RDS time

501
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,299
design for the cloud that's a tricky one
because it's a different type

502
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:55,450
you know it's not the hardware ID s IPS
you got to have

503
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,990
the ages um up the NetFlow collection
that's actually something I'm

504
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,500
were very very close to not us as our by
the

505
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,019
some vendors out there in the in the
industry that do NetFlow

506
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:11,070
as far as collecting NetFlow data for
ARM from cloud instances

507
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,110
not always consider that kinda a poor
mans the packet forensic analyze

508
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,340
on because you can deploy enough low a
lot faster and you put a blacklist

509
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:19,980
against it

510
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,730
see traffic that might be leaving a
printer going off to our

511
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,029
country overseas we've seen a lot of
that through now flow I mean just weird

512
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,669
anomalies you'll find your network

513
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:33,799
so I think arm net flows a great step
for them to be able to get the the

514
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,120
packet friends again allies

515
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,500
are there's a lot of occasions out there
for memory analysis that a lot of our

516
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,230
I researchers are put out there but on
that really I'm

517
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,950
it's basically what you're comfortable
with what you're used to using

518
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,110
are multi 10 sealer I'll

519
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,240
as a lazy very important because that
you gotta understand

520
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,690
watcher SLAs because you have to I'm
know where the boundaries are

521
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,860
that you run your investigation because
if you go any further than that

522
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,049
you not only to ensure evidence for you
now just affected the privacy of other

523
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,399
people that could be potentially on
their boss

524
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,899
soul on a run through a process that I
did when we found some data

525
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:18,129
I'm a while back so we we're dealing
with

526
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,159
a customer who sold antique backwards

527
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,820
I real cool guy I has some really cool
tubs in the old antique sinks and all

528
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,620
that kind of stuff

529
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:33,529
and we found some unusual activity just
occurring on is incident so we got up

530
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:36,889
a friend of mine I am from a company
that will be unnamed

531
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:40,389
on contact me cuz he is a fellow
researcher out in the industry

532
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:45,199
and he contact us say hey man I'm seeing
some date outta my organizational even

533
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,769
its going out into your

534
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:50,679
into your IP space can you go take a
look at it for me sure

535
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,269
although take a look are so I'll to the

536
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:57,580
to us researcher guys went out there
took a look at the guy server

537
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,399
everything look pretty normal well
you're like what what's what's this

538
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,110
check is bad

539
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,139
with unseal you know what what what's
going on the server

540
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,360
I was very very steady but then once
every two weeks you see huge spike

541
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,809
huge spike every couple weeks and we're
like me that's kind of interesting

542
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:17,610
so we contacted the actual user at that
point and said hey

543
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:22,840
you know we want to move you an upgrade
you to our brand new server into this

544
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,720
environment

545
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,440
but we'd really like to keep this one in
tact is there some unusual activity

546
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,820
that's occurring on the server

547
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,178
so of course is he gonna deny being
upgraded

548
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:35,600
for no additional cost to a new server
jumped all over it

549
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,809
so that's all we did was move is always
there to a new server redirected DNS

550
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:44,080
so then we started loading on some tools
on this with star loading on things like

551
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,770
Wireshark network minor on the actual
box itself and we started on

552
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,720
running a tapping running all his data
through a forensic analyzer

553
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,480
and then we waited for the next attack
two weeks later what happens

554
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,480
unallocated IP space in the IP address
so this guy space

555
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,220
gets activated gets loaded as a remote
access server

556
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,400
it and also you see gigabytes of data
floating into the server

557
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,510
floating out another server in South
Korea I am and where I was coming from

558
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,179
we saw alarm

559
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:20,600
I will mentioning vendors but we saw
interesting things in this data stream

560
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,100
like

561
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,678
I blueprints for test I aircraft

562
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:30,290
arm helicopters on summer polls summary
propulsion dries

563
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:34,090
REO bunch of interesting did and we're
like on this is kinda interesting why's

564
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,270
it on the south korea

565
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,010
there are friends arm yeah

566
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,690
so I'll happens to be that in the stream
that we were collecting have the

567
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,880
username and password for the other
server

568
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,150
so we kinda went in just took a look at
the other server to see what I was doing

569
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,620
and we found out from there it then was
dumping all the data down in the Beijing

570
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,139
China

571
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,740
but what was really successful for us is
that

572
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,080
if we would have to do post forensics on
something like that would be nearly

573
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,260
impossible

574
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,350
because love the way the guy was on
there he did modify it the user's data

575
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,050
at all i mean this guy processes credit
cards

576
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,820
army has developers user names passwords
as all these things he coulda done

577
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,700
by stealing the actual customers data
then touch

578
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,750
was announced that he just wanted to use
that server as a jump point

579
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:28,270
so by having the capability %uh loading
these types the tools

580
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,520
and running the forensic investigation
live

581
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,030
as is actually taking place is the best
key because if you can get those initial

582
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:41,190
are indicators of compromise that allows
you to get in front of the attack

583
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,809
let's start loading up the tools on the
box that you can use like network minor

584
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:48,178
and I'll Wireshark or whatever

585
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,100
version a pick-up election you want to
use on and go out there and start

586
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,480
collecting the day live

587
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,140
if you have access to Deepak a friends
again elisa that's even better because

588
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,910
then you can on their virtual instances
they could just pop out there and just

589
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,010
run atop of Irvine star running it
through there then you can

590
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:08,780
helps your investigation even more by if
we were having the coming to this post

591
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,379
it would never been this successful we
would never saw the top

592
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,520
we would never been able to track back
to the actual organs that

593
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,110
that there was going to and how they are
attacking the all the different

594
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,559
organizations that were affected so

595
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:26,160
running this paper process in my pin is
probably one of the best ways to do

596
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,510
forensics in the clock because
traditional forensics is not going to

597
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:29,840
work

598
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,470
the way it used I mean so we really have
to rely on network forensics

599
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,909
which means we need to make sure that
our the customers that were servicing

600
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:40,150
are logging everything and their lawyer
properly

601
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:44,840
and that their long year for sufficient
amount of time because logging is not

602
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,340
cheap

603
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,449
I am i mean I that's just the way it is

604
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:53,100
but if you think about it are based on
demand a report this year the average

605
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,459
time than a breach

606
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,440
that an attacker is on a network 229
days

607
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,150
so you'd know that you need to have at
least that long the

608
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,750
log data the bill to go back to the
investigation to find out what happened

609
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,850
in the beginning

610
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:11,259
arm very very key now arm

611
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,200
any questions I never saw questions
comments concerns

612
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,168
alright you're saving offer them right
very cool so all

613
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:22,888
there's there some does anybody remember
helix

614
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,899
anybody remember helix the good ol
forensics tool that

615
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:31,109
they kinda I'll went over helix Pro for
kinda let the free version kinda

616
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:34,859
fall by the wayside I am well um

617
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,819
Andy Bennett which is going to talking
later today and his crew over Sam

618
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,429
Houston

619
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:43,389
on actually revived the project I'm so

620
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:47,109
for those that do forensic investigation
they came out with psychics

621
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:51,049
which is basically some the equivalent
away

622
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,389
feel it used to be has the combination
have all the tools that comes on it

623
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,250
comes in with a

624
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,770
Isles bootable CD that you can load up
in launch and do forensics investigation

625
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,130
with it has some other tools on there
that you can use also in the cloud

626
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,000
investigation

627
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,930
all but I'll just I love to give him a
plug on this because

628
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,859
arm I was very frustrated I mean as many
investigators were anybody who use even

629
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,090
playing in that space

630
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,630
that when he let's start a really gone
by the wayside probably be

631
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,040
what ten years ago eight years ago
something like that where

632
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,170
you know they stop supporting the the
free version other because they're

633
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,210
trying to go pro

634
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,540
I'll get there by the byproduct come the
competitor FTK and

635
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:36,310
in-case arm that I think I let it fall
by the wayside which was really sad

636
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,470
because it was a great open source tool
and

637
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,950
I mean I use the a time during my
investigation days

638
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,439
so having this tool right here from I

639
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,410
that abandon his team did great great
tool to use

640
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,200
so without all thank you for your time

641
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,460
I appreciate it I remember you know when
you're working investigation

642
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,400
you gotta remember three things your
running a network forensic investigation

643
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,720
not a traditional investigation so you
have to rely on log data you need to

644
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,569
rely on

645
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:12,320
security technologies are deployed being
able to collect logs from the security

646
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,170
technologies

647
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,500
you have to understand the relationship
with the service provider that your

648
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,280
customer now

649
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,720
as you have to understand how the server
service provider functions and how they

650
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,410
work

651
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,250
arm then if you find out you do
something

652
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,770
you know if they're coming to you
because there's a Lifehacker you have a

653
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,710
very good decision there to make because

654
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,020
then you can work with the service
provider have the server

655
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,430
service provider actually upgrade them
to a new steer

656
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,759
and leave that I'm original box live
because then you could do the forensic

657
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,570
investigation

658
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,580
live as the actual attacks are
continuing to take place

659
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,270
which is key because the IP address
doesn't change and that's what the

660
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,360
attackers using

661
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,280
so it's a partnership between yourself
as the investigator

662
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,940
the consumer the service provider and
the service provider themself

663
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,520
combination of the three is what's going
to help you have this is a

664
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,680
successful investigation so without I'll
take

665
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,910
any questions even outside forensics

666
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:16,910
Guam yessir

667
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,680
um very good question I'm I haven't seen
it all the way through the legal

668
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,649
proceeding process because what happened
when we

669
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,910
ran probably about three or four these
um

670
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,140
because a the sensitivity of the data

671
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,420
I'm usually law enforcement came over
took over the investigation ran with it

672
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,600
from that point forward

673
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,940
but they were extremely grateful that we
have been collecting data for the last

674
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,270
two months before they got there

675
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,970
um so but um we kept the dais they said

676
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,149
according to the a the fed's showed up

677
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:59,410
the data was sound the way we provide a
more solid we're giving OnLive captures

678
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,060
a factual data versus actually cloning
the dry we were given them

679
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,170
to live live data so they accepted it

680
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:13,170
so i SEM if they accepted it also it
would make the next year

681
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:28,160
oh yeah

682
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:35,440
yeah it's

683
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,500
all

684
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,030
all right thing min

685
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,030
oh yeah absolutely all

686
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,140
DUP that's very typical

687
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,480
I'm were a lot of people who are running
cloud instances are logging

688
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,220
their solutions their security solutions
and their server did

689
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,370
to an instance sitting you know either
in the cloud somewhere else

690
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:03,069
or to their enterprise or sometimes also
to like man security providers I've seen

691
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,600
all those three different tiers

692
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,890
than the environment but you're right I
mean what you get a service provider you

693
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,520
try to walk into a data center it's not
going to happen man

694
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,500
its it's just does not happen and
violates all the rules on their

695
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,170
confidentiality agreements with all the
customers

696
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:24,320
so I'm I mean I've seen action guys get
fired for walking people out on the days

697
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,040
on the floor

698
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,740
so it became a big no no I mean a
c-level executives I

699
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,759
who was walking a giving a toward people

700
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,950
he got fired and that or got terminated
Amelia's is they discover that their

701
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,580
people

702
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,650
that were not employ sundays are for and
they got rid this

703
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:44,850
the c-level executive just for that very
reason so yeah it's it's very tricky

704
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,589
situation that's why I say it's a true
partnership because

705
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,450
you're kinda relying on that service
provider that they gave you the right

706
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,100
data

707
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,049
I and there's a lot of what ifs involved
so that's why I'm a big believer I'm

708
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,950
the breach is going on right now let's
get 'em upgrade it was still alive right

709
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,049
now because then I don't have to rely on
that server administrator to

710
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,790
you know clone har clone instance I
don't have to rely on him the

711
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,880
give it to the customer service you
bypass the whole process

712
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:16,880
and actually collect the data live as
it's taken place

713
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:25,450
that

714
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,310
yep failed

715
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,210
check mark yes

716
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:36,210
yes ma'am

717
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,538
I have not I have not anywhere else

718
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:46,770
oca I will hand the back

719
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,550
thank you very much

720
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:49,800
its
