1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,330
its eric has a CISSP too so he's legit

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,480
what's forever but know that going
certified check tomorrow

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,200
from a few heights out thanks

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,470
can you hear me all right on pre-lab
alright so thanks I write for common

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,580
I more and talk about today is some
advance fishing tactics

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,049
basically I'm we want to talk about why
I what we do on penetration test when we

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,970
do a fish

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,319
why it works and I Y user awareness

9
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:36,870
some doesn't really work and should
probably at the bottom of your list of

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,888
priorities

11
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:43,489
anyway so

12
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,870
I basically is wrong on talk about arm

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,209
sort of an overview i wanna talk about
what

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,120
what is spearfishing that's one of those
things where there's a ton a different

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,708
definition out there on the internet

16
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:57,999
and just depending on where you look
found

17
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:01,749
is depending on the definition you get
and now wanna talk about how we do our

18
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:02,819
spearfishing

19
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,650
and we want to talk about ways to
mitigate it of course

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,870
and down why some in the car and stuff
isn't working

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,860
so

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,720
some as I gotta skip this sensor Sam
re-introduced us but

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,700
there's my great introduction side
aerCap 0.5% drop

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,160
so to singer Coffey and get a fight so

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,390
first thing I like to do is define what
i'm talking about. so I want talk about

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,340
what is spearfishing really self

27
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,720
everybody knows what a phishing email is
right yes

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,420
you in this room is the heir to the
Prince of Nigeria currently

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,800
and quite a few meet you

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,100
they're only cost me $10 G's Tom so

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,429
basically spearfishing is a targeted
attack I am

32
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,940
I J here's the definition that I like
the vast

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,320
on obviously it's not set in stone but

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,130
on this is the definition that I like
because it's a targeted attack and

35
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,869
somebody that's targeting a person a
company a business unit

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,180
something specific

37
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,099
and they go out and they do their
research that means not sending an email

38
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,119
that says

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,439
hey you're near the prince in Nigeria
that mean sending an email that make

40
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,219
sense to the business and the language
of the business that

41
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:29,219
you know that looks legit C

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,280
cells

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,420
other system

44
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,359
I X O for talk about some crime victims
a spear phishing attacks

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,750
see by ever to the white house

46
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,489
cell that was asked by the way hey so
apparently they

47
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,470
they were the victims atmosphere
phishing attack nom unfortunately

48
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,810
you never know what really happened but
anyway so these are some other big

49
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,500
companies

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,360
that are victims a spear phishing
attacks and I'm not to harp on all these

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,190
and go over

52
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,670
a over everything but the thing is the
reason to put this up is that

53
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,280
um that and as far as I'm concerned the
number one attack right now

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,950
externally on the internet is
spearfishing I'm you know the past

55
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,129
couple years it's been web applications
before that it was insecure services but

56
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:12,849
now we got

57
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,970
you know firewalls and have fives and

58
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,260
all kinds of things with blinking lights
and we got our perimeter secure

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,380
really really good and so I says
attackers

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,569
om why would I waste my time going
through all those defenses when I can

61
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,280
just send an email to the organization
and I

62
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,760
unfortunately face on some in the spear
phishing

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,018
aksam this is still working internet
working really well

64
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:43,030
so why did he spare phishing attacks
against their self

65
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,350
right I Sunzu know your enemy No
yourself

66
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,400
and if anybody can sell me I'll

67
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,950
a song associated with that and the band
who sings it all by an actor singer

68
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,500
teacher

69
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,250
up but basically you know what do you
bring him back

70
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,859
cancer cell phone number one we as an
organization we need to know where we

71
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:03,660
stand right what's going on

72
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,200
a we need to make sure that the money
that we're spending is being spent in

73
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,060
the right place

74
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,230
not just like he lives we're talking
about is that was fun for talking about

75
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,420
people that are actually implementing
that

76
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,200
I and that the people who are reporting
and

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,829
that making sure that everybody is on
the same page and

78
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,990
basically if you know where your
weaknesses are course you can

79
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,090
hope to strengthen them

80
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,570
I itself very nice guy has some
statistics and sell

81
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,810
these particular statistics come from
Proofpoint

82
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,790
did a survey at the last big Microsoft
com conference in a survey

83
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,220
I'm 350 I think very very large you know
organizations and

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,570
here some other statistics that came
outta that basically

85
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,540
have all the organizations that
responded believe that in the past year

86
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,200
the organization was targeted by

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,690
shemale specifically designed to
compromise their users

88
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,810
so that doesn't mean just some random
fish that gets caught by your spam

89
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,810
filter that means a targeted email that
was designed to get around spam filters

90
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,350
um basically you know

91
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,940
among organizations with a thousand or
more e-mail users but more than half the

92
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,460
respondents 56 percent believe that
organizations were targeted this is

93
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,950
because the larger your organization the
more he emails you have out there on the

94
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,010
internet working right to show you a
couple ways the data mining emails on

95
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,270
the Internet that are very very simple
and brief

96
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,390
and any idiot can do it and what happens
is that

97
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,860
the large your organization is the more
Facebook post she made her the more

98
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,570
whatever you do the more emails are out
there on the internet no more emails

99
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,099
that are out there the larger your
attack surfaces

100
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,870
and then it also said that more than
one-third of the respondents reported

101
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,130
experiencing a phishing attack in the
past year that they believe

102
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,219
resulted in a compromise so that's you
know one-third

103
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,750
a the fifty-one percent of people that
that

104
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,010
knew they were the victims I'm a
phishing email attack probably got

105
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,740
compromise

106
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,990
that doesn't mean yeah that's not even
taking into account the other 20 percent

107
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,440
don't even know they are finished C

108
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,690
this about this is me anyways I totally
stole this live from another guys talk

109
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,560
but it was awesome

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,550
um this is basically I'm how how the
attack happens

111
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,070
I'm and this is fairly everybody kinda
knows this but this picture just kinda

112
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,810
sums it up

113
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,320
I basically you research and pinpoint
the targets the main part about of spear

114
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,090
phishing attack as the research you know
the actual attack is not that big a deal

115
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,760
amidst the research and how good a
research can you on the people how much

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,300
information as your business am out
there on the internet

117
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,130
how many I'll give you a perfect example
hours researching a business the other

118
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,900
day I was to an external pen test and I
found a bunch of posts that

119
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,169
you know one at their engineers had made
on the Cisco forms

120
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,510
telling me you know he was asking
questions about

121
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,840
about modifying a Cisco ASA firewall any
posted that can pay

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,960
I mean he said I got the Cisco ASA
firewall I can get it to do this or

123
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,000
whatever and they're

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,640
do is communicate that way and then he
used his business he email address

125
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,690
and posted that can fake you know seh
like I mean

126
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,950
people are making it easy come so
basically we deliver the email

127
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,789
obviously there's some type of malware
there'll be some type of information

128
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,080
that we're after

129
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,710
on we're going to gather that
information and send it back out to

130
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,390
ourselves

131
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,840
so gathered email addresses are targets
as always usually the first app like

132
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,130
martin say invested in research using
without their and yes you can Spearfish

133
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,330
one person an organization one person is

134
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,690
also considered as occurs in very you
don't have to do everybody but

135
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,610
I what we do is a course the more
numbers that we have two more likely

136
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,280
%uh the more probable someone's going to
click on the link I

137
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,250
so basically you want to gather your
email address for the target

138
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,290
these are some little W you know who
knows %uh harvesters pretty good

139
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,900
I we have custom scripts LinkedIn is
always a good place because

140
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,260
I there's so much information you can
get from the job posts there on

141
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,750
Wednesday

142
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,160
right because then you're gonna know
what they're running in a

143
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,400
you know what systems they have maybe
one day be they have in place and all

144
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,120
these different things to help us fill

145
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,970
a a perfect targeted attack with type a
lot we're going to use if they're

146
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,279
talking about web proxies and things
like that yeah

147
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,280
you know we might use a a diversified a

148
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,859
payload as far as egress filtering

149
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,880
egress busting I'm so what are the main
things to do that if you feel that less

150
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,189
you want to go to remove everybody is
now do you don't want to

151
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,320
raise a red flag raised so one other
thing that we do is want to be harvested

152
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,220
we go through and we look and say okay
this person has the word security in

153
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,550
their

154
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:46,589
in their side also for we're gonna
remove that person for this one director

155
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,839
or there's definitely time for the
customers like you can target these

156
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,070
people right which is always

157
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,630
sea level people that are gonna click on
our way in give us full access to the

158
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,350
network I'm so there's always have to be
remain

159
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,519
I'm the fast solo all

160
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm biased so the best or as the one
bottom which is

161
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,569
jigsaw a one of the guys on our team

162
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,470
I rotor every be scrapped its in
backtrack it on github

163
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,709
culture saw where basically who knows a
check size by the way

164
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:18,359
the website takes off games are
basically what you saw is it the website

165
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,790
for sharing business from

166
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,130
cossacks got to this point I was going
to go on

167
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,380
so basically you have this website where

168
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,510
if I mean you and you give me your
business card I just posted right up

169
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,079
there

170
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,870
on that side so their API is broken
their web sites broke the only supposed

171
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,899
to be able to

172
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,300
pay for the services and get a certain
about contacts back

173
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,609
by so basically Royce

174
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,209
on our team wrote the script I'll just
go out and a polo everything on tag down

175
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:47,739
for you

176
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,820
but to deny CSV for you I I guess the
titles were there

177
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,769
bad you know so you can target a
specific geographic location even up

178
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:00,709
so I so were using humana

179
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:05,310
but yeah or work more picking on him and
as anybody works am really sorry

180
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,930
I'm we just picked them out about on cuz
it's a big corporation

181
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,279
and we didn't do anything to you man how
we can send many emails we didn't this

182
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,110
is all

183
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,329
all completely passive we just they just
got

184
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:21,029
unlucky when we were choosing our target
for the stock um

185
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,029
you already this year so I basically
what we're looking at here is that

186
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,839
Martin justice care for him as a check
for Humanity you can see it here

187
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,310
I and then it brings up the ID's over
here and then basically you can just do

188
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,760
you

189
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,740
I'm I'm

190
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,839
put in the ID number and we're going to
pick the one of course with the most

191
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,839
a people were so

192
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,269
so what he's doing years basically it
shows us all the different human as the

193
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,009
jigsaw has a course we're going to use
the one was you know

194
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,139
1800 employees and so

195
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:07,750
once we run this script it'll make a
really nice CSV file there's gonna show

196
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,139
you

197
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:15,069
for a bomb out on us 0 did you delete
another CSP

198
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:18,300
oh you didn't give bombing 0

199
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,180
yeah I did you know i'd like that's
right sorry about that

200
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,579
so as my stuff like this report so
here's a

201
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,560
I we searched all these and these are
the three different domains that came up

202
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,529
to this building

203
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,579
emails for you and that you know I L E S
is something to say we won is you may

204
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:36,370
not come cuz that's probably the

205
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:43,370
daily said they have set up for the
email and then once this is created

206
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:48,029
it's basically creating a tab separated
a CSV file

207
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,089
and awful it up and I can show you a
quick exactly what we're talking about

208
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:53,329
as far as how it shows

209
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,329
who's there where they're at what the
title is

210
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,430
this text thing that does take a little
bit because it's a

211
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,719
a large amount but you can do this for
any organization

212
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,399
I haven't had one hasn't shown up
getting enough you have you have

213
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,459
okay so now we're basically created that

214
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:18,459
file guy and open it up here

215
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,260
so here's our list go ahead and

216
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,760
for that and so you can see here we've
got

217
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,380
you know the name in the purse and it
parses all this for a year

218
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,250
to try to keep it clean what department
there and and like I said we'll go

219
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,200
through here and we'll take it. and and
I asked for the most part most

220
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,440
successful tells us they want
specifically in there

221
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,590
and then you can see here the different
cities and also the email is is that I

222
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,700
created it does

223
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,700
first initial last name which is usually
the common standard it also does

224
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,560
am first name last name but there are
definitely sites like

225
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,800
and I think Google you get to choose
whatever you are but the cool thing is

226
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,709
is usually the back and Exchange Server
seventy aliases anyway

227
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,260
gray so if if you're from VA

228
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,920
emails architect Google Doc com and you
work at Google

229
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,650
that might also be a you know and he my
lawn acting like

230
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,209
on that excess I'm to keep it clean n
Easy

231
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:24,210
city

232
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,890
answers so once we have our a what we
have are less

233
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,640
upgraded from there what I like to do.
his life

234
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,860
yes

235
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,260
meta

236
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,540
and I just basically make things out
right like this one is a hey it's

237
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,189
obvious 60th birthday party

238
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,190
and I've Aussies widening an engagement
announcements and all the perfect things

239
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,620
what we're doing is we're probing the
organization

240
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,880
had to see you you know which he mother
actually valid

241
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm we have a lot of organizations tell
us that hey if it's not a valid e-mail

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,040
drop we have Microsoft come in and
configure game server

243
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,819
yeah now it still I was given as tough
cases back

244
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,140
but the cool thing about this is

245
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,670
especially during summer Christmas or
any other holidays as you get a lot of

246
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,719
nice bounce back for out of office

247
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,020
and it says hey I'm on vacation but you
can contact so and so

248
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,870
and then we look and say well we don't
have so-and-so and are less but we do

249
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,230
now

250
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,840
and also we get things like phone
numbers cell phone numbers may be for

251
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,990
the help desk with you can also include
in our

252
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,720
Minister gmail I one of the cool things
I got lately what's your email

253
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,370
disclaimer in all their language

254
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,960
that was at the bottom of one of the
emails I got sent back to us so we just

255
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,140
copied and pasted that in Arthur
phishing email

256
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,470
everything adds a little busy at that
email and also if you can put a valid

257
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,210
phone numbers and different things in
there

258
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,650
people ran like hell that is about
extension I know that's the helpdesk

259
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,220
phone

260
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,770
so I everything that we can view the
acid living

261
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,240
Friday

262
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,850
alright so

263
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,740
here's the most important up important
part up the whole thing is creating the

264
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,760
scenario right

265
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,590
because we want to have a scenario that
make sense with the organization that

266
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,550
we're targeting right

267
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,599
so the very first thing that we do is we
choose a domain

268
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,970
and now we register that domain we like
to use Go Daddy and we'll tell you on a

269
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,570
second

270
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,970
um I we like to register that domain and
I get out a real

271
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,920
email account the reason is that there's
a lot alike tools and scripts out there

272
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,189
that do email phishing and all that kind
of stuff but those are all caught by

273
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,920
spam filters you know they're on to that

274
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,939
no spam filters gonna let an email sent
by Reeve through

275
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,580
you know never gonna happen so what we
did I never get around that we figured

276
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:38,850
out

277
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,680
what the main thing is that they're
looking for in the main thing is that

278
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,099
email points on four as reverse DNS

279
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,600
so every verse the NSS and set up it'll
drop the email automatically so I'm

280
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,030
one of the things we that we love about
Go Daddy is that it gives you one free

281
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,260
webmail account when you register a
domain

282
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,850
himself so that's really all we need is
wifi that's really nice to them

283
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,920
I'm so so so that's the first thing that
we do we like to use you know

284
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,829
there's a million ways to register the
domain you can misspelled the quiet name

285
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,120
you can do all kinds of things we just
like to be quiet named Ash portal

286
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,640
because it's been working for years and
as fry gonna continue to work after this

287
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,069
talk which will be scary

288
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,350
um but that so we like to do and we'll
show you that there's a million ways you

289
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,590
can register the domain

290
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,970
on some scenarios that we like to use
some we like to use this open enrollment

291
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,030
scenario

292
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,040
basically preying on people for their
four O one K plans are their health

293
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,370
benefits and that never gets approved by
the way

294
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,610
agers spot found yeah we never get this
tutorial

295
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,690
we never get that one up for you were
still try and now

296
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,760
I am fine old one that we seize that
doesn't work anymore as the work from

297
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,720
home survey

298
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,110
I was a great one now you know we're
starting a pilot program

299
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,430
mom were only taking fifty people please
do not forward this to anyone else

300
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,849
you know I guess for register in this
site and um

301
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,520
and and you can work from home on
Fridays or something like that

302
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,569
that use to work but it's not working
all that much anymore I'm

303
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,770
we like to use the OWA upgrade um we use
this one the client wants a Badfish what

304
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,560
we call a Badfish sometimes they

305
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,399
sometimes they want something that some
unrealistic so they can get a base on

306
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,030
the weather clients are they don't
really want success

307
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm and this is modeled after the big
giant OWA upgrade fish that happen on

308
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,900
the internet a couple years ago and got
tons and tons of people

309
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,300
I'm so we have one modeled after that as
you know misspelled words and all this

310
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,839
stuff on it and so

311
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,970
I we use that sometimes and our very
favorite which is the one that we're

312
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,050
gonna demo here is the security report

313
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,879
this works everywhere because every
company has security

314
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,420
and every body likes to hear about

315
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,000
other people getting in trouble and so
we have this email that will show you in

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,780
a little bit that basically says

317
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,820
arm basically says that we just did a
security audit some people weren't

318
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,950
following the protocols you know some
people got in trouble some people Obama

319
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,640
Obama

320
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,620
you know download this report and you
can read it you know and and we got all

321
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,070
what we'll go over the mallets out but
but its

322
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,000
it's pretty convincing and a and and
just this works a hundred percent of the

323
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,650
time I've never had it not work

324
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,010
and we've done this a lot

325
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,879
so basically these are my big point
about creating the fish email

326
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,910
and the thing is that we're only
offensive you know we depend testing the

327
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,600
work we're talking about all this on the
offensive but if you're on the defense

328
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,990
%uh this stuff is just as important
because these are the five points you

329
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,880
can take back to your users and say

330
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,700
these are the things to look for in a
phishing email right so the subject line

331
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,240
has to be catchy right because if the
subject on the email as and catchy

332
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,200
no one's gonna open it right it's gotta
be easy to read it can be complicated

333
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,190
like some PhD professor harburg wrote it
it's got to be a normal

334
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:48,080
email commendation look legitimate right
so like Eric was talking about it should

335
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,560
have the footer from the company it
should have the phone number it should

336
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,169
all be spelled correctly

337
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,950
grammar should be right if I'm sending
out a call for email to everybody in my

338
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,590
corporation I'm gonna spelled grammar
check it like

339
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,699
a time so I don't like it idiot and so

340
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,970
so any email should look like that and
then

341
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,210
obviously have to give users a reason to
click on the link you know

342
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,860
there's gonna be some type of a link to
their malware a web portal some type of

343
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,229
thing so you have to entice them to
click on it and then the most important

344
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,560
thing it has to fit the organization you
would not send an email

345
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,610
you know about open enrollment benefits
for example to a company that has 90

346
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,340
percent part-time employees

347
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,669
right because they don't even have
insurance that would make sense so

348
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,470
so you have to make sure that if it's
the business enough and this is where

349
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,710
all that preliminary research goes and

350
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,340
to you know but we do have a psych
there's a marine everything about the

351
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,439
company a marine all their website
something you know what they do

352
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,720
you don't figure out how they make money
because that's what I want to attack you

353
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,820
know I'm not attacking their 80s armor I
mean

354
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,810
that's cool when all they get to get
domain admin but what i'm really after

355
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,510
is what they

356
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,560
what they make money off a where's the
profit because that's what a real

357
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
attackers after

358
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,720
yeah attackers don't care about an app
and they don't care about taking answer

359
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,140
what they want is a Westfield for Nokia

360
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,390
so here's this is our actual phishing
email and that we've created this for

361
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,400
the scenario but its

362
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,490
it's a exactly the same as what we would
use

363
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,370
I'm you'll notice here at the top it
comes from their information security

364
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,179
and assurance

365
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,320
um and one thing you wanna hear in for a
second humana dash for the lock arms

366
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,810
that's the domain that we've of

367
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,570
that should be one of the things that
the you know musician see there's not

368
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,320
really coming from internal email

369
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,800
a court we got involved here so we know
it's important visits from the officer

370
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,720
mace security insurance and as martin
was saying basically

371
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,640
at this just ate a as you as you guys
all know security that important aspect

372
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,920
of our business and keeping data secure
is important so

373
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,970
we did a security audit and

374
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,100
and me year the findings and

375
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,149
it basically entices them to click on
this link and one other thing to do

376
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,560
as we don't obscure links when they
hover over them

377
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,280
that's one thing that's hard to users
right look at the Lincoln acres on the

378
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,070
right place

379
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,850
that's the actual link that we use ass
like that we in bed

380
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,570
I'm so as not arouse suspicion a

381
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,030
so basically what we're doing here is
we're trying to give

382
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,230
and the uses a reason the plaque you to
build trust with them there

383
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,020
and we've got our information security
and assurance this is the actual address

384
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
to the side

385
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,410
this is the actual phone number like I
said if we can find a help desk phone

386
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,350
number something like that we use that
instead

387
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,679
we never use a person's name a
legitimate persons name within the

388
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,210
company

389
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,620
because we don't know who's in who's
going to do and if they're gonna call

390
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,760
that her son of a be like hey did you
send us e-mail alert for detail is a

391
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,879
disease emphysema

392
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,740
unless of course the customer
specifically asked us to do something

393
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,810
like that and you know

394
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,780
I am this is basically and thus humana
logo

395
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,550
was a quick search on Google for logo's
humana

396
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:55,120
I founded on the image is based on one
that fits on one of them look good

397
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,750
and the thing that you can see at the
bottom here but was shown in our other

398
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,350
e-mail

399
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,409
I we actually bring it up is the fighter

400
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,670
the legal disclaimer that we're talking
about got nice language in there again

401
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,030
it's just all these little things that
actually build trust you know

402
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,960
I'm the things that corporations telling
users to look for we tried to add

403
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,120
everything that we can

404
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,020
and to the Zeno alright so the next
important part is she's the attack

405
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,780
vector by the way other stuff is new
it's not revolutionary I'm it's all been

406
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,580
done before

407
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,189
um we just have have have at what did
some details and perfected that

408
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,770
perfected the task all this is old
school stuff and the scary part is that

409
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,690
it still working

410
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:39,410
I'm unfortunately cell um 20 tag factors
important obviously we got infected PDF

411
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,010
so I mean adobe has a zero day every
week I mean like a

412
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,060
there's there's nothing you can do about
that Word documents with macros I mean

413
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,320
who blindly enables were documents with
my gross on no injuries are him but a

414
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,210
way self

415
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,920
you know credential harvest team has a
lot of times if we look at your

416
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,540
I internet presence and you don't have
to factor of on your BB ends

417
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,780
we won't even worry about all this other
stuff will just try to get some

418
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,149
credentials with a vague OWA page or
something like that that's all we need

419
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,490
palm obviously malicious the axes and

420
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,860
are favored as the job put once again
now new not revolutionary but still

421
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,449
working

422
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,090
one thing to those first two and one of
the reasons one other things about this

423
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:19,840
talk is

424
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,570
what was that the on user awareness
because Lisa's first to you

425
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,629
there's people paid in the organization
to do nothing but

426
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,920
open PDF's all day HR legal

427
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,110
you know they're opening of all day so
we might have a different its eighth

428
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,629
year three different attacks

429
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,840
depending on the amount going to we can
separate it out and said that certain

430
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,850
exact age are

431
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,350
I will do that it'll be yeah PDF
babysitting going to the website

432
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,760
I can't tell you how many times I've
just sent my resume to an HR department

433
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,100
they'll be right up I X O

434
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,219
you as as your smile member also

435
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,640
basically right creating a website again
what we're looking for is building trust

436
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,430
with an easier

437
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,980
I'm so you can call a 40 page was like
something like that the social

438
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,210
engineering toolkit are you can build a
custom site

439
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,230
I do a mix of both so that we can have
both potential harvesting and your three

440
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,480
different payloads on

441
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,460
all a better within the site but
basically get what you're looking for is

442
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,260
looking for the color scheme you're
looking for their language

443
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,800
and we talked about searching google for
the logo images making sure that its

444
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,370
iraq

445
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,350
a lot of times a to you might have to do
a little bit more searching for their

446
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,129
actual 40 pages because

447
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,330
the image that they use for the customer
is usually different than the image that

448
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,730
they use for the intelsat

449
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:42,000
a you wanna mimic the organization save
icon right that little thing that's up

450
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
in the top 12

451
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,720
the the different tabs I mean that
doesn't sound like much but if you can

452
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,270
so that they're just another

453
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,320
just another level of trust that gets
filled I'm

454
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,560
use like it from the role website we
often look for on different security

455
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,429
a statement said thing to be monitored
those types of things will pop in case

456
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,190
is straight out and use that

457
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,610
one thing that I really like to do is
change the who is info

458
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,389
so the cool thing about go daddy: osha
talking about

459
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,830
0

460
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,519
the government

461
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,219
so it will be about Go Daddy is you can
change your view is information on the

462
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:17,629
fly

463
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:21,928
and all you gotta do is check the boxes
and yeah concept of commission they

464
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,989
don't call them they don't verify if
they don't do anything

465
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:28,029
so mark gonna bring up the ass for
Humana

466
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:35,029
to bring up our portal

467
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,820
word

468
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,490
now

469
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,760
so here yeah you

470
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,270
basically all it is I went out and did
who is who may not go

471
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:52,370
they give me all the contact information
that I need to gather I

472
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,699
I L you RI domain

473
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,930
paid and yeah I certify that this
organization is under my purview

474
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,239
and you're golden arraigned up for sale
at yeah

475
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,590
naked yeah

476
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,309
thing that I do different it at the
bottom it says the email addresses

477
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:15,490
I take something that they put on their
roster domain admin

478
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,440
saturn has to the end right and lots of
people are normally gonna catch that

479
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,650
so so just so you know here's their
here's the real who is that's out there

480
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,299
right now

481
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,470
0 ok collided

482
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,950
human portal good catch this

483
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,630
sorry I get nervous appear alright so
you can see

484
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,990
there are evil domain is legitimately
registered a humana incorporated at

485
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,490
whatever their addresses

486
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,549
no problem so just in case you have
users the check them

487
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:49,750
and yeah so the the only other thing is
if you are to look at the human data

488
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:55,849
Comm

489
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:59,439
right it's exactly the same I'm the one
thing that's different

490
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,639
that we do sometimes as well as we read
is very good at it but sometimes

491
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:07,668
yeah well actually look and see where
they're registering them and then

492
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,309
well actually register that's fine and
then it off it looks a hundred percent

493
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:12,229
legit

494
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:19,229
to to most people you know from the
naked eye

495
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:28,389
hikes annexing yeah I do is choose your
payload I'm carried up for a quick

496
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:32,710
air buyers are to Metasploit air by now
and as payloads and a mess boy is the

497
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,750
best all-around for this type of thing

498
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,140
on there's no reason to reinvent the
wheel I'm we like to use matar burger

499
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,540
um we basically spend all our time
Makeen

500
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,350
Metasploit payload bypass AB which is
actually not difficult but

501
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,600
sorry about the framework to tests I
guess we don't spend a lot of time on it

502
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,379
but some

503
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,000
hand I couple things that are important
about

504
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,620
about payloads when you're doing this
type of thing though is what type of

505
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,820
connection are you gonna get back on the
organization

506
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,419
I'm PCB obviously just uses whatever
port but again sparked all the time

507
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,770
nowadays also there's egress filtering

508
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,500
proxies and all that kind of thing so we
don't use that anymore very often

509
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,440
HTTP and HTTPS works every single time
because

510
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,960
once it impacts the computer actually
uses the proxy information in that

511
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,330
computer to bypass the proxy internal
the rubber shell out

512
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,970
I'm plus AC TBS as everybody knows is a
binary stream so unless you have some

513
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,890
type device

514
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,520
that's doing deep packet inspection
there's no way you're gonna catch the

515
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,240
malware

516
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,470
Donnelly now um the only other one we
use one we're in a pinch when we know

517
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,740
there's really tied egress filtering on
the way out

518
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,380
I is reversed TCB all ports which
basically start support number one

519
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,600
and it runs every single port until I
get cell and I

520
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,280
you be surprised people think they have
their network also DUP tight but there's

521
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,510
something that gets out somewhere you
know somebody open some

522
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,640
you know our PC port way up in the 6000
sir something that

523
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,140
that gets out um and then defeated Navy

524
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,290
obviously back to what I was talking
about researching the company we want to

525
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:02,960
find out what kind

526
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,350
maybe the company has it's really easy
you got on LinkedIn and you look at the

527
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,750
company's job postings

528
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,430
and you look for I need a semantic
expert 0

529
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:16,470
also you know think about when you make
a job posting because you want somebody

530
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,010
that can specifically work on what you
have right cell

531
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,490
I need an expert in OWA exchange 2010 or
whatever

532
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,500
now I know what kinda mail server you're
running I need expert and

533
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,250
McAfee you know deployments now I know
I'm up against McAfee AV so

534
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,320
I so another thing to think about
putting your information out on the

535
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,909
Internet the other thing that we do is
obviously we have custom Packers the all

536
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,750
binary a

537
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:45,760
obfuscation another thing that we do I'm
as we digitally sign our binaries and we

538
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,550
digitally sign our job Apple which were
getting ready to show you we have our

539
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,379
own search we got a legit company we're
gonna go

540
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,690
I'm you can actually my accompany for a
couple hundred bucks in an LLC

541
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,200
I'm you can get the certificates from Go
Daddy for another couple hundred bucks

542
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,100
so you can be totally legit

543
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,679
on the Internet you know for 56 honor
box no problem

544
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,040
my digital signed binary it was a fellow
some online it was one phone call from

545
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,430
Go Daddy they asked me three questions
and him I had a and israel's

546
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,930
answer seems like we skipped some time
we did

547
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:21,870
so

548
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,419
let's look at our website it's not

549
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,490
it's actually actually is centered on
looks legit it's the resolution on the

550
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,500
screen that's fortunate of inside but

551
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,730
this is our game and a website that we
created I

552
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,929
basically week 11 and therefore dole's
we got the employee login with the lock

553
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:40,280
so it's secure

554
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,120
yeah block makes it secured on this
hearing known as

555
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,939
got the whole nine yards like and and
this is what we'll look legit

556
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,429
to humana people right so what's a
secure the top tier so we've got secure

557
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:55,730
and the company name so we're getting an
unlock so

558
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,809
so we took our trust we took our
humanity that report on we had a sub

559
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:02,340
domain of securities everybody likes
that word on know it sounds stupid but

560
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,178
it works

561
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,250
secure guys might be thinking I'm not
gonna click on it I think about all the

562
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,160
people next year the people at the water
cooler or like

563
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,040
you know the other thing that we got as
I

564
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,760
if you have trouble logging in we got

565
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,470
we gotta help desk you can just chat
live with the whole rise just run this

566
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,640
binary and all you gotta do is i i love
you see there

567
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,520
bottom but I gotta do is install health
that's the ICU right down here

568
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,580
that site and that tells you right there
okay I will help you out with logging

569
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:32,990
and

570
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,820
and the cool thing about this is we're
talking about the digital sign binaries

571
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,520
is and Firefox and IE or Firefox and ie9

572
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,950
I'm in order for I use a run executed
more

573
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,059
now they've got something like fire 62
that they download something of the

574
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,860
internet's perceive it's an EXE

575
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,040
and it's not sign when we did sleaze on
our side of

576
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,540
you get a nice grain checkbox it goes
right there and says this is a trusted

577
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,940
source they've got you know this
keychain

578
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,600
so they're good to go hides an hour
gonna show you our tack we're gonna

579
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,610
gonna put it all together

580
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,969
there was one more slide in there that I
must have deleted on accident but I'm

581
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,799
just gonna I

582
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,650
we're just gonna show here so basically
this is a a

583
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,390
this is our website he has a listener

584
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,440
I'm getting right to so basically all we
do start up a plane all

585
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,260
Metasploit listener hopefully the
