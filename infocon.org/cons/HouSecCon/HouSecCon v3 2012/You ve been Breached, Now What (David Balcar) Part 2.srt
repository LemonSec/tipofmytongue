00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,929
gone should act was any of pressure

84
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,250
let's ivory I think that's the

85
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,389
because with the guys two years ago
there you go out to the side of the

86
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:16,669
company will have

87

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,550

like this to

97
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,419
another I'll Michael

98
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:06,750
are outside go out

99
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,199
on so yepson tools and coarseness is
candor

100
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,460
yesterday backtrack tile

101
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,479
up well that fire is

102
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,758
alls he's out there I think

103
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,810
by up so we do

104
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,530
here if you have roots we've got into

105
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,919
right don't show your races out there
from the bat

106
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,490
so what we do will document who what
when where

107
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,289
who were anywhere servers neff

108
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:44,919
ages and get all the instances someone
like myself again

109
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,219
I've gotta do this anyway some cuz I'm
trying to figure out where they came in

110
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,389
because they might come in from multiple
places you know we have

111
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,449
finest if someone's re-start do this
it's just a coincidence for

112
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,190
say says

113
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,650
the events know the five-step a lot on
staff

114
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,770
won't know if I'm or we have reached

115
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,130
we told the CIO you know we're keeping
it quiet

116
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,190
well guess what you talk to your help
yes

117
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,680
top-tier other means is but

118
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,009
9 phone calls only like Zac with

119
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:23,110
yes there all the people that work while
computers

120
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,240
involved in for phones because the
castle

121
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,349
secure backups if I K

122
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:33,190
three sons L by who is on back

123
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,560
secure back okay is that happens once
but twice 3

124
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,130
multiple times people that greets they
go

125
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,270
where we go well guess what these people
have been in your network for a while

126
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,530
for you problem so if you can if you go
back two weeks

127
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,219
and bruises still there next week still
there that drew kid

128
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,620
that now where you restore is we just
came back to your network

129
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,000
okay it's free know your face

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,440
know what your network looks like today
what is it likely

131
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,479
was a look like a wire with Windows
Server like

132
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,780
remembering something like to require
one person

133
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,520
you know it's true that was like you
know two servers like right so something

134
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,159
changes

135
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,280
you know something going here school at

136
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,198
okay if you're not trying to identify
other intruder

137
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,669
yet the Internet at least for a short
time

138
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:34,120
noises so they're not working against
you while you're trying to get them out

139
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,339
K I i've had at both sides of the clay I
had a customer

140
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,050
that want to identify the intruder so we
acceded

141
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,839
fatherhood we traced back to London to a
small village

142
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,339
outsell kids as balls base K

143
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:55,709
and he broke into an insurance company
integrates

144
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:59,170
his ex's and started to mess around

145
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,270
it wasn't I still think they can use for
a couple movies

146
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,699
music in what we call it a look at the
system

147
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:10,020
and the screen is moving around those
guys popping up FTP servers and he's

148
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,079
lonely music and

149
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,160
and IT guy said there from the company's
core man loses turn a survivor of a

150
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,620
minor league free movies

151
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,610
a somebody

152
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,310
face own

153
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,540
so how to lower risk profiles all talk
about risk right with our risk profile

154
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,219
if we have a really really high risk
what we have to do to mitigate

155
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,910
think that is a maximum security prison
right well they didn't know what is the

156
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,569
risk layers of security

157
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,829
K on the street fair electric big
retailers I guess

158
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:49,099
you know he said he said it perfectly
overs awareness securities like bonds

159
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,190
layers

160
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,690
cake is if I get past the first layer
you know

161
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,779
maybe that was easy hey that's the
second where

162
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,829
now if I have the first exactly are they
are all the same people

163
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:04,449
it's true you're right through it hours
earlier

164
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:08,770
I don't like runs they may be in style
and security technologies on the server

165
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,480
side

166
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,130
stop because these guys like it in these
guys might not

167
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,640

enough long

181
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,910
you know there's good there's good SEM
solutions and not so that some solutions

182
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,689
okay there's chief warns expensive this
Fri 17

183

K get something okay

184
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,079
minutes man it's tough out there is
pretty darn good

185
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,800
you know where you don't have to watch
it but

186
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,969
if you're not alone in this to you like
to see it

187
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,579
you not have a record %uh what happened
with okay

188
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:36,180
and those things are going to be a lot
of of the case

189
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,930
biometrics token smart cards you know so

190
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,300
other authentication a couple of those
now whether the nurses wear

191
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,050
they're having ID card right now they're
going up to the carts you know

192
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,890
it happen use that as the law and med it
makes it easier for their

193
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,730
but its to factor right something I i
have to carry on okay

194
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,010
I know you're saying I thats self

195
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,300
years on earth so

196
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,000
this is where I for a better tomorrow I
got your back guide

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,089
you know I needed update is right here
this fall down because

198
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,770
they're probably already in the network
right

199
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,089
so that's why tell people think about
that there are their

200
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,800
however find however law how I keep them
out

201
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,029
I worked at a job in Boston recently

202
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:31,279
and the company was breached we see
physically active

203
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,890
gave me advice and watch everything
going out there network that happens

204
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,350
here

205
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,670
players they were I'm prime example are
all

206
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,770
good and we actually watched

207
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,250

so don't say

212
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,290
the problem there was all this day was
going out there

219
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,569
as fast as they really miss machines
more risky

220
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:28,719
from our go talk in stride data out

221
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,020

that

238
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,920
for

239
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,990
up of he

240
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,020
all this was released because and I
mistook the entire database

241
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,120
they said look at the number records in
the database okay

242
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,260
that's all they had a his always yeah

243
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,760
still out there it so they're all afire
Bey

244
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,780
toward well

245
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,850
other companies up today himself are
some are

246
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,990
cell don't want to tell you only nose
and eyes

247
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,810
school yeah water no yesterday's

248
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,380
come from forensics to try to figure out
what happened how many

249
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,670
okay on here on this database this is
the estimated number

250
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,250
if this database yes four thousand
records we have to assume

251
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,870
if we see the database leaving we know
they got there

252
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,190
so after those numbers bus

253
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,400
user 3 say okay it's about back

254
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,810
here size three days there's a rest
average size

255
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,380
no

256
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,990
sometimes you can but I think it's more
from we see

257
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,270
data why I did this K como okay

258
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,380
sales guys deserve that stealing much
information

259
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,530
and we actually he was trent

260
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,010
the go out today out a when Carl

261
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,060
we know that you only got 3/4

262
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,400
day so we knew approximately how much
you got now

263
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,670
verses what's left so

264
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,719
let the other hand some company don't
for

265
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,110
because that what they don't look that
Press right

266
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,340
because if they look bad Press think our
stuff

267
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,460
their own by well

268
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,550
you know all stuff that's

269
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,920
as the biggest a yeah

270
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,240
yeah yet complete things you know Delhi

271
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,920
you know you're dead you know to start
you

272
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,120
really should he credit card no worries

273
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,470
to keep your if they process it comes
back

274
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,080
you can't organize it come back and say
okay we

275
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,400
this is that user or whatever not keep
the card numbers

276
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,980
you know and a lot of it has to do with
for sale systems

277
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,449
people who make those of our because
there would be a really

278
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:13,990
trying to do is e-zines quickly as they
can in this one

279
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,490
I've worked actions working with FBI

280
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,089
any FBI can say

281
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,458
see Collins okay how much else going

282
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,330
I got a free drink yeah here we go

283
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:36,210
alright see me after class II was cured
myself Collins kids always see

284
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:41,370
you know FBI worked with that stuff it's
funny so the only those are

285
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,560
to anyways up

286
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,290
is working with this company

287
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,830
look into their stuff up for sales
people the white carpet

288
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,889
its it's incredibly because you have a
voice so guys

289
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,030
in the glittery star white well

290
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,480
you know I is this for real this
particular your story on track to

291
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
information

292
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,420
everything's there so why restoring it
there

293
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,240
waste wood because when I started the
investigation

294
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,520
at this particular favorites I I said I
would start interviewing people

295
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,720
so I their server people for

296
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,940
the people processing carts 12
accounting

297
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,000
and other stuff nicer interview with
those guys show industry

298
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,910
should bring on the screen it was so the
last four digits

299
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,010
but I know this up on the screen

300
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,330
there was a manager access f9 bring

301
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,010
there's the whole very hard because I
say this I ask for a very important

302
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,650
question

303
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,670
what you doing some work also says K I

304
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,720
disputing that are I'm you credit them
back

305
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,770
to use I'll I just have not here's my
broker nevertheless

306
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,030
yeah but I like

307
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,210
you should that okay they should give
you the card in it

308
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,540
look at some retailers now you know when
you go for refund within a few

309
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,070
I have the original are swipe it it for
the money back

310
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,300
okay that would be

311
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,399
way better him you can't you can
actually feel six digits

312
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,040
you can't eat six digits so when you
call up say

313
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,230
I've I frequently order takedown

314
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,420
and they keep records on file all the
time

315
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,360
investors away may keep something they
can submit for comes out if it's a

316
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,020
if it's in cryptic it spends a little
for sales of them there is some

317
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,820
for the cells of the earth that will
