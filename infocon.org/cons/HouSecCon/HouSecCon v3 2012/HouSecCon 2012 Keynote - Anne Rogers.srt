1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,460
who come speak to you today I have a
warm spot in my heart for him

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,710
anything Houston oriented because I
think a lot of times

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,679
people minimize what happens in the city
for a huge place in a lot of security

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,700
professionals

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,039
really work on their own and we need to
gather together so take up this morning

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,289
I know

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:23,529
I looked at the technical tracks in this
conference and its

8
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:26,730
fantastic Michael did a great job point
things together

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,800
so I thought the last thing you need is
a kickoff

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,940
thats technical you gonna be inundated
with all kinds aboard some slides

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,949
so what I wanted to do this morning's
top you about

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,660
a different approach in it and kinda
move a philosophical been

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,050
on what you need to do is security
professionals 90 we have a mix in the

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,019
audience for people that are really in

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,500
deep on the technical side above
configuring systems working with

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,680
technology we have the Management Group

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,879
they're trying to figure out how they
manage their programs

18
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,018
on take you step further and one other
things that I want to do when we start

19
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,740
stop about where we've been and where
we're going so with that in mind

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,189
things used to be simpler in the old
days

21
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:19,169
that we had huge mainframes in data
centers and we have controls around

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,080
those we knew where our data was it
every time we've

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,009
we walked in the door and we know who
connected because they can only come in

24
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:26,920
one way

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,090
things are easier to control

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,090
frankly the threats were different
technology wasn't as chief it was easy

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,689
to recognize those threats we gonna know
what they look like

28
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:44,820
you had some forethought of course I
don't what was coming out soon

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,189
and even though they sometimes
outnumbered you you felt pretty safe on

30
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,470
knowing how to fight that

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,619
that's an important thing to

32
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,020
to realize today as we know how to
recognize threats run

33
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,110
no was on a panacea there was no one
owns

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,780
and back then what you didn't know

35
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,300
you might be dangerous right and so

36
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,349
it was strange out there are other
places the

37
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:15,069
we thought they were unknown threats you
didn't go there

38
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,299
you didn't open it up and that was an
approach that was what fairly except

39
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,120
that don't fit

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,000
those of us that have the gray hair work
in those data centers in on those as a

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,819
name that works

42
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,879
we know how that felt like fun and then
all changed on us

43
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,239
it's gotten complicated first ball

44
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,900
routing technology and user communities
just perjurers

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,110
and on top of that

46
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,709
the threats change to the letter arms

47
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,750
these days right there were more
powerful weaponry

48
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,360
know a lot more power on the desk option
in the mobile homes in remote devices

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,909
now

50
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:04,079
than we ever imagined about them Oil
City is get used to it

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,659
technology happens in there are things
that are going to come at us

52
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,209
from it every direction no

53
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,540
philosophically there's a difference in
how your mind works when you get to that

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,459
stage right

55
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,349
thoroughly dimensions of things that we
have to look at

56
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,798
and understand and sometimes it's bigger
than any one person can handle

57
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,220
so it's very important to use teamwork
and that's where something like a

58
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,180
conference like this really helps

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,360
you can't be an expert in all the fields
where

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,780
we need to know what's going on and so
the

61
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,069
the security communities are very
important share the knowledge sure the

62
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:45,060
expertise

63
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,620
know how it will all lawyers great

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,299
so we do a lot of discussions about what
you can and can't say

65
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,290
no tell you that that's great in the
business world in the agreements

66
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,790
your security community I encourage you
to share information among yourselves

67
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,250
for you really need to team up against
the guys because

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,409
the bad guys are sharing you have to
realize that

69
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,569
you can stand alone these days on

70
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,228
the side of the defense so as we look at
the

71
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,039
major dimensions are what's going on in
the electronic environment

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,009
and are totally interconnect the world's
where your refrigerator now we're

73
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:28,509
talking a microwave I mean that's really
getting crazy

74
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,919
right what happens when everything's
network together

75
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,490
was so messed up his sorta meaningless
to us in terms of protecting our

76
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,930
corporate assets or intellectual
property

77
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,160
for national defense for certain things
in aging

78
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,620
to protect so we have to think in
different dimensions now

79
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,880
and have a different approach know we've
got a lot of different threats

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,380
if you look at the world around us

81
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,150
with all the power on the different
desktops and servers and things that are

82
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,008
well within

83
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,250
anybody's economic means to pick up I
mean

84
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,289
the iPhone I have on my bill has more
memory and more capability

85
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,419
than the huge computer I work with
oysters for starring Colin

86
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,789
nothing fill the room so now you've got
all the stuff running around with that

87
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:20,520
kind of power

88
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,240
and you've got the wily user who has it
in his hand

89
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,600
and nine times out of ten we find that a
lot of the threats on the problems we

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,940
run into our because

91
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,870
somebody figure it out accidentally how
do you something

92
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,110
can break something those

93
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,490
incidental ways that people break our
systems over make mistakes

94
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,570
and find the software bugs that nobody
thought about are real headaches for us

95
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,639
know that doesn't minimize the factors
there are a lot of

96
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,229
really focus threats now

97
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,289
and there's a dark side about this
connection

98
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:02,250
certainly do we're faced with that kind
of a problem every day

99
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,900
security professionals what happens we
get looking at

100
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,818
what we have to look at day-to-day the
focus shifts

101
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:15,419
from the latest threat to what's going
on can the interesting thing about you

102
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,630
is its at a dip nobody in their right
mind runs around these days with

103
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,000
systems that have no anti-virus on
that's like a given baselines got me

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,880
there

105
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,180
we all know that isn't the thing that
solves everything but you certainly

106
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,030
can't run around naked without it

107
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,049
right and so what's happened over time
is

108
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,819
we see the baseline security moving
upward

109
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,130
and the expectations moving up saying
you got at least have all that stuff in

110
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,810
place that we know about

111
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,000
has secured professionals now we're
challenged

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,400
because you have to look at all those
broad spectrum of threats

113
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,758
that are known threats to make sure that
you somehow have addressed under-covered

114
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,940
it or no

115
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,669
what its threat is against your
environment

116
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,719
that's a challenge to keep all in your
head right

117
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,690
that's all part of the problem we have
these days is looking at the complexity

118
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,539
love combining all those things together
and those are things we know

119
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,139
all the items it the condo come at us
from the corrections

120
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,410
that we expect to show up at her door
smits we haven't

121
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,300
make sure we counter them or mitigate
them

122
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,319
says we do that we keep a run after
those things

123
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,949
and trying to be on down and it gets to
be like the weapon all game

124
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:41,220
if you look at the definition I don't
know if you can read that

125
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,160
but it's the practice have repeatedly
getting just getting at something we're

126
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,620
hitting something

127
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,430
only to have more things their same pop
up again somewhere else

128
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,979
it's a losing proposition get that's
where your focus is

129
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,258
and so we have to understand that's
gonna happen to us

130
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,949
but if that's where you're looking and
that's how you tryna final

131
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:08,099
it's a losing proposition

132
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,080
the world has changed than anybody
that's in the security profession has

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,599
seen these headlines over and over

134
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,060
there's something new everyday so what's
the most striking thing about all

135
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,720
some things in headlines today

136
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,289
nation-state international the level of
sophistication

137
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:33,250
has changed used to be the or hacker
community did a two count cool on people

138
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,250
a broken hahaha back out used to be
amazed at how can I mostly hacking was

139
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,589
back in the old days things I could have
done that they didn't

140
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:47,170
sup the same today and when you look at
what's happening today you have to look

141
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,089
at motivations

142
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,019
take a step back and think about all
what is driving this kind have

143
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:58,029
situation certainly we all know if you
are in business communities you know

144
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,350
that there's economic incentive

145
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,730
out the kazoo why

146
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,880
is everybody going there there's big
money in it now

147
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,269
we have run to put our commerce in our
assets

148
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,890
online network together passing back and
forth

149
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,850
the the company jewels are in the ether

150
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,420
right my bill saying goes

151
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,529
right you rob banks because that's where
the money is while you after that

152
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,470
because that's where the money is

153
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,589
and so we had seen in the past several
years

154
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:34,180
the growth really sophisticated criminal
activity

155
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,010
because that's where the money is than
anybody that has had identity theft or

156
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,890
credit card fraud happen to them and I
would wager that

157
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,990
family in this room have had a problem
for the private or charge in identity

158
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,480
theft

159
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,740
incident yeah pretty typical

160
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,089
I'd say at least thirty to forty percent
people here in Canada

161
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:58,190
I myself have no it's a typical problem

162
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,300
there are different protections and
solutions that we have to just normally

163
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,469
now apply

164
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,310
in that kind of environment and so

165
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,189
as we look at that world the economic X
incentive is there

166
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,019
in the criminal typeof organizations
that like to go around those banks those

167
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,440
with chronic banks

168
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,850
have plenty money to pain for good
skills these days to go to Bel

169
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,630
so we're not up against the high school
happen in a corner anymore

170
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,410
frankly we're up against people have
very good skills very good interest in

171
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,390
technology

172
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,819
share shamelessly with each other which
is one or more

173
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,720
my main concern right we keep our
secrets

174
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,260
cause our lawyers so as to not cuz we're
always been told make sure you protect

175
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,339
your information

176
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,310
and the guys that are after us are
sharing like raising their posting

177
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,609
online here's how to go break something
else

178
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,200
scare the passwords that we found over
here

179
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,450
so we have this horrible army is a skill

180
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,959
attacks threats now pounding on their
doors on a daily basis

181
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,510
your perspective has to change on how
you defend against that

182
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,920
the next step that we found certainly
was not enough time for a min

183
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,160
in the follow-on is there are other big
guns and there now too

184
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,060
the fact is that sire or for cyber
threats

185
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,310
are no involving nation-states

186
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,599
say that while big-money different
common surname

187
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,160
different kind so philosophical sent

188
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,579
on how to get an hour places what's a
key characteristic of that kind of

189
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:39,920
activity

190
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,939
how long did it take you to figure out
that Stuxnet was there

191
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,579
or flame was there this is a still
factor

192
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,149
it's no longer I got an hour I'm telling
people about it they don't want to know

193
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,389
the burner

194
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:57,470
they don't want you know they still are
there

195
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,089
and so part of this factor work with
espionage

196
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:06,350
thats being sponsored and supported by
nation states

197
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,709
is that they're pretty good at hiding
what they're doing

198
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,880
and we're now in the room the spot I'm
saying do I even know if I've been

199
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,529
compromised or even know if I have a
thread

200
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:22,620
someplace in my apartment or can I tell
when it's in and out other

201
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,959
there's some interesting work now with
the analysis on lisa says men around for

202
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,569
a long time

203
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,079
over you sitting hiding working

204
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,229
in the things as most scary is what's
happening now is this comes out I'll

205
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,070
the original group that did this
targeted tiger attack targeted stealthy

206
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,160
work had focused targets

207
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,740
but the as I said the hacker communities
and the

208
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,480
criminal communities they're not so
discerning

209
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,230
they also discriminating discriminating
where they go

210
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,720
and they fear famously as soon as they
know how this works you now see very

211
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,480
it's coming out like crazy

212
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,300
and frankly there may not be as good
coaters mean they don't know how to

213
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,839
control as well

214
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,440
and so by accident even someone is best
for those got out into unintended places

215
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,829
now is more more people pick up that
same attack technology is

216
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:24,109
shove it in the Metasploit or someplace
else

217
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,970
you've got people that pick up the 2010
use it

218
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,519
and they're not discriminating in their
attack you get hit

219
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,160
even by accident cuz I make mistakes

220
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,160
so it's something we have to think about

221
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,680
how it on top of that the we've also
seen that there are another class

222
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,050
abusers

223
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,949
for another possible threats out there
they're even worse to predict

224
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:51,660
thats people that have political or so
so shows Rogen those

225
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,469
philosophical agendas and

226
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,730
they're not economically motivated per
se

227
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,899
they may not have national boundaries
but they have different views the world

228
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,339
now go take an inventory over those
threats

229
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:11,639
those opponents you find them all over
the place

230
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,579
and will be on the fringe ends some
fairly reasonable

231
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:19,279
concerns about social or economic

232
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,750
environments the fringe groups

233
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,740
will jump on and use a technology to
come and perpetrate whatever

234
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,630
attacked they think is worthy over their
position

235
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,959
you up against them to and sometimes
there are the hardest one to protect

236
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,670
so another the press to totally on what
you have to face every day

237
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,930
we have to stop looking down in the
weeds

238
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,989
right now we have to change your
perspective

239
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,649
instead a run around do in the
whack-a-mole look at the trees trying to

240
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:55,250
figure out what the next biggest threat
is

241
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,880
we have to step back a bit change to
that

242
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,420
let's back up and take a look at what's
happening

243
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,099
where we are with the environment looks
like today

244
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,199
soul because it from this to this

245
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,219
or maybe even this

246
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,790
security professionals whether you're
down in the trenches working on the

247
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,099
technology

248
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,459
for your in the man mid management
levels or in in the strategic levels

249
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:28,060
you need to think about something that's
very important

250
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:34,089
where are you headed do you have a
strategic plan for your security program

251
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,329
you know what you're trying to
accomplish

252
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:39,750
yes all those things is if you don't
know where you're going how do you know

253
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,540
when you get there

254
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,319
my par this is deciding what your
program needs to look like what your

255
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,839
environment and what your

256
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,060
organization needs to have been
protections

257
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,239
what you're trying to do out there as a
business for as an entity

258
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,940
and how you're gonna swim in a
shark-infested waters

259
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,110
right

260
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,220
does everything you do every project
every incident response

261
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,240
effort anything you're working on your
environment

262
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,300
does that move you closer to what are
your goals and your strategic plan

263
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,949
because if you put in a temporary fix
but it's out on the French someplace or

264
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:19,758
supposed to what you're trying to get
through in the end game

265
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,490
you're wasting time and energy and you
can afford these things

266
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,100
part of the problem we have today is
that security budgets never

267
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,779
grows fast has the technology features
right

268
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,630
we're always on catch-up mode will know
that

269
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,639
in the demand is there before we even
know how r to manager fix it

270
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,110
we may not even know how to implement
right but on walks in the door

271
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,269
that's an uncomfortable position but
it's one of the things as fact of life

272
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:51,910
these days

273
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,180
so when you step into a free on a
project for your working on trying to

274
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,420
fix an incident or

275
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,969
our do in some response merger with
something that came up

276
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,760
as you look at solutions and fixes you
need to keep in your mind where you want

277
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,129
to be in the end game

278
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,760
this is a very important step it's a
very important thing because otherwise

279
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,439
you're in a lot more mood

280
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,500
you can't win that game

281
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,720
knows will note on the bottom says
technology helps tremendously

282
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,980
it's not the goal we have to rely on
technology

283
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,150
to step back and think how would you
physically today

284
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,100
handle manual intervention or viruses

285
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,889
can do it thanks you've got to have the
technology to look at any bars

286
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,280
isn't 100 percent effective now you go
10 days out there

287
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,020
but there's of a lot of stuff the
coaches and keeps an earlier

288
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,090
way same thing anti-spyware looking at

289
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,970
what's going on with the OP
implementations

290
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,140
you need the technology and you don't
vendors out here that offer a lot of

291
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,660
neat stuff

292
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,110
would you have to know where you tryna
go with that just because he's got a

293
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,949
great product

294
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,990
plunking down in your environment may or
may not help you a lot if you don't know

295
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,660
what's post the interface with that how
it's gonna go

296
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,039
because there is no one panacea Products

297
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,390
there is no one no magic bullet
technology

298
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,679
you gotta be able to from mine can
manage and integrate that stuff to make

299
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,340
it work

300
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,600
that's a challenge guys because that
technology is changing as fast as the

301
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,649
threat to change

302
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,880
they're trying to catch up with what's
happening out there percy wood

303
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,039
is in their environment right

304
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:44,770
and they were more concerned to try to
sell you a really good product

305
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,039
here in san dimas try to figure out how
that technology applies

306
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,360
in your environment to your goals

307
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,340
so you may find a whiz-bang product that
really doesn't meet what you need to do

308
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,330
it doesn't make sense to get a right

309
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,500
so I think as you take a step back and
look at the larger picture

310
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,740
yup there's a side what for integrate
your environment

311
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,510
to move you toward your goals and your
strategic plan

312
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,879
and doggone yes take it take it manager
the

313
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,039
information and the capabilities that
the technology has helped offer

314
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,120
take a look at that for those members
come to offer you a

315
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,479
a demo of what it can do take the demo
take a look at it if you got time

316
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,299
because you need understand what people
are doing to try to your

317
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:35,539
improve your environment controls or
mitigate threats

318
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:38,950
doesn't mean you have to buy it you have
to understand how that may or may not

319
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,559
apply in your world

320
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,600
and you got to cooperate with each other
get

321
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,219
it's really important do you understand
your own capabilities

322
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,100
what can you protect what can to protect

323
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,918
that has more to do with how your
environment is structured and how your

324
00:19:58,919 --> 00:19:59,950
business or your

325
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,809
hinted he operates than it does with the
technology

326
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:08,200
I can build walls around things that are
pretty impenetrable

327
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,440
but if that business can operate in that
environment

328
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,520
sort was ever you have to understand
what happens in your environment terms

329
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,090
and

330
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,629
information transfer information access
button

331
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:26,539
information-sharing and where the really
critical stuff is

332
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:31,049
now that's been a conundrum for most
security professionals all along

333
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:34,639
how many have you have had the
discussion with your groups say in

334
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,080
who's the data owner and where's the
most critical they live right

335
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,908
this is like the in the circle %ah don't
know as the IT guys no no no wait a

336
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:42,299
minute

337
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:47,250
the the IT guys are the custodians there
the Guardians my protectors

338
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,390
they don't own stuff it's a very
difficult question because

339
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,600
business people really don't know how to
answer that well

340
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,678
and so sometimes you have to ask the
question five different ways

341
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,900
from different perspectives before you
get some other good answers

342
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,840
sometimes you have to take the first
shot at do an inventory of things you

343
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,418
think are important and go in and

344
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:13,440
and talk to me and say is this I got it
right star-telegram a baseline ground

345
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,039
that they don't have to the start from
scratch you do some that will work

346
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,780
but if you don't know what you have to
protect and you don't know how it has to

347
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,809
flow in your business operations

348
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:25,500
you're never going to figure out how to
apply technology or controls

349
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,679
steps to get the job done so it's a
really

350
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,549
tough question they ask you need to know
what you can do

351
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,360
and what you can't do so first of all
you need to know what you can protect

352
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,750
and what you can't forget

353
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,990
and then you need to know where you can
protect it and where you can protect the

354
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,809
member those lawyers those artificial
boundaries we work with every day

355
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,928
there times when you can't reach across
and so all of this stuff up sober

356
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:52,070
partners and learn

357
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,220
summer when you're relying on contracts
and agreements to help you out

358
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,799
you better know what that language or
look like because a la the procurement

359
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,200
people in the business folks don't know

360
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,860
what you need to have included in there
to help you protect that they do

361
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,959
so you gotta learn a little bit about
contracting and

362
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,669
risk assessments and information
agreements

363
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,390
with partners and entities that your
change table with

364
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,250
comes as part of a tear for now that
we're all so doggone interconnected

365
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,070
also better understand the risk appetite
over your organization

366
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,908
know how many have you take a risk
assessment or risk management classes

367
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:36,980
a few okay it's really important thing
to think about

368
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,950
the teacher is class while over at your
age and one other things

369
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,390
I asked people's what are some of the
most risky things you do every day all

370
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,390
and icons they're often is facing think
about menu

371
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,490
their credit card so how about driving
on his my way

372
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,450
every morning you get in your car when
you take off down the road and you hop

373
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,059
on that highway and you're going seventy
miles an hour

374
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,610
you note 65 limit

375
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,000
with by millions of people are doing the
same thing and we've been in and out and

376
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,620
what are you doing

377
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,719
you can tailgate if you use them and
you're assuming that everybody else is

378
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,750
going to follow the rules

379
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,059
right most dangerous place in the world
is seven miles an hour for moving down

380
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:20,899
the highway

381
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,000
with all these other guy are people
doing the same thing and meanwhile

382
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,140
they're brushing her hair regrowth of
them on the phone and texting

383
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,280
decided they had to get off at that exit
three lines over

384
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,399
and yet do we stop driving to work
because that's really really dangerous

385
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,950
now we accept those risks because we
have a utility

386
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,299
that says it really make sense for me is
very bad I will review get from my house

387
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:51,240
to my place a business every morning so
I won't accept that risk can go there

388
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,120
that we think about it every day about
what those risks are

389
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,639
probably not if you did too much they
call Michael can you

390
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,669
but the fact is you do a lot risk
acceptance in your life

391
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:06,340
for some very dangerous things and
that's your

392
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,740
risk acceptance appetite the
organization does the same thing

393
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,659
and you have to understand what kind of
a risk acceptance environment you have

394
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:16,610
or

395
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,389
a risk avoidance a buyer you have in
your organization

396
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,440
because if you don't understand how that
operates

397
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,909
you'll be spitting in the wind when you
try to talk to about

398
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:34,669
dangers out in the universe right your
network world

399
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:38,620
your job half the time is to make people
aware about the risks

400
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,719
because some people don't know it I talk
to relatives who jump on the internet do

401
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,080
over in a banking post to social
networks and all this stuff and have a

402
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,720
clue what they've just expose themselves
to

403
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,690
they don't understand the risks and if
you go to a little bit and explain it to

404
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,429
him

405
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:58,980
you know it's like the eyes get wide
cool I guess I should could all that out

406
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,120
there that way

407
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,049
their ways to do it safely love ways not
to do it right

408
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:08,830
and so some other issue comes into
making sure you can communicate what the

409
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,350
dangers look like out there

410
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,209
without sounding like an alarmist you
have to be realistic

411
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,909
once you've given them an idea what
those risks look like

412
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:23,529
then the business make serious decisions
thanks

413
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:28,299
so if you understand if I work for a
very conservative banking group for an

414
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:29,389
Insurance Group

415
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,120
they're pretty risk-averse people they
may not want us to put in the latest

416
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,570
greatest technology combinations I've
never been tried before

417
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,129
not directly if you're a start-up that
those a lot of innovative things and

418
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,270
they're willing to invest them do
venture capital

419
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,279
different different kinda environment
right understand who you talking to

420
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,850
emerged and Hulu understand and support
the plans are you have

421
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,928
for trying to protect them

422
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,370
that's a pretty big order

423
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,029
sewed up to you to be able to
communicate what the risks look like

424
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:06,570
from that larger viewpoint and from your
technical knowledge in your

425
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,789
understanding of that network
environment

426
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:14,990
and you have to be able to then wonder
where on organization identified

427
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,480
who in their understands in hasn't like
mine they understand what you're doing

428
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,980
and have the same intent

429
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,909
help support your clients your job is to
line your security goals with your

430
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:27,130
organization

431
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,409
not the other way around

432
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,690
remember security investments in your
company compete with all the other

433
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,929
business investment opportunities so
you're up against the guy that wants to

434
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:40,820
do

435
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,428
other types of projects and investments
for the company to make the revenue

436
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:51,179
you over there trying to make sure that
wheels don't fall off well this happens

437
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,990
soul you have to align with the business
and you have to put through

438
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,940
organization goals in concert with what
you're trying to do

439
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,380
however remember your call

440
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,710
you guys understand what kind of
environment to work in

441
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:14,510
you understand what those threats are
and what the obligations are

442
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,240
you're responsible security adviser

443
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,820
I want something looks wrong say it
looks from

444
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,340
may not be popular it may be hard to do
in the face a lot of opposition

445
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,270
but guess what you've got the obligation
to do it

446
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,289
when I work for IBM we were doing

447
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,370
data center outsourcing we were doing
different kinds of communications

448
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,279
outsourcing

449
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,529
support for customers and they ran the
gamut from people that have their own

450
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:45,529
security teams and we just did the arms
and legs work

451
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:48,610
public to the organization that says
okay you got it

452
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,229
you know a report 21 hes daughter during
the company and they have 90 staff at

453
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,990
all

454
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,100
when you do that you start talkin
security that they look at you this

455
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,139
morning steroid

456
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,350
well what should we do I don't think we
ought wanna put expensive there

457
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,689
guess what you have an obligation
because you are the experts

458
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,090
you have the knowledge and you should
know what the minimum standard

459
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,178
Duke areas you haven't obligation to do
that

460
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:15,480
if we let the customer say well I want
to put my stuff online but I don't

461
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,230
really want to put in a virus I really
wanna put web connections on it you know

462
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,270
I want to scan for Boehner abilities
1842

463
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,620
we know better we cannot let that

464
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,610
and so Carter this is you've got a
iphone

465
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,570
a covered all roll your advisor you
telling people what

466
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,870
looks like a threat in your environment
yet you tryna one with the goals of the

467
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,489
company

468
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,799
and say what they're trying to
accomplish your me saying no all the

469
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,408
time but you have to also tell them how
to do it safely

470
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:50,840
you when you get to the point where your
fork in the road that says

471
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,070
we don't wanna do it that way we're
gonna do it anyway

472
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,500
in a very and protected way you have to
have the guts to stand up and say

473
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,690
I can endorse at this is absolutely
going to be

474
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:08,279
a killer if something goes wrong they
may not understand the threat

475
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,840
they may not understand the potential
risk your job is to communicate that

476
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,610
for once the decision is made businesses
gonna go do it

477
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,500
that doesn't mean that you say okay I'll
put my stamp of approval on

478
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,570
it's a politically incorrect thing to do
to dispute

479
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,260
what the business wants to do when you
know that something is very dangerous

480
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,360
and very wrong here for shareholders or
the the value the company

481
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,918
for the security company Sun
uncomfortable position

482
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:40,080
and if you're in the hood Miller
high-level management in the security

483
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,750
environment

484
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:45,580
will be faced with a reality is though
have

485
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,178
so you may have to stand up and say fine
you know

486
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:52,950
I'm said my words and told you what I
think

487
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,380
you have the right to override it that
doesn't mean that I will now change my

488
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,010
story

489
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,760
can tell you it's okay to do it

490
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,899
you have to be the security adviser with
the code of conduct and go to bed

491
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:06,299
excesses

492
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,559
it's dangerous out there out there be
dragons

493
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,129
my solo

494
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,159
you give your best assessment your best
advice based on your knowledge and

495
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,270
skills

496
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,158
in your understanding over at some risk
that your obligation

497
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,590
you help look for different solutions
for different ways of doing things

498
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,629
that mitigate those risks not saying no
figure know how to do it better and

499
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,890
safer

500
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,779
get it down to a reasonable manageable
risk.

501
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:39,350
be ready to defend and support your
recommendations and advice

502
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:44,289
that is a very important obligation
conspirator professionals

503
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:48,379
you are my favorite people in the world
thomas jefferson

504
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:54,409
this quote is just so apt what happens
in the scary world

505
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:57,899
in matters of style you can swim with
the current

506
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:02,059
but in matters of principle must stand
like a rock

507
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:05,510
when it comes to the really important
things that you know

508
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,440
are dangerous or important to stand up
or

509
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,159
you don't bite the bullet and do it

510
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,559
soul what I would say they his

511
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,710
you're gonna see a lot of wonderful
presentations you'll have all

512
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,890
a great said attraction here with
technology information things you can do

513
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,200
you think you can use innovative ways

514
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,890
in creative ways to help you fight
against those dragons and other

515
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,559
that's wonderful as you collect those
pieces of information

516
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,850
share with each other make contact with
each other keep in mind that your goal

517
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,250
is to make sure you know how to apply
that your environment

518
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,440
take the strategic view of how the
supplies in your world

519
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,380
it may be a wonderful product for or
invention or a wonderful way to do

520
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,830
things but it doesn't match up with the
environment

521
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,490
keeping her pocket for later no to me
think individual

522
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,250
the thing that you want to be able to do
though is fine

523
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,700
the ways to improve your environment
protect your assets

524
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,570
help your organization kinda when their
way through that

525
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,019
CEO shark-infested networks today

526
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:16,340
to do what you need to do number will
have to be there

527
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,340
it's not going away

528
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,439
practice your practical scenarios

529
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,570
looking have what may attack your
environment what made you things that

530
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,899
you face

531
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:33,570
ways that you can use technology to help
you

532
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,908
and look at it not only from the
technological side but also from the

533
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:38,610
business approach

534
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:43,100
the most practical and profitable ways
to do the security project is to find a

535
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,590
business benefit at the same time that
you find the security benefit

536
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,279
if you get that you construct your
project that way

537
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,980
you get a win win situation and you
where not only friends

538
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,070
inside organization but credibility for
the next when you come a long way it's

539
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,418
just the dragon

540
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:05,360
so tester positions with your colleagues
and critics

541
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,860
here's your environment to talk with
make contact to network with each other

542
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,389
and bounce ideas off people you don't
have to reinvent the wheel every time

543
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,000
you go out

544
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,140
where people are doing purple concept
Ryan things find what works and what

545
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,929
doesn't

546
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:23,779
share that information because all the
guys are shared

547
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:28,240
they're sharing shamelessly through much
easier tear things down and build a

548
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,360
month

549
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,439
so stick together

550
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,960
go for the invite those grades thank you

551
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,519
do

552
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,519
I don't know if anyone has any questions
or or if you just wanna spot of some

553
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,169
ideas but

554
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:55,169
we may have more time to do that yes or

555
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,910
okay

556
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,149
the question was for this team was for
many companies

557
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,719
that know they even reach and the ones
that know

558
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,799
those two groups right the assumption
there being here in breach

559
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,020
fall I think that's probably pretty true

560
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,960
when you look at the things that have
happened here lately especially with the

561
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,379
stealthy typeof Mauer

562
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:32,819
you probably have at least some work
station someplace new environment that

563
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,750
have garbage room

564
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,899
you may or may not detect it depends on
how well you're monitoring things

565
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:41,489
and it used to be that you'd find those
will

566
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:45,219
things that were infected because they
spew lot of stuff on your network or

567
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,549
they acted funny

568
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,159
can use bob is everyone gone right with
the southeast of its hard to do that

569
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:56,090
we found nowhere in places where he
wakes up and sends a few packets and

570
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,440
shuts down wat Sol wakes up sends a few
packets and guess what I'll

571
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,730
back where i'm talking about. what we
see today

572
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,060
web everything they know your firewalls

573
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,049
their private bank in sports a brothel
think those reportedly

574
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,430
everything's gone through the ones that
you open

575
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,089
why that seizures were getting

576
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:22,070
it's silly for somebody to attack you
someplace

577
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,470
where you know you're protecting so I
think it's probably a truism

578
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:30,509
most people now figure that someplace

579
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,940
somewhere in their environment for
getting infected or get him a problem

580
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,430
and like I said eighty to ninety percent
of the trouble we hid

581
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,890
our users that make no mistakes or for
things we've

582
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,460
implemented there are configured
incorrectly the comeback in bias

583
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,850
it's gonna happen what you need to do is
focus on how you mitigate those things

584
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,160
you should be thinking about incident
response process

585
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,670
things that you can do to isolated
mitigate threats clear my quickly

586
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:02,220
if you need new root cause analysis you
grab some time to do that what times

587
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,959
it's just a matter

588
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,020
fix it fast all 10 things it's really
interesting you know we've got

589
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,490
environments now they're all web based
everything goes for you bro

590
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:19,200
yet people put just about to the cloud
the cloud is an interesting term

591
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,470
the club can any be anything from this
nice little fluffy white thing over here

592
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,330
to those really dark wrangled over there

593
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,610
you have to understand when you go to a
cloud 12

594
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:33,020
what it means with an environment is
what the provider looks like and

595
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,710
I'll just tell you a little side I have
a good colleague good friend

596
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,980
in securing borrow from a pretty big
company Netflix they made the decision

597
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,010
they're going to the cloud they could
not afford to put up infrastructure

598
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:50,630
internally on their own to match their
release biking demands

599
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,760
and it's interesting to think about that
you know further

600
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,180
biggest hit times is right after the
superbowl

601
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,899
evers watch all Super Bowl consumers
that's over wanna go

602
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,260
download a movie you watchin so what
happens

603
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,790
in their environment they're looking out
where their demand curves are

604
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,680
and they know as soon as the Super Bowl
plans they need to pull our servers

605
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,350
online

606
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:16,529
to meet the spike in demand for
downloading and streaming movies

607
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,530
this is a quick and affordable

608
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,690
have that reserve capacity sitting in
our data centers

609
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:27,880
so we went to the cloud and when they
did this oh my god now we're gonna have

610
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,220
to do the operating environment

611
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:35,200
fit they took a very creative approach
they created something called

612
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,629
the chaos monkey what they did is a
maiden agree with their mom their

613
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,410
provider

614
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:46,100
to put up on the mail servers they built
a desk or the internally built their own

615
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,480
to be able to spin up new servers

616
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,280
your 20 minutes ahead of the in the
Super Bowl they're bringing servers on

617
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,010
line 50 117

618
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,210
you know whatever they think in there
watching the demands go

619
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,410
and bringing him up when they do that
they're actually doing an environment

620
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:02,980
where they got

621
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,020
infrastructure cloud and they build
their own images for their servers

622
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,960
so they have two or three standard
images with all the security stuff

623
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,740
built-in

624
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,629
and the spin 'em up with an image well

625
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:21,390
to make sure that the image is there and
that is operating correctly they said we

626
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,990
better know what happens if it breaks
and so they built

627
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:28,529
chaos monkey goes around in Just
arbitrarily knocked down the server

628
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,840
how well do they come back up how well
do they come from C

629
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,350
they practice that scenario something
they gotta do

630
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,480
right so the chaos monkey's gone around
just randomly

631
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,070
bassam server taken a service and
watching it come back up again make sure

632
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,100
that they can recover

633
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,950
said the same thing built what they call
security monkey

634
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,089
it goes around and looks at servers and
said for your configuration Sep 23rd

635
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,260
configurations that right

636
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,800
if it's not they call the chaos monkey
kill anything

637
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,610
bring it up again now

638
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,370
what do we do we go hard for what's
wrong in this thing perfectly

639
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,620
he said we can take the time to do that
knock it down

640
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,140
bring up a fresh from with the loading
reliable

641
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,210
image a creative approach

642
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:19,510
to a very volatile and spiky environment

643
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,510
that lets them manage it the way they
need to manage

644
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,000
do they get broken into him yeah

645
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,080
think things are getting penetrated and
that changes to securing

646
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,420
setting or tries to break into a server
remember the stream in water content

647
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,510
people like to have

648
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,830
the need movies and things they like the
download

649
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,350
to kill start over fresh

650
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:50,990
creative approach to work against the
incident practice the scenario that fits

651
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,390
what you need to be able to do it

652
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,120
and so will you get penetrated will you
have a

653
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,560
a problem will you be infected yeah it's
going to happen it's not

654
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,310
given it went what you gonna do about it

655
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,900
practice figure out what makes sense to
you

656
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,990
what you can operate in that world

657
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:18,919
so that answer questions you use

658
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:25,630
for thanks very much appreciate it have
fun today here

659
