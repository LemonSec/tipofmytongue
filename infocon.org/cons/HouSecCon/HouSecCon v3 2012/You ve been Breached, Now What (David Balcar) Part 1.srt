181
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,760
based out

182
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,080
front row

183
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,960
was this is the essence of the

184
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,570
initiative

185
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,350
it was a good with israel

186
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,170
you're

187
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,740
beads that will be a tax

188
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,390
lost a survey and while

189
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,980
is gets a lot like these

190
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,920
let's face it

191
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,339
it's not for me

192
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,690
it's not real address

193
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,080
it's not mine

194
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,650
ideas forward regarding collins cancels

195
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,110
uh... history

196
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,010
it's all things

197
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,620
basically all day long

198
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,639
most of your are

199
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,140
are

200
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,080
a truly caller

201
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,340
so sounds like

202
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,160
so of course the accident by half

203
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,370
here

204
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,610
myself but

205
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,860
hopes audiences as the sun music u_k_

206
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,670
so regarding their missile the our

207
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,520
always instead

208
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,930
export

209
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,109
well what's interesting instead

210
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:36,390
extraordinary anyway

211
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,319
hampton-el

212
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,320
who's got worth

213
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,560
anonymously ap everything

214
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,619
response

215
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,960

right here indecent

218
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,820
so the inspector general

219
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,090
uh... looked at it

220
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,630
did this for

221
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,840
instead what what what do you know it

222
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,260

230
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,819
it was a so they have a whole surplus of
our driveway

with the way

234
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,130
upheaval

235
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,189

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,940
all problems anymore

237
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,270
so would they have

238
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,920
alternative

239

uh... reacting of

245
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,120
uh... programs

246
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,380
if

247
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,460
it

248
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,510
that problem

249
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,689
uh... stratford otherwise tracker

250
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,310
people

251
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,150

well uh... they stole

258
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,420
it's it's sixty f

259
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,660
credit cards cannot after

260
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,120
almost all set cat

261
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,580
understands that are

262
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,780
it's freezing

263
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,510
apoplectic about these guys

264
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,600
the clinton modeling

265
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,840
k was enough thought

266
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,990
today to watch the tds credit cards

267
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,979
the insurance

268
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:19,430
if you're a price

269
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,689
lurches

270
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,970
all of these guys

271
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,499
and often results emails today call
sheets

272
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:29,590
do you think that

273
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,780
withdraws

274
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,670
so basically i think that the orchestra

275
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,349
exited

276
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,540
well

277
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,770
uh... so alcohol or other rayburn

278
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,770
were forty-five

279
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,620
of us are basically

280
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,750
but if you notice

281
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,190
adopted rooted infected eight hundred
thousand

282
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:04,630
uh...

283
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,890
so hackers are said to be doing

284
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,080
satellites it's easy

285
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,639
it will you secured with the

286
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,330
secure internet access team www

287
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,920
okay a safe and take ten million dollars
to do this

288
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,550
stream

289
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,459
culpability

290
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,430
the partnership is that now

291
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,839
conjures face xvi right now

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,950
c using every five six

294
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,940
you see

295
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,970

296
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,890
yahoo

297
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,680
they hurt myself

298
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,120
designed to extent companies wonderful

299
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,070

300
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,350
idris

301
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,200

567
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,860
information and what's what's the

568
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,260
the problem they were doing

569
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,710
was they were picking certain people
going example showing everything from

570

576
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,959
it already

577
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,080
it was a

578
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,230
right

579
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,960
one-two-three u_s_

cut and that's all right

586
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,550
uh... was not

587
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,810
the reason is because i don't know if

593
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,919
if you buy their status

594
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,700
arctic too personal

595
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,570
making these making instructs all these
