1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:04,790
the internets won't fail me their lives
and how it is

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,059
that's a big stack has a binary creation
with binary of his cage in an increase

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,880
in RC file free and Metasploit

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,670
so I have everything set up for ya are
your views on the RC script and also

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,790
that year was never

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,160
and just for a quick I just wanna show
you how well

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,490
what we do to bypass so you'll see here
my big dumb

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,889
machine right here is fully patched
windows 7

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,970
Mac the status is ok address is OK

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,300
I'm not picking on McAfee it's what I
got this is SMS

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,519
this is Mike Corder nvm and I want to
show you that

12
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:39,579
this little he's a shell script right
here

13
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,600
I don't know who and here's a who in
years actually a coder but this little

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,079
piece a shell script right here is all I
used to bypass the same me

15
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,510
so basically I create a payload I come
down here now set out some bad

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,818
characters

17
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,489
then we come down here and do a little
bit more said magic

18
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:01,190
we do a little bit a randomization at
the bites in here we break it apart and

19
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,369
some see files

20
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:05,690
and then we come back down here and we
compile it back into an EXE

21
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,399
and that's it I mean this is like God 31
zip code that i'm gonna bypass McAfee's

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,220
abus

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,250
and thats like I said that's within nasa
be exact hi

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,300
so the come over here to our listener we
do Metasploit

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,399
once again this is not revolutionary
were basically is startin to handle our

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,500
HTTPS a trillion and we school
everything to

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,290
because the first customer wants to see
what's up so with that outs also see why

28
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:33,650
a

29
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,910
for you de I'm

30
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,149
by so we get that going

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,580
takes a second Metasploit rocks but
it'll slow

32
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:52,270
we think of skepticism

33
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,360
but lol a way

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,100
so you can see over here let's start now
we have our webmail over here in our

35
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,369
Google templates

36
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,830
got ready to go are Go Daddy templates

37
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,619
the only bad part about Go Daddy is that
you can only do 75 yr so emails at a

38
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,570
time I think science common knowing

39
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,450
and you have to go through a capture
every time so what we do see you is so

40
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,329
when we send this in the to line of
course with when I have put ourselves

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,620
we just felt like employees at whatever
company dot com

42
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,210
we know that's gonna get it back that's
fine is only certain people can send to

43
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,570
the entire organization

44
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,530
but again it's that level of trust me
look and say oh we're not always cuz we

45
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,970
we've got everything in BCC so one other
tips and tricks to make this easy if

46
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,609
you've got a hundred emails

47
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,630
I'm Go Daddy doesn't parse it

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,730
when you put it in there but if you can
copy and pasted into Gmail

49
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,489
it automatically separated out based on
spaces

50
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,060
and nakama so it's it's much easier to
copy pasted in there

51
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,350
so we're gonna send that email and I'm
actually said that to Mac you gonna

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,060
dress

53
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,310
cuz we got protection right up

54
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,110
or maybe not address I'll that went
through our

55
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,110
Glanville 2013 my company spam filter
whatever we got and a

56
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,560
because it's what you reverse DNS work
right so

57
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,680
anyway so here's our email Alex will
generate

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,060
will check over here make sure your
honor at the bottom so we got the footer

59
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,930
see the thing is is that is little stuff
like this when people see this

60
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,690
you don't like if you have the little
recycled thing you're no digital trees

61
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,650
were harmed in this email or

62
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,280
whatever like people see that and
they're like 0 it's legit it came from

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,090
my company i

64
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,540
and you're mentioning that you can't
have any unauthorized use of the isley

65
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,359
this is not an authorized to use it as
to be legitimate

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,970
I once again see you click on the link
and it doesn't matter that the link is

67
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,230
completely wrong

68
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,820
it matters that domain and though party
comes up when you hover over it are the

69
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,440
same

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,300
I know it sounds stupid but that's like
wanna you know what we look for

71
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,750
yeah I think I like years in a row that
some users are trying to look at right

72
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,010
see where the league actually goes
alright so let's check it out we're

73
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,140
hoping this works

74
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,799
so this is cool what we got of course

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,990
am were using II you set the car on the
side

76
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,450
that I did some I'm some changes with an
N

77
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,839
and its get up off the job outlet sir

78
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,209
hopefully Tomah my advisor to all this
love

79
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,810
that still thinking about Selena Java
but what we do is

80
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,250
I sorted out a guy so here we go so and
look it's a safe

81
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,690
really big and bold so again we're still
working to go

82
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,770
or verify see our company where
publisher LLC that sounds legit right

83
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,640
no anybody can buy can register a
company called

84
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,039
anything they want to and one thing you
can say is that always trust content

85
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,140
from this publisher lease on the screen

86
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,680
it looks like it's not check but it is
be another thing about these digitally

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,729
signed other athletes

88
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,390
is out lots of directly check is
automatically check for some reason and

89
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,159
ie9

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,940
I'm also on ie9 by the way humbling
patch 107

91
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,979
not mention that be with McAfee the
whole nine yards I got it all

92
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,050
and so like eric said those boxes
AutoCheck for some reason it's not

93
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,320
showing up in here whatever bye and what
school do is like if Martin click Cancel

94
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,740
it doesn't matter because I said a
repeater so seven seconds later off of

95
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,050
backup and resuming at seven seconds
another medium of

96
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,570
is fun we're doing credential harvesting
to

97
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,669
so does give them some time to enter the
username and password

98
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,690
I'm and you know that's at least to
start for us

99
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,320
right but it'll keep popping up in
popping up until either click

100
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,020
run or are able to click that login
button and

101
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,530
and get to the next page so we basically
all this we have three attack factors

102
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,609
that have led

103
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,940
the login credentials and if all else
fails

104
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,360
we actually get emails back sometimes I
can login to the site

105
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,610
were like I'll call that you click the
trouble logging embodiments run helpdesk

106
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,250
EXE and then I can help you and they're
like okay

107
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,760
and so there's three attack vectors you
can even add more you can make it go to

108
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,240
a PDF to Word document whatever you want
to but you know

109
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,500
for to have the actual security report
but for the sake of this we just in

110
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,419
those three so

111
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:07,630
a mic like a run has its verified an
hour over here

112
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,330
I have my show cell

113
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,000
for now we have our shelter in India sis

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,370
Heights OH

115
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,000
here's some things to consider a ride

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,729
we just killed the cat by the last
chance just for you guys benefit

117
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:30,090
email attachments do you know the sender
I know that this gets hard on it hard on

118
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,440
and use our education but this is what
we're talking about we have been talking

119
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,960
about

120
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,530
don't open an attachment on the email
you don't know for like

121
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,280
since email was invented about me know
it because it's all verified

122
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,948
what the hell was that thing is that if
you make it look legit will still do it

123
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:51,430
you know so so that leads me to believe
that user education is not working right

124
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,360
it's not working it's not a good place
to spend our money don't put all your

125
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,479
chips on users

126
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,380
any information being an ass for you say
attack you or your company

127
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,340
you know i mean these are simple things
is the link suspicions raised in a black

128
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,590
tights your security would never ask an
associate for the password these are the

129
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,739
things we talk about in use our
education and these are the things that

130
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,880
users are not paying attention to you

131
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,030
unfortunately cell

132
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,080
you wanna talk about the expo all that
so many in exposure as

133
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,180
his is the biggest thing it's not all
it's not if the attacks gonna happen

134
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,020
it's when the attacks gonna happen right

135
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,710
and so if we can't do anything about our
users clicking on the links right

136
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,780
can't do anything about that so what's
the next thing that we can do

137
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,799
we can mitigate what happens during the
attack right

138
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,139
cell we can mitigate how far

139
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,199
the people can get once they're in the
network we can mitigate

140
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,199
I white white type cells I business
units are network segments

141
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,639
segment of so except talk about that on
the next line but the number one thing

142
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,710
I know this is totally stupid but it %uh

143
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,090
day you know most security people like
us when we find Boehner abilities were

144
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,609
do what's called responsible disclosure
which is

145
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,280
when and the Dove easier day is found
you contact is

146
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,020
Adobe and you're like hey I found a bug
in your code here's

147
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,159
you know that that the research I'm
gonna give you six weeks to fix this

148
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,810
before %uh publicly release

149
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,960
so that generally as what happens if you
get slapped with a cease and desist have

150
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,870
cars &

151
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,699
well there is that but but so the main
thing is to keep yourself updated

152
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,490
I need updating my nose against and then
I like to skip it all the time like but

153
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,520
unfortunately

154
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,680
that's how it works thanks for some
other stuff out an update so the more

155
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,349
you can update yourself the better

156
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:38,349
I know it sounds silly but it's true
okay so

157
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,550
as markets are talking about limiting
exposure right so I'm

158
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,959
the on the user awareness basically
we've got his awareness at the bottom

159
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:46,250
but

160
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,329
think about their I've got 10,000 emails
I harvested

161
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:55,150
I know they're legit I'm gonna send you
this email at least one person if not

162
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,290
more after that

163
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,180
unless is gonna click on that link so
and

164
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,839
if you think about it before we got the
show how many layers a

165
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,240
love checks and balances does that show

166
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,890
go through before it actually gets to
you right the user click on the link

167
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,350
again accidentals yeah that's bad but so
what

168
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,440
you got it be responsible for securing
your network

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,020
and it you're not looking at these
different layers

170
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,120
like everything about the user clicks
the link person is AV

171
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,510
today the catch it now DMSP host-based
IPS

172
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,209
that catcher no do you have a network
base I D S IPS did that catch it no

173
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:35,279
DNA your soldier in Iraq get it now do
you have a bunch a blinky light systems

174
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:35,650
today

175
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,880
catch it now so basically what you're
looking at is

176
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,600
limiting the exposure within the
organization once this happens

177
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,630
enough so that you can actually find out
what happened

178
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,920
prevent them from getting to the gets
like at the wall

179
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,349
when the secret sauce or whatever it is
that whatever trade secrets you're

180
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,339
looking to protect

181
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,470
and you can do this by

182
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,180
basically an looking at things like
network segmentation

183
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,349
right I don't know how many times I've
been on a pen test where I get on one

184
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,459
box and i cant see all the boxes
throughout the world like

185
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:09,819
there's no segmentation totally flat
network well that's good allow the

186
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,310
attacker once we get on that one box to
display it out we know that if we get

187
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,449
one said a credentials

188
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:18,800
en route 1 box all the dollars are gonna
fall sometimes as fast sometimes slow

189
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,380
and see it doesn't make sense if you
think about a business units you know

190
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,589
you have an HR department Alan R on the
HR department sorry

191
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:29,610
but so get an HR department what do you
really need to do you

192
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,339
you know all they need to do is get out
to the Internet there's probably one or

193
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:36,270
two internal applications that they used
a gander

194
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,560
employee information or whatever and
need to contact Active Directory to be a

195
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,859
long and they really need to do anything
besides that no

196
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,680
so why dome we as companies segment that
business unit all

197
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,459
way over here see because their job is
not secure although

198
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:56,969
user education is also minutes like the
Nirvana security if we can just get all

199
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,209
our users to hold hands and be on the
same page everything in the great but

200
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:01,630
that's not the way it's gonna happen

201
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,050
and so it's not their job their job is
to hire people

202
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,160
their job is not security thats our job
so we

203
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,469
have to think of ways that we can

204
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,069
she's them doing their job and

205
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:18,349
them for not getting attacked like this
and so like I said

206
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,310
network segmentation is our biggest one
um we don't see enough

207
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,390
yeah a lot times there's not really a
proper redress filter in place

208
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,589
I'm sanitizing antivirus implementations
sometimes it's good sometimes that's bad

209
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,339
and it kills me to say this but I can

210
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,390
honestly tell you guys that at the
biggest thorn in our side

211
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,380
is Microsoft Security Essentials for
home users and forefront for business

212
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,900
I hate saying there but our theory is
that Microsoft has access to the source

213
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,459
codes they can you actually checks and
balances

214
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,540
of course we do have ways of getting
around that but that's definitely the

215
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,430
biggest on in

216
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,620
thorn in our side we r he's paid tools
actually

217
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,949
bypass their AV you are you buying their
packet inspection if something's going

218
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:01,880
on for 43 is it really

219
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,760
on the right track that should be going
out on that for I you know can you

220
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,589
are using some where you can actually
get in the middle that communicate in

221
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,260
some way to blue coat or something

222
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,040
that's going to analyze as packets and
two-factor authentication

223
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,150
I don't know how many times and I if you
guys wanna raise your hands go ahead

224
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,680
but I'm OWA outs outside on the internet
without you factors and occasionally

225
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,479
companies have that

226
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,709
I so wanna yeah no takers on this by

227
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:32,140
might like you're saying we harvest the
credentials been around and i wana we've

228
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,240
got a script that dumps the rest the
less from the Global Address Book and

229
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,250
now we just

230
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,640
I you know we can build another campaign
at that point in time

231
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,699
I'm you know there's all kinds of ways
to get around

232
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:47,329
everything that's there so you have to
really think as an attacker do you have

233
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:49,510
user awareness on that list but you'll
notice is that

234
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,560
Obama because there is something to be
said for user awareness

235
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,880
it's just that are we spending half a
bar security budget on user awareness

236
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,250
we are its own work back so someone at
all operate

237
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,300
user awareness not be the gold any
social engineering testing

238
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,969
I and one thing that we didn't talk
about what social engineering

239
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,500
is the number one most political test
your ever do as a pen tester

240
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,800
because human nature amongst all of us
is completely different

241
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,969
we constantly do people who have been in
the industry for nineteen years and this

242
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,060
and that I've done I've done it all

243
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,530
they don't take it very well when they
get fixed in the fall for

244
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,660
effect we recently had an engagement
where they just it was out for a couple

245
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,860
hours

246
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,800
and we're able to fish a buncha people
and phone they made us take the site

247
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,630
down immediately they tried to sue us
for use their low

248
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,810
it was made as transfer the domain to
them money-making can be

249
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,770
can be there but the reason is that you
gotta see lovers and they got phished

250
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,770
you know and I don't like it and so
those are the people that are increasing

251
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,220
the security of your organization you
know they're impeding because they got

252
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,650
embarrassed and

253
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,010
they don't care about fixing whatever
happened they just care about covering

254
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:58,470
up

255
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,589
so we can say to you if you are gonna be
involved in this from a vantage point of

256
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:05,430
view or if you were involved in this as
a director

257
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,329
pitching it to your organization get by
and as high up

258
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:13,930
within your organization as you can
because people I'm sure do get fired

259
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,839
over stuff like this I people definitely
get in trouble

260
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,579
and you know and did the testing should
encompass

261
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:24,589
all aspects a defense like we're talking
about I'm

262
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:28,430
it's not just the user's you wanna see
your spending all this money there

263
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,329
to put all these things in place and
have this stack you know where's your is

264
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,959
your money being said spam properly
right ensure them

265
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,000
that money that your budgeting for or
spending already within the organization

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,420
is going to the right place

267
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,140
if you do you of Bowl fish with Mauer
and everything like we just showed you

268
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,589
I'm you're gonna know here's where got
hot here so I can get

269
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,220
car you know or I spent a million
dollars on this new blinky light thing

270
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,630
and it actually work you know how are
you actually gonna know that the money

271
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,459
that you're investing in your defense is
gonna work unless you test

272
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:02,209
right and that's a a huge task that
we're up against as protesters all the

273
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:07,008
time

274
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:10,420
I mean absolutely we can we can do that
and we have done that in several

275
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,329
companies

276
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:14,959
%uh the question was can you do that
without affairs in the user's

277
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,170
meaning can we just come in an
organization and set this up

278
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,618
specifically and test all the outbound
defenses and yes absolutely we can

279
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:27,109
and we have done that several times and
what are the keys here that I like to

280
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:27,730
say and

281
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,679
and they'll pry kill me and my work but
don't let that company that installed

282
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,230
the stuff tested you know get somebody
else to test

283
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,470
cuz cuz get or at least another group
you know i mean i I

284
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,049
anyway so I so so yes we can absolutely
do that in a sticky situation for sure

285
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:50,049
questions

286
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:55,079
contact info I'm is pure a number of
attacks on the twitters

287
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,258
and anybody's guess so

288
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,480
you any where you've been here access

289
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,109
whatever testing view if that's very
rare

290
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:11,549
you just so heavy rains information
where you

291
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:15,309
go game um

292
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:19,499
no one saying I just now six what sort
of depends because

293
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:22,759
there some there some different facets
of everything

294
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:26,410
you know what I mean because what we
found is that every single companies

295
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,469
version of

296
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,589
you know the whole usually is a little
bit different yes

297
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,309
sell for example if they allow this type
of attack the email attack we always get

298
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:36,850
enough we've never had it not fail

299
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,309
if they allow physical pan or her social
engineering

300
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:43,449
almost always getting um cell

301
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:48,179
so it basically just depends but but if
it's just limiting us to it you know an

302
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,459
external link gauge man with no

303
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,529
social engineering then there several
times we having on him for sure

304
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,189
we've had one company tell me and Martin
do whatever and I'm

305
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:01,610
guarantee will probably never be invited
back to that organization has

306
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,689
we we get whatever we have courts within
that

307
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:10,139
that defining a Sao but I said we want
the whole enchilada and we told them in

308
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:12,979
fact one of the things that we did
during the engagement was

309
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,279
I'm it was a physical threat to break in
the building to do so

310
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,309
once we got an and we did this entire

311
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:23,449
spearfishing scenario internally so they
had to open now rely so if you guys want

312
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:24,760
scanners and you see that there's an

313
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,019
open mail really and it's a medium
that's bullshit it's a credit

314
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:32,639
because someone who gets in that door
and hit send emails out as anybody

315
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:35,320
within the organization that have any
authentication

316
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,250
abbe so you can do this entire scenario
internally and the reason the trust

317
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,529
level on that is so high

318
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:43,710
is all I have to do is renamed my
computer to secure

319
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,389
and the DNS takes care of the rest if
they look at me I'm on an internal IP

320
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:49,168
address

321
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,750
I'm it also gives you the ability to
clone internal for all sites which began

322
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,000
with super legit

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,039
I at that one site that we talked about
where they said go ahead and do whatever

324
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,220
I'm basically we set this %ah and let it
fly

325
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,789
and within five minutes they asked us to
take the site down over 300 users log

326
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:13,789
and that was with financial scenario any
other questions from the group thank you

327
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,428
guys very much because I'm thinking
about

328
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,519
yes sir man in the middle

329
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,139

330
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,629
