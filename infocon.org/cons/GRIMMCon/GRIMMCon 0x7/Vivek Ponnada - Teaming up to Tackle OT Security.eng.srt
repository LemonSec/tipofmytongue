well I'm giving you a presenter control

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,900
here

10
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,680
so

11
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,420
um so the vacuum's got quite a

12
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,360
background I've I mean OT and PLC

13
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,020
security coding practices S4 I mean I

14
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,060
recognize a lot of these things but 14

15
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,320
countries

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,360
and

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,600
board members and like you've got quite

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,759
a lot to uh quite a lot of experience to

19
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,960
draw from here

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,259
uh how did you get started

21
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,439
I came from the ICS space right I was a

22
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,740
controls technician many years ago and

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,479
then eventually became a field service

24
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,660
engineer in the ICS space and

25
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,660
after I um finished my business school I

26
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,340
actually took a break from from field

27
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,599
service work right I went back to

28
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,400
business school and then GE had me back

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,099
as a sales guy they said uh hey you know

30
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,780
this stuff why don't you open this to

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,860
customers that this is the right

32
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,560
solution right I enjoyed it and then I

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,660
was selling controls upgrades to power

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,300
plants not only gas installations and

35
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,920
that portfolio included cyber security

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,379
and then I naturally gravitated towards

37
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,080
it because it seemed like the next big

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,640
thing and you know there was so much

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,260
excitement

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,300
um and only after you go deep in that

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,879
you realize things move so slowly in the

42
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,340
OT space right so the adoption That was

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,379
supposed to take off year after year

44
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,000
like every year is like this is the Year

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,819
this is when it'll take off it finally

46
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,620
did happen I think last couple years ago

47
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,060
did actually

48
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,760
um uh happen probably a decade later but

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,980
it's now it's here right so yeah my

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,040
startup was from the ICS space

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
excellent wow hold on a second I'm I'm

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
blinded by that shirt Brian show me the

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,860

55
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,940

conferences I went to in the security

67
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,420
space so yeah I'm pretty sure I'll land

68
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,480
this one I don't know and I feel happy

69

proud of the fact that you still fit in

70
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,080

102
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,000

all uh definitely uh the enjoyed that

107
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,199
part right where I was given a mentor

108
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
kind of walked me through um

109
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,100
you know what to expect and how to

110
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,720

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,680

from one track to the other right so

117
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,060
thank you to spending the next 45

118
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,580
minutes yeah thank you folks

119
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,699
all right so uh my talk today is about

120
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,240
teaming up to tackle OT security so what

121
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,520
I realized in the past few years is that

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,520
we talk a lot about prospers and

123
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,600
Technologies products and

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,240
framework standards but very often we

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
missed the people part right so that's

126
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,120
what I want to focus on today

127
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,520
but uh before we get into the detail a

128
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,259
little bit about myself

129
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,900
um we make panada I work for a company

130
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,020
called the zombie network sets in the OT

131
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,940
visibility and security space my

132
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,740
LinkedIn contact information and then

133
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,860
Twitter info as well I'm reachable um on

134
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,100
either of them and my email as well I

135
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,539
want to share a little bit of my journey

136
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,699
because I think uh Matthew were asking

137
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,440
the question about you know where it

138
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,020
came from and and some of that hopefully

139
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,780
is useful right so I came from the ICS

140
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,580
background all my life I've been a

141
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,919
controls and instrumentation person and

142
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,479
for the past eight and a half years or

143
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,000
so I've been doing OT cyber security and

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,380
soon to be nine

145
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,680
and uh my background is engineering I

146
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,060
have a business school you know from UT

147
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,520
Austin welcome homes you know MBA from

148
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,400
UT Austin School of Business I also have

149
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,880
a industrial cert from uh from Sands and

150
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,819
you'll see that constant narrative in my

151
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,160
life is I try to be technical as well as

152
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,720
you know the strategy and Commercial

153
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,900
person that I have my daily role and my

154
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,840
day job for and previously I was a field

155
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,300
engineer business develop manager

156
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,419
director of ICS security but back in the

157
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,620
day I started as a controls and

158
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,259
instrumentation technician and I had

159
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,060
worked in 14 countries and the reason I

160
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,979
put it here is that I'm hoping some of

161
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,319
you that are traditional I.T or

162
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,419
traditional I.T security people I hope

163
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,060
you consider this wonderful

164
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,340
OT space right you get to travel the

165
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,560
world I mean I I think you will do that

166
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,740
in other divisions other roles as well

167
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,960
but not as much as you would in our

168
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
world because critical infrastructure is

169
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,759
very global oh I mean there are Regional

170
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,759
issues there are Regional

171
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,259
important things that you consider but

172
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,940
you really get an opportunity to travel

173
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,680
the world so that's why I put it over

174
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,360
there and then you get to collaborate

175
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,639
with people again around the world and

176
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,919
the colleague for the top 20 secure PLC

177
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,620
coding practices project we have about a

178
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,900
thousand people sign up for it and we

179
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,759
have monthly call where you you have

180
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,280
people from Germany from

181
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,280
you know Eastern Europe from from Africa

182
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,379
from all across North America you know

183
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,419
you get to talk to these people experts

184
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,520
from around the world and you realize

185
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,560
how closely or tightened of a community

186
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,360
that is and you get to learn from each

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,460
other right and I'm based here in

188
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,039
Vancouver and Canada in BC and I'm also

189
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,960
part of the the Mars the mainland

190
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,700
Advanced research Society that's the

191
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,320
name of the group that handles the

192
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,000
besides Vancouver you know we have a

193
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,880
dc-604 forum also a social Gathering

194
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,599
called Vancity Sac for security right so

195
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,700
also a member of Isa which you know

196
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,200
automation controls Engineers are

197
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,240
typically are and then a member and

198
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,040
volunteer for isaka

199
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,600
so

200
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,740
Paul

201
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,779
um my title for this slide is Rome

202
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,300
wasn't built in a day and many of you

203
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,420
would recognize this Purdue model right

204
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,220
what do you see on this Purdue model is

205
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,200
you know you see this level zero sensors

206
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,380
and Level One controllers so on and so

207
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,420
forth

208
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,459
and this is a theoretical model right

209
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,740
but this is what most it and I.T

210
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,019
security people would hope to see from

211
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,779
an OT security

212
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:21,019
implementation right this is what Isa

213
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,360
62443 wants you to eventually get to the

214
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,839
Zone conduit model or people talk about

215
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,220
you know applying different security

216
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,680
controls for different zones and that's

217
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
why you need to segment things this way

218
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,060
but the reality is

219
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,160
it's never this way

220
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,839
um historically it's not been this way

221
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,300
and more importantly the missing piece

222
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,880
on this diagram actually is the people

223
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,820
right you never get to see who is behind

224
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,459
this like how do you get to this like

225
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,560
what does it take like what kind of

226
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,980
resources what kind of people skill sets

227
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,660
are we talking about like who's actually

228
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,459
doing the stuff that's always missing

229
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,899
right

230
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,220
so

231
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,500
the next segment is who are these OT

232
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,980
people so who is behind this whatever

233
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,079
level zero level one this whole Purdue

234
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,019
architecture right first off is the

235
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,180
maintenance personnel and then within

236
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,500
that maintenance Personnel we have

237
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,540
mechanical electrical controls and

238
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,579
instrumentation people right so the

239
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,140
mechanical people would be those people

240
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,899
that so these sensors and actuators are

241
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,120
on physical equipment right palms and

242
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,160
turbines and valves and things like that

243
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,560
right so the mechanical people are those

244
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,140
that are maintaining them

245
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,880
um taking care of them if they're you

246
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,700
know broken or fixing them on a timely

247
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,079
basis right preventive maintenance

248
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,360
things like that mechanical people

249
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,220
handle mechanical stuff naturally you

250
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,980
know flanges to turbines to whatever

251
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,899
mechanical maintenance needs to happen

252
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,360
the electrical people are on the

253
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,700
drive-in typically the motors right the

254
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,399
generators the switch gear anything that

255
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,399
has to do with obviously electrical

256
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,160
stuff usually you know higher voltages

257
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,560
that train they're certified and they

258
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,779
handle the electrical stuff that's again

259
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,660
tied to you know these sensors and

260
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,700
actuators being on those things right

261
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,940
and then finally for the security piece

262
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,380
the most important piece of the puzzle

263
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,240
are these controls and instrumentation

264
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,399
people and within them we have

265
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,380
technicians and then we have Engineers

266
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,380
the technicians are those that are you

267
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,260
know replacing these sensors

268
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,180
fixing you know broken sensors or

269
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,640
transmitters

270
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,959
calibrating transmitters calibrating

271
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,180
actuators so things that are at this

272
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,399
level zero those technicians are the

273
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,220
ones doing it right they might also be

274
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,579
replacing i o modules or anything that's

275
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,680
kind of you know Blinky lights but

276
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,959
usually it's the engineers controls

277
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,940
Engineers ICS Engineers that are

278
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,680
programming and working at this level

279
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,000
one so plc's distributed Control Systems

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,440
the Inc engineer is the one that's

281
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,420
responsible for it similarly at this

282
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,100
level too you know if an operator need

283
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,740
it's a new alarm your alert it's the

284
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,440
engineer that's configuring it or if the

285
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,060
process change and some variables need

286
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,820
to be you know updated it's the controls

287
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,860
and automation engineer that's doing it

288
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,959
so the controls and automation engineers

289
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,420
and the technicians collectively are

290
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,540
behind this especially from a directly

291
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,880
Purdue mapping point of view

292
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,500
and then there are these operations

293
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,200
Personnel these are also called

294
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,839
production or process people and again

295
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,339
we have two segments there the field

296
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,320
operators will be those people that are

297
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,019
walking around maybe starting stopping

298
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,120
pumps either manually there or you know

299
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,240
using these hmis these human machine

300
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,399
interfaces to start stop the process

301
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,100
right to make it running and then the

302
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,660
shift to Engineers for the supervisors

303
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,820
that are um

304
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,040
in charge of it right so maybe they have

305
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,180
this responsibility for the whole

306
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,380
process and they have a bunch of

307
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,700
operators that work for them or report

308
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,820
for them and then keep in mind most of

309
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,440
the critical infrastructure especially

310
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,779
Empower oil and gas

311
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,040
um that normally would think is pretty

312
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,079
infrastructure energy right these things

313
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,680
operate 24 7. um so they might have two

314
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,839
12-hour shifts or maybe three eight hour

315
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,240
shifts but there's always someone in

316
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,980
charge of the process

317
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,899
now there are also many others right

318
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,399
many other people responsible for

319
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,160
reliability performance safety so you

320
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,779
see for example in this Purdue model

321
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,399
picture the site production control

322
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,740
system so maybe the liability people the

323
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,959
performance people have an interface

324
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,300
maybe they're connected to billing and

325
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,100
optimization and things like that so

326
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,959
there are many more people and of course

327
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,639
the managers right the plant manager the

328
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,860
maintenance manager operation manager

329
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,740
all these are about one on layer on top

330
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,420
of these engineers

331
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,920
but

332
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,199
let's talk about the extended landscape

333
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,240
as in what are all these people right

334
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,540
people behind this ICS and OT space what

335
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,160
are they like seeing on a day-to-day

336
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,180
basis

337
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,060
let's start off historical issues right

338
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,339
no proper asset inventory visibility

339
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,079
because historically they were

340
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,959
maintained in visual diagrams or PDFs so

341
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,000
and then you build over time right so

342
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,519
you bought a system 30 years ago and

343
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,560
replaced some components 20 years ago

344
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,899
and updated me with the HMR the

345
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,779
interface 10 years ago and more with

346
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,880
recently something you know was faulty

347
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,339
so he replaced five years ago and

348
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,980
there's no record of any of this so you

349
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,959
kind of know from pictures in fact the

350
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,360
picture that you have the PDF or the

351
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,100
drawing or whatever that you have is 30

352
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,600
years old because that's when it was

353
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,579
installed since then you might have some

354
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,139
red markings on it if something got

355
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,880
updated but really there's no tracking

356
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,220
right historically no you might have a

357
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,839
spreadsheet these days because somebody

358
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,000
asked you to put together something

359
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,680
and then security is not being a key

360
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,600
requirement in my previous talks I

361
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,060
mentioned that to safety and reliability

362
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,519
were key important things but not

363
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,380
security because 30 years ago that

364
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,180
wasn't an important deal to work with

365
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,160
for the industrial controls people

366
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,899
so what ended up being is you know we

367
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,120
still have obsolete systems that were

368
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,579
not upgraded and then insecure protocols

369
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,980
that are in use because you know years

370
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,320
ago that's what they got and they still

371
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
are having to use it it's not that they

372
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,579
want to you know be insecure they want

373
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,260
to use absolute equipment but that's

374
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,540
what they have and then if something

375
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,639
were to be changed or upgraded or

376
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,440
replaced they have limited outage

377
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,600
windows so they can Refinery for example

378
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,660
it's operating 24 7 and every few years

379
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,259
usually six seven eight years

380
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:32,820
um every eight years they have an outage

381
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,279
window right sometimes a decade and they

382
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,279
can stop it for 30 days 50 days usually

383
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,920
50 60 days we have to accomplish a lot

384
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,240
of things in those days and everything

385
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,940
has to work smoothly and then not stop

386
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,620
for the next 10 years I mean just

387
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,180
imagine something like that critical

388
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,220
infrastructure sometimes you have

389
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,139
equipment that's running for 10 years

390
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,959
and you know you have to move bits and

391
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,220
pieces while things are running but

392
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,899
otherwise for the most part the whole

393
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,180
plant is never going to be down for

394
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,060
another 10 years

395
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,560
management support right so difficulties

396
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,139
and risk evaluation because of all these

397
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,360
things about lack of resources lack of

398
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,100
you know knowledge about you know okay

399
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,560
security or uh difficulties in

400
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,019
accomplishing these things right uh

401
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,459
management finds it difficult to

402
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,620
evaluate the risk properly because if

403
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,300
you don't have good asset inventory or

404
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,980
visibility

405
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,420
um you know how can the controls

406
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,899
Engineers say this is X risks x amount

407
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,220
of risk right it's difficult to

408
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,920
calculate not knowing what you have and

409
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,420
even if you want to calculate there's

410
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,459
not enough data to say you know I have

411
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,740
this level of reliability

412
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,420
um so I'll absolutely expect something

413
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,600
to you know fail you have reliability

414
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,160
calculations you have performance

415
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,199
calculations but not related to cyber

416
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,600
security at nit world everything is

417
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,420
connected so I assume preach right so

418
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,860
you assume that the likelihood of breach

419
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,860
is 100 not that easy in the OT world

420
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,420
because there are so many layers it's

421
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,040
defense and depth

422
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,199
um to get to an asset and to you know

423
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,559
reliability we make it work bad right to

424
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,260
really make have an attack it's not

425
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,000
always that straightforward so it's very

426
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,740
difficult for management to value that

427
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,900
risk for for multiple

428
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,119
um multiple reasons and then accordingly

429
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,220
planning for resources funding it's

430
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,380
pretty difficult as well because you

431
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,640
haven't the value of the risk

432
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,919
appropriately so it's hard to plan for

433
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,900
resources or funding

434
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,760
on top of that you have regulation

435
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,419
that's kind of haphazard so we have

436
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:32,880
often prescriptive uh not risk-based

437
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,860
regulation you know usually people tend

438
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,600
to blame nerkship for that in the power

439
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,059
segment they have evolved they are

440
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,679
trying to make it more risk-based but

441
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,000
historically it was very prescriptive

442
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,460
and interestingly the new TSA directives

443
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,200
that came after last year's Colonial

444
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,240
pipeline incident they also are very

445
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,799
prescriptive you know do MFA zero trust

446
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,720
a lot of patching requirements many

447
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,760
things that are not only difficult to

448
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,919
implement in the OT space but don't

449
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,500
always lead to risk reduction they seem

450
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,260
to be good I.T best practices but they

451
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,120
don't translate well into OT best

452
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,460
practices and in other talks prior I

453
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,620
talked about it so here I want to focus

454
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,840
on what these challenges are in terms of

455
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,120
people getting these messages and then

456
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
you know struggling to figure out how to

457
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,080
implement them and how to make it work

458
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,660
for the daily daily lives right

459
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,340
and then in many regular many

460
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,320
infrastructure verticals uh the

461
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,720
regulation is non-existent so it's you

462
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,520
know in in some ways it's better because

463
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,960
you can actually start on a security

464
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,660
Journey without being uh bottlenecked by

465
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,299
regulation but in other cases you know

466
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:37,860
it's very easy to say we don't have to

467
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,740
do that right so why fund something when

468
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,240
you don't have to do it right so that's

469
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
another problem

470
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,080
and then long project cycles and

471
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
non-aligned incentives so most new

472
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,360
projects take years right and a nuclear

473
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,580
plant might take 20 years to develop

474
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,799
maybe other projects made you know two

475
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,500
to ten years uh LNG a liquify natural

476
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,000
gas for example I've seen them

477
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,100
consistently take 10 to 12 years you

478
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,440
know from initial request to planning to

479
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,780
Fork approvals to ordering equipment

480
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,539
installing to you know first shipment it

481
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,640
might take 10 to 12 years so whatever

482
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,980
decisions you made 10 12 years ago

483
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,440
should still hold true which is unusual

484
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,940
right in the IT world you don't make

485
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,700
decisions for 10 12 years you hardly

486
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,140
ever keep anything around for three

487
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,240
years you're constantly buying new tools

488
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
construction and engineering companies

489
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,720
not paying the asset owners that's

490
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,160
another challenge right so somebody

491
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,320
builds it and then someone else runs it

492
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,660
for the next 20 or 30 years so the

493
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,520
company that made the decisions about

494
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,799
what's good even in their best interest

495
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,740
right um it's very hard for them to take

496
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,900
someone else's best interest about oh

497
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,660
let's make this extra fifty thousand

498
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,160
dollar investment because that's going

499
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,720
to be good for the next 30 Years versus

500
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
let's cut this fifty thousand dollars

501
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,559
it's not our responsibility let someone

502
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,080
else uh handle it and that someone else

503
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,240
probably will now need to invest a

504
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,740
million dollars to get to the same

505
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,600
result because it wasn't thought about

506
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,880
an initial design and then upgrades

507
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
being capex driven

508
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,380
this is also again a historical thing in

509
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,659
the I.T world we have operating budgets

510
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,400
that uh and are based on you know

511
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,140
three-year leases for example we

512
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,120
constantly change Hardware I would

513
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,460
constantly buy new tools we are happy to

514
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,799
subscribe on a yearly basis

515
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,799
um because we're all Opex driven right

516
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
in this world in the OT World things are

517
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,659
capex driven so how do you get security

518
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,539
budget when you never I plan for it on a

519
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,640
yearly basis you bought something 12

520
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,100
years ago 20 years ago and that's going

521
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,020
to be with you for the next X number of

522
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,919
years

523
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,620
and then these are more esoteric rights

524
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,360
or public good versus private cost of

525
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,780
security so commonly for it companies uh

526
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,059
banking or you know even regular

527
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,340
Financial firms forever you apply your

528
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,840
security measures you're investing in

529
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,600
that so that you know the result is net

530
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,919
positive for you right so your

531
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,440
investment in security should never be

532
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,820
more than you know what you would lose

533
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,620
if something were to happen

534
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,840
but still it's a private decision for

535
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,120
the organization the losses for the

536
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,799
organization the calculations are all

537
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,140
internal whereas in this case like

538
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,960
Colonial pipeline is a good example the

539
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,299
worst outcome is you know okay loss of

540
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,159
production not making profit of the

541
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,100
company but also for the public right no

542
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,960
access to gas or you know gas prices

543
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,320
increasing and you know power not being

544
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,059
available or you know fuel not being

545
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,820
available these are problems that are

546
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,039
Beyond but then for the company somehow

547
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,140
they're supposed to take care of that

548
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,020
right and that's a difficult challenge

549
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,640
um nation states harboring criminals

550
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,980
intending to harm civilians now nation

551
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,960
states attacking each other studying IP

552
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,179
and that's more of an I.T problem but in

553
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,400
this world harming civilians like if

554
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,320
someone were to actually attack in our

555
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,559
pipeline OT infrastructure or power grid

556
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,120
or something and there will be people

557
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,820
you know that will be affected so people

558
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,659
that lost power and or lost um you know

559
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,900
some kind of access to uh uh you know in

560
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,460
a hospital for example if you lose power

561
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,200
then obviously you know everything

562
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,580
that's dependent on it you know it's

563
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,320
also lost right so there might be direct

564
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,440
harm to individuals and companies that

565
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,700
are making decisions on security

566
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,740
Investments these people are making

567
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,679
decisions are now or expected to and

568
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,360
think about these things that are

569
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
outside of their organization

570
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,320
and then these days you have this

571
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,480
additional you know challenge that cyber

572
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,580
security insurance companies

573
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,840
um you know the insurance companies that

574
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,640
are providing or used to provide cyber

575
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,020
security insurance and now saying you

576
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,520
have to have a certain level of cyber

577
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,620
hygiene or risk radiation in place

578
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,960
without really you know explaining how

579
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,520
to get there right so those are the

580
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,679
struggles these people have

581
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,940
now

582
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,840
here's my kind of framework or more of a

583
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,059
process right more or based on you know

584
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,419
a few thoughts based on what worked in

585
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,000
my experience how do you assemble these

586
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,460
people like I mentioned in the you know

587
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,400
in the summary for the stock a lot of it

588
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,140
is you know you have all this external

589
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,299
pressure you have a lot of this context

590
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,100
around you know what you're expected to

591
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,919
do but you have to start from within so

592
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,799
first off if you're an ID or an I.T

593
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,020
security person or a suso or an

594
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,840
executive that's now tasked to

595
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,780
get OT security up to speed or fix this

596
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,080
or let's uh make the problem go away now

597
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,059
let's get some kind of maturity in the

598
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:30,480
um oot space just like in it your first

599
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,419
bet the biggest bet is partnership with

600
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,460
the ICS personnel

601
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,880
so the it and it security teams this is

602
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,980
the most crucial connection the security

603
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,559
success of the organization depends on

604
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,860
right the key is to understand each

605
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,080
other's priorities and really address

606
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,059
the problems and figure out who's

607
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,279
responsible for what it can be

608
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,200
superficial it has to be a genuine

609
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,279
partnership

610
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:59,100
now a list of things that I think are

611
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,460
beneficial first off you hear you know

612
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,460
bring donuts like every time I hear I.T

613
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,720
security people

614
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,279
um mentioning hey bring donuts every

615
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,020
time you go to a pen test or you go to a

616
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,760
risk assessment in an OT

617
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,720
um

618
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,000
um assignment bring donors because

619
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,440
that's what the operators you know would

620
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,539
like it's good it's definitely important

621
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,980
and some of the most successful people

622
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,620
have used it in a very very compelling

623
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,960
manner so I say donor diplomacy and

624
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,840
coffee campaigns work but you have to

625
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,600
have a genuine effort backing it up

626
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,039
right so first off

627
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,159
the safety and quality culture adoption

628
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,159
The Operators and the maintenance people

629
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,679
they have the safety culture they've had

630
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,039
this imbibed in them for decades so same

631
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,659
thing with the quality culture right so

632
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,419
these two have had a long period of

633
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,880
influence on them so they don't

634
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,440
typically start meetings without a

635
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,960
safety moment they probably have you

636
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,940
know quality weeks where they spend you

637
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,740
know weeks figuring out you know once a

638
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,840
year for example for a whole week and

639
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,700
they improve their quality and then

640
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,860
apply it for their ISO certification or

641
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,120
whatever and then the rest of the year

642
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,400
they're doing this new improved process

643
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,559
and then they keep improving every year

644
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,600
so

645
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,059
these two cultures are crucial not so

646
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,220
much about Corey obviously in the I.T

647
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,440
space for sure right but safety culture

648
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,360
is not something that a typical ite

649
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,279
person or ID security person has to

650
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,960
worry about because they're not you know

651
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,120
in front of these things that explore or

652
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,860
things that you know break and cause

653
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,620
damage right so learn that language

654
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,659
attend those orientations you know

655
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,520
they're constantly you know talking

656
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,080
about it you know

657
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,419
they call them toolbox talks where every

658
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,640
day before they start work they have a

659
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,200
five minute chat about what's important

660
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,400
you know uh scaffolding ladder all kinds

661
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,860
of safety cranes right so understand

662
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,600
their mindset and learn their language

663
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,360
and speak their language that's crucial

664
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,220
and then actively seek those Horror

665
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,620
Stories of the past where the typical it

666
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,320
and OT conflict where OT people say

667
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,200
don't touch my stuff hey ID you're my

668
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,299
enemy don't touch my laptop because I

669
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,580
need that for downloading to this PLC

670
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,880
this laptop runs Windows XP and I have

671
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,860
this version of software that works with

672
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,260
that PLC and don't touch it don't you

673
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,480
dare upgrade mine because I have it

674
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,340
configured just the way I want it don't

675
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,500
touch it so you hear this all the time

676
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,200
we don't understand why right so ask

677
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
specifically about what was it that

678
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,299
happened last time an IT guy touched it

679
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,980
like what actually happened right and

680
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,659
they'll tell you they'll tell you that

681
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,279
this path broke something you know you

682
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,799
did something on this HMI and I law you

683
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,779
know there was a loss of you or you

684
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,340
installed something you know endpoint

685
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,620
security you know antivirus upgrade a

686
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,600
signature upgrade or something and then

687
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,419
they have the HMI you know you know hung

688
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,220
up on me and I I couldn't watch so the

689
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,320
operator will say and the worst part is

690
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,460
you know when you did it everything

691
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,039
looked fine and then on um you know

692
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,620
Sunday night at two o'clock

693
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,720
um the early morning you know it it hung

694
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,460
up and you don't know why and suddenly

695
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,320
you can't you know have a view of your

696
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,940
process and that's a problem right it's

697
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,340
a safety risk it's a production risk so

698
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,220
you don't want that so ask those horror

699
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,799
stories and listen and learn and discuss

700
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,360
the worst case scenarios if you're doing

701
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,700
something so hey if I apply this patch

702
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,380
and this HMR is not available this

703
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,120
workstation is not available what's your

704
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,980
worst case scenario what are the options

705
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,779
right then you can come up with a plan

706
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,460
to say okay I have these other

707
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,380
medications in place in case you know

708
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,940
something where people are wrong

709
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,700
and then cultivate a buddy right for um

710
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,260
both the engineer and the technician

711
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,360
levels you need to have at least someone

712
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,279
on the other side right that is

713
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,840
representing you when you're not there

714
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,840
right that way uh you can use them as a

715
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,299
funnel so both because they have a lot

716
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,580
more credibility and you know more than

717
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,860
you certainly because you're new

718
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,679
um and if you can represent you know

719
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,380
security through them other people

720
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,360
listen and follow their footsteps right

721
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,059
and then you can slowly after learning

722
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,220
their language after working with them

723
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,899
getting some credibility that's when you

724
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,279
start teaching right so that's when you

725
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,320
can for example help them Network their

726
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,600
hmis and workstations so that they can

727
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,039
do backups better they can maybe

728
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,899
validate backups better right or install

729
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,020
patches uh quickly if you're helping

730
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,059
them if they genuinely understand that

731
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,100
you know you're being truthful and

732
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,440
helpful and you're saving them time and

733
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,720
then they you know you get that you know

734
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,820
credibility with them then next time

735
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,620
you're offering to do something that is

736
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,200
tricky or difficult or whatever and then

737
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,140
they'll probably follow you

738
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,520
and then this is something that I I

739
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,500
notice all the time so you probably have

740
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,360
older gear that's actually going to be

741
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
really helpful for them so these people

742
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,740
work with old stuff all the time and

743
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,360
let's say a switch failed in the middle

744
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,520
of the night it so happens that uh their

745
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,140
vendor won't support because that switch

746
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,480
has been obsolete for so long

747
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,039
um and they don't know how to configure

748
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,559
it for example so you might have the

749
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,299
hardware or the capability or the

750
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,700
resources to actually help them out in

751
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,460
in their problem and that's it now

752
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,080
you're the hero right because you help

753
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,640
them genuinely with something that

754
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,980
otherwise they would have struggled with

755
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,500
and then co-develop budget and

756
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,539
specification so when they're building

757
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,940
you know their next business case for an

758
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,919
opera control system or some kind of

759
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,720
solution if you can help them with the

760
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,480
security piece right or because you are

761
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,059
a uh you know for net whatever shop on

762
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,980
your I.T side and you know they have

763
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,779
something else that is really old enough

764
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,279
sleep maybe you can say hey maybe

765
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,659
leverage this right I have the

766
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,000
specification I know

767
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,500
um you know what you might want to

768
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,539
include in your specification that'll be

769
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,159
helpful for them

770
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,380
um similarly if you can evaluate the

771
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,240
security features and then at the end of

772
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,860
the day let them make the decision but

773
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,360
then you've given them enough input

774
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,880
right then it's their win it's not your

775
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,720
win

776
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,120
um alone but it's a joint win

777
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,220
and then if you can and this is again

778
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,020
cool right if you can share your budget

779
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,700
dollars especially for things like

780
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,500
endpoint security where you know you

781
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,059
probably have something on the ID side

782
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,220
and collectively if you all agree that

783
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,240
that might be something that's

784
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,340
applicable and could be applied in the

785
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,460
OT space then you might be able to

786
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,899
leverage your corporate whatever

787
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,059
discounts and then help them that way

788
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,059
and then hey that's something improving

789
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,220
security posture at the same time

790
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,260
you know helping them right because

791
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,880
you're not using their dollars for it

792
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
and they don't have it they don't have

793
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,419
that budget and then even perhaps for

794
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,520
network monitoring again not everything

795
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,320
in the IT world translates you might

796
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,820
have to buy something custom specific

797
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,919
for OT but again if you have the budget

798
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,480
and you're collectively trying to

799
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,520
improve the overall security posture for

800
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,039
the organization that's helpful for them

801
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,899
and then this is another key thing right

802
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,360
never say no just because you see them

803
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,000
doing something what you would consider

804
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,279
blatantly anti-security and security I

805
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,799
just don't say no by default right help

806
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:52,260
them understand why or give them an

807
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,480
alternative better option now in the

808
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,279
cloud connected world I mean these days

809
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,899
for example you don't typically email

810
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,059
large files right or or

811
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,100
um files just in an email because it's

812
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,320
insecure you might put their Dropbox

813
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,179
folder and then share with someone else

814
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:07,919
and you know how to track it and you

815
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,299
have all the controls appropriately

816
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,399
right who can read who can who can

817
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,679
access or can download not so much in

818
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,600
this world when it's not as connected so

819
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,399
if someone wants to you know copy stuff

820
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,760
from a PLC or an HMI and then send it to

821
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,039
the vendor right now the only way they

822
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,320
do it is you know copy it on a USB and

823
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,059
then ship it right because these are

824
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,340
huge files if you can figure out a

825
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,140
better way if you have a network way to

826
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,260
do it right and still save again that's

827
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,640
helpful for them

828
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,100
so you have to work with them if they

829
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,899
say no what will end up happening is

830
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,519
they'll find a way especially you know

831
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,380
the production is impacted and if they

832
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,140
have to get it going on the weekend they

833
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,480
will do whatever is necessary to do it

834
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,519
right they need to give the vendor

835
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,100
access to their credentials so the

836
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,960
vendor can remotely log in they'll do it

837
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,460
it's not because they want to do it in

838
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,140
securely it's just that they have to get

839
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,519
the production going and you're not

840
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,440
there right you haven't given them the

841
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,919
support needed to do it securely

842
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,019
so after you do that right the ICS

843
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:08,820
person will obviously very important

844
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,039
absolutely the number one partner that

845
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,019
you need to you know get to that Purdue

846
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:13,919
level

847
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
um you know security Zone and conduit

848
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,480
model but there's also other Personnel

849
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,360
so the operations people

850
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,880
the operations people are the users of

851
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,260
the technology so they are the ones

852
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,480
operating these hmis and they are the

853
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,460
ones that are pushing buttons right and

854
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,960
they also are the first people to get

855
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,299
process alarms and it will talk about

856
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,100
all kinds of process anomaly detection

857
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,440
and network monitoring and if you

858
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,320
remember Oldsmar Florida last year

859
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,700
apparently the operator was the one that

860
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,980
noticed that someone remotely was you

861
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,140
know making modifications to the uh so

862
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,019
you know sodium hydroxide lie in the um

863
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:51,059
in the HMI so that's an operator

864
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,519
noticing it right they're typically the

865
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,679
first line of defense it's it's so many

866
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,240
times it happens all the time that they

867
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,279
smell something fishy they are the

868
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,500
process anomaly experts they're the

869
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,840
human experts they are looking at the

870
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,059
Mantra the the monitoring and looking at

871
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,679
these readings all day long so something

872
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,260
doesn't match they they sense a pattern

873
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,399
like they are the ones that notice

874
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,260
something wrong so if one someone with

875
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,120
the manipulate anything right even

876
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,039
without this cursor moving on the screen

877
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,279
something were to change in the process

878
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,320
they are the ones to notice it

879
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,700
and then remember that the operators and

880
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,080
the maintenance people including the

881
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,240
instrumentation controls people they're

882
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,860
not always aligned because they're two

883
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,539
different departments right if the

884
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,340
operator says something is wrong it's

885
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,200
the instrumentation technician now that

886
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,899
has to go and calibrate that sense or um

887
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:41,580
you know the transmitter or do something

888
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,720
so

889
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,120
these are the work givers in in one way

890
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,519
in one way and the maintenance people

891
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,080
will have the work day care right they

892
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,640
have to go fix it so they're not always

893
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,919
100 on the same page so you might

894
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,659
actually get more honest feedback from

895
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,279
The Operators if something were to go

896
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,320
wrong right instrument response you know

897
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,120
some kind of forensics and you're like

898
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,340
what actually happened like what did you

899
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,419
see first

900
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,399
who did what

901
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:08,040
um if you ask the Inc a technician or

902
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,020
the engineer they might be a little bit

903
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,520
more guarded because they have to now

904
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,199
act on it they have to do something or

905
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,300
accept that there is something wrong uh

906
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,739
even though they shouldn't but the

907
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,599
operators might be like yep that's what

908
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,918
happened these three things happened

909
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,960
that guy pushed the button and this guy

910
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,940
you know uses USB and he didn't scan

911
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,918
whatever the case might be you'll

912
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,379
probably get a more accurate picture if

913
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,020
you talk to The Operators as well

914
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,980
and then overall right work with HR hire

915
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,139
for this new world so if an experienced

916
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,139
person is retired in ICS or you know the

917
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,599
operators you know find the new folks

918
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,339
that are willing to collaborate willing

919
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:47,159
to be more you know horizontal than just

920
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,260
vertical this is my feel I'm gonna just

921
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,659
be an expert in this one thing and I'm

922
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,060
not you know not collaborate versus the

923
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,679
new world is you know more people are

924
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,740
you know multi-skilled and at least to

925
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,720
an extent they're interested in other

926
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,099
things right so they might not be

927
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,780
responsible for security that's not

928
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,700
their job but they might be interested

929
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,140
in you know making the organization

930
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,160
secure

931
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,859
and then allow for cross training right

932
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,660
HR shouldn't be like this is your job

933
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,660
you do this uh versus hey maybe once a

934
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,700
month have this person Shadow the I.T

935
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,220
security person so that the OTP people

936
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,660
are aware of

937
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,700
what the it security people do on a

938
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,980
daily basis and why they do a thing or

939
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,839
two differently from them right and

940
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,820
likewise like at the it security person

941
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,160
you know work with the OTP people to

942
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,800
understand their world a lot more not

943
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,599
just the language not just the words but

944
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,940
how they struggle right what do they

945
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,619
need to do on a daily basis to keep the

946
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,320
process running so and maybe one day a

947
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,960
month or maybe more often but some level

948
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,660
of collaboration is definitely a lot

949
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,619
better

950
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,839
you know that and the traditional way of

951
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,760
you know you do your thing I do my thing

952
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,640
then of course legal right

953
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,800
um sharing information

954
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,839
um again you have infrastructure right

955
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,520
so there's a lot of Ip involved there's

956
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,079
a lot of Regulation and compliance

957
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,660
involved and pii especially even things

958
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,940
that you wouldn't consider maybe secret

959
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,579
or private like energy usage right uh

960
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,020
whether the company the organizational

961
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,880
level or a plant level or maybe a

962
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,099
customer level those things could be

963
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,320
very sensitive so you got to have legal

964
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,119
involved make sure that you're able to

965
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,000
share information and across teams and

966
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,980
with outside Venice especially you're a

967
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,359
service provider or something like that

968
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,520
right and then of course planning for

969
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,540
instant response legal team legal HR of

970
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,040
course all the others as well like we

971
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,720
talked about the liability performance

972
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,359
safety Engineers uh when it comes to an

973
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,579
instant response in an OT facility right

974
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,480
think about it as a very distinct

975
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,720
um experience compared to an I.T

976
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,680
ransomware incident or something like

977
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,560
that in not world right you're thinking

978
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,780
about something that can affect cyber

979
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,700
physical processes so something were to

980
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,280
go wrong I'd say somebody did something

981
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,200
with the HMI and then downloaded the

982
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,480
code to the PLC now you have to make

983
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,339
sure that your process is safe to run

984
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:08,040
right so your instant response is not

985
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,320
just hey how many systems are affected

986
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,160
it's what type of effect it is and can I

987
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,140
restart this plan is it safe to run

988
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,000
right that's a crucial difference in

989
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,420
this OT space where these people

990
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,760
you know it has to be planned and

991
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,460
carefully applied very different from

992
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,280
the from the it1 so these in my

993
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,780
experience like these people right you

994
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,960
gotta have a big picture A lot of

995
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,700
patients obviously and willingness to

996
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,800
learn and understand each other's world

997
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,079
to work with them because historically

998
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,320
those folks were not responsible for

999
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,000
security and didn't have to think about

1000
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,460
security so those are some of the

1001
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,619
thoughts folks um I did have another

1002
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,359
study that I took out because I don't

1003
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,980
want to talk about all the other

1004
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,660
technical stuff right like you know I

1005
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,240
put this uh task synopsis for reference

1006
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,980
here because again I want to make sure

1007
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,540
that we've been there

1008
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,300
message together there's so much you

1009
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,099
know framework development standard

1010
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:08,760
development compliance some kind of

1011
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,260
thought process and how to

1012
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,359
systematically get from a low secure

1013
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,760
phase to in a high secure phase all the

1014
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,280
security levels that Isa 62443 talks

1015
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,859
about but all that aside the key is

1016
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,200
people right we really need to address

1017
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,140
the people behind the OT behind the

1018
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,960
Purdue model pictorial to really get

1019
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,839
anything it is changing it is really

1020
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,400
evolving a lot more investment a lot

1021
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,740
more thought going on in it but the key

1022
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,300
is we have to execute right it's one

1023
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,040
thing to have mobile thoughts and that

1024
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,240
to execute

1025
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,640
but that folks are happy to answer any

1026
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,800
questions if you all have

1027
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,520
um I'll pause on the slide and see if I

1028
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,240
can take any questions

1029
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,520
well done go back to it's very very good

1030
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,880
you you dove into

1031
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,119
murky Waters with nuanced answers and

1032
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,460
didn't shy away from taking on the tough

1033
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,579
challenge I appreciate that you fleshed

1034
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,640
out a lot of really good stuff here

1035
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,560
thank you and I appreciate that

1036
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,839
any questions poke them into into

1037
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,240
Discord

1038
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,980
um

1039
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,320
yeah this slide was uh

1040
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,300
quite the talent yep no yeah that was uh

1041
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,980
quite the list

1042
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,500
Vic uh what what kind of donuts should

1043
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,780
we bring

1044
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,440
excellent question make sure it's a mix

1045
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,180
because there's always a one guy or a

1046
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,420
gal that doesn't like chocolate

1047
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,640
or doesn't like strawberry cream oh man

1048
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,520
I I always like well I was on both ends

1049
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,320
right so I was one of those uh field

1050
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,880
Engineers that was on the receiving end

1051
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,859
of donuts and also the guy that would

1052
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:55,920
take Donuts so always make sure you get

1053
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,660
a big big mix

1054
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,660
nice very good nice

1055
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,540
I really like this is like hitting on

1056
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,880
many things that I've seen

1057
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,280
have really powerful effects building

1058
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,040
relationship donut diplomacy I love that

1059
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,420
typically seeking Horror Stories of the

1060
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,420
past uh like you know tell me about the

1061
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,920
stupid I.T people you've dealt with in

1062
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,540
the past

1063
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,220
um

1064
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,140
right yeah because it's if you don't ask

1065
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,180
right they're gonna tell you anyway but

1066
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,920
they'll only tell you a version of it

1067
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,200
that you never understand why you have

1068
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,660
to conjecture what happened and why

1069
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,940
instead if you just ask them like what

1070
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,980
did I do like what did my predecessor do

1071
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,140
like what actually happened and

1072
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,420
oftentimes it's something silly you know

1073
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,579
it's like yeah it hung up but then we

1074
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:47,520
rebooted and it was fine well then why

1075
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,680
didn't you say so right so that's why

1076
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,240
the second part like what's the worst

1077
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,460
case like if you had to reboot then you

1078
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,200
know what happened right was it

1079
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,700
something really that affected the

1080
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,920
operation well yeah like it really you

1081
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,480
know it was a struggle I got yelled at

1082
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,880
by the production supervisor

1083
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,619
um or it could be I had to go to this

1084
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,680
other section display and had to look at

1085
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,599
you know whatever numbers there while

1086
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,359
this was rebooting so I think that takes

1087
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:13,619
away that

1088
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,560
um that that pain right that either they

1089
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,819
they willingly are hiding or maybe they

1090
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:23,520
just you know giving you a tough time

1091
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,680
for something that was just silly well

1092
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,960
even if I mean even if you know the

1093
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,920
answer

1094
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,560
you're asking a question changes the

1095
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,920
dynamic and allows you to try to build a

1096
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,780
partnership a relationship of positive

1097
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,119
instead of them just continuing to treat

1098
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,119
you as the bad guys yeah that's outside

1099
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,900
yeah

1100
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,040
right I mean you don't I mean it's easy

1101
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,960
right like I always say oh man I'm so

1102
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,400
sorry you have to go through it I mean

1103
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,020
it's not so that's the sentence I use

1104
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,520
right it's not like I'm sorry for

1105
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,680
because I didn't do it right but I'm so

1106
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,839
sorry that you have to go through it and

1107
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,240
how can we do better right like then

1108
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,880
it's a conversation about okay next time

1109
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,520
you do this you tell me first or tell me

1110
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,020
what's the worst case that could happen

1111
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,300
yeah you applied this patch uh what

1112
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,520
could happen right so maybe together you

1113
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,920
can't put the strategy to say I'm taking

1114
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,660
this back up

1115
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,520
um and if something were to go wrong I'm

1116
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,380
gonna install this right or I have this

1117
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,319
undo plan uh something that you both can

1118
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:27,900
agree upon that's a lot better A lot

1119
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,540
smoother conversation then I gotta do

1120
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,760
this dude I'm so sorry but I gotta do

1121
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,160
this yeah plus we're talking about

1122
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,520
really combating a couple decades worth

1123
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,700
of I.T people thinking that they own all

1124
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,380
the knowledge about cyber security and

1125
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,839
hope to see people saying You Don't Know

1126
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,720
Jack about the stuff that kills people

1127
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,520
don't try to treat me like you're you're

1128
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,040
rebootable Windows machine in the corner

1129
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,339
yeah and if you nail this app

1130
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,619
so so we're building bridges we are we

1131
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,440
are having to form relationships across

1132
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,240
the in this the second time I've done

1133
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,099
this today but across the Democratic

1134
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,160
Republic line you know it's like

1135
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,020
bridging political parties especially in

1136
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,119
the U.S today with how terrible it is

1137
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,579
it's a lot of that same thing

1138
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:16,740
but compared to that real politics this

1139
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,740
is a lot easier I mean our Our Lives yes

1140
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,359
they were difficult but not as difficult

1141
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,160
as real politics so thankfully

1142
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,079
thankfully in this case right we're all

1143
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,640
working for the same company in most

1144
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,800
cases that's the common denominator

1145
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,660
right you're like you all have the same

1146
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,819
plant manager so you know saying vice

1147
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,099
president or whoever so worst case you

1148
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:38,280
go talk to them say hey who is right I

1149
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,560
got to do this you told me to go fix

1150
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,480
this and this guy is not allowing

1151
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,700
because of something else but let's chat

1152
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,099
right so yes it's not as easy but at the

1153
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,839
end of the day we have this common goal

1154
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,819
and somebody's gonna make that executive

1155
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,800
decision so usually this is not as bad

1156
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,599
as real politics

1157
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,060
fair fair but only if you build the

1158
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,819
bridge I mean only if you I mean we all

1159
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:02,520
suffer from from imposter syndrome and

1160
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,880
some degree or fashion and

1161
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,980
we need to come into a situation where

1162
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,359
we present ourselves like we know what

1163
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,400
we're talking about how do we do that in

1164
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,140
a way that

1165
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,079
doesn't come off like we're pooping all

1166
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,480
over somebody else's ground and building

1167
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,339
a relationship while still representing

1168
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:23,660
that we're competent

1169
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:28,440
yeah yeah well that's a good point so

1170
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,560
you should never be um it can't be

1171
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,480
either of these two so one situation I

1172
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,880
see that is like you said you go in and

1173
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,980
say I am the security guy what do you

1174
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,900
know so let me just do it my way so

1175
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,339
obviously we talked about it you don't

1176
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:43,680
want to do that the other thing is you

1177
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,900
know you go in and say I understand like

1178
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,280
you know because you speak the same

1179
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,160
language you say I understand but still

1180
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,680
not actually get to what they need right

1181
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,540
it's one thing to say I understand your

1182
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,740
pain

1183
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,339
um

1184
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,380
so let's figure out a solution it's

1185
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,720
another to say I understand but this is

1186
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,160
the secure way and you have to do it

1187
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,339
like for example MFA or

1188
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:06,960
um you know any other security measure

1189
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,060
right active directory for example if

1190
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,619
you talk to an average instrumentation

1191
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:13,140
or ICS controls engineer you know

1192
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,579
they're not Microsoft people they're not

1193
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,680
I.T people they're programmers they are

1194
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,560
you know process people so if you for

1195
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,000
example want to incorporate active

1196
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,560
directory and say yep you have to do it

1197
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,240
because X Y and Z you know we have all

1198
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,740
these requirements it's a lot easier

1199
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,660
then you're not really listening or

1200
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,400
paying attention to their problem right

1201
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,020
so you've actually spoken their words

1202
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,460
and you talked about hmis and

1203
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,980
workstations but nothing changed that

1204
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,660
that's not helpful right so you really

1205
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,000
have to find the balance where you

1206
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,619
genuinely incorporate that feedback to

1207
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:42,900
say okay these are the things that are

1208
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,520
difficult and and you are the person

1209
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,160
that's you know I use Sunday morning

1210
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,560
it's so strange that the world's

1211
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,359
problems somehow always happen on the

1212
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,880
weekend like it's just unbelievable so

1213
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,859
as long as you're not the guy helping

1214
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,140
them at that time you really have to

1215
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,819
listen to them

1216
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,740
I really like you talking about saddle

1217
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,300
security satellites is what I like to

1218
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,859
call them where you've got the people

1219
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,079
they're not security people but you've

1220
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:08,760
built a connection they understand the

1221
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,339
importance and and they're interested so

1222
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,700
that there can be a voice of security in

1223
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,280
in every given area even if they don't

1224
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,200
have a security person on staff there

1225
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,300
yeah so I mean that's something that

1226
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,640
already happens in the safety world so

1227
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,020
they typically have a safety

1228
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,819
representative in each division they

1229
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,800
probably have sometimes a quality

1230
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,020
representative these people are doing

1231
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,180
other jobs Quality Art security is not

1232
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,040
their daily job but they're representing

1233
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,500
that group that concept for their

1234
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,380
division right they might have a monthly

1235
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,300
meeting and they get some new updates oh

1236
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,240
this is what is coming in our

1237
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,220
recertifying for this ISO 27 000 Series

1238
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,260
so what do we have to do like when is

1239
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,880
the audit coming up that might be the

1240
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,619
quality rep for the group saying hey

1241
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:55,200
guys that's coming and then let's you

1242
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,940
know prepare ourselves same thing with

1243
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,920
the safety representative that person

1244
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,960
might be saying I.E might be getting

1245
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,300
updates about the you know new standards

1246
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,640
coming up oh they change the policy you

1247
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,920
know OSHA change the policy uh for

1248
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,079
scaffolding so now instead of four feet

1249
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,060
are about needing

1250
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,819
is scaffolding now it's three feet right

1251
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:17,280
so of course the safety representative

1252
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,540
is going to talk about it there's going

1253
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,619
to be an email there's going to be an

1254
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:22,140
OSHA notification but what really makes

1255
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,400
a big difference is a safety

1256
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,740
representative talking to his own or her

1257
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,780
own peers right that uh this is

1258
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,300
happening same thing with the security

1259
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,339
um we don't have that yet like we don't

1260
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:34,319
have security reps in each divisions but

1261
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,240
that's where we need to be like we can't

1262
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,980
expect all the people to become security

1263
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,800
people but we need to have that culture

1264
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,920
of security slowly but in OT

1265
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,090
foreign

1266
00:47:46,090 --> 00:48:15,159
