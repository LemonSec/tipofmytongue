[Music]

2
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,220
so

3
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:27,360
[Music]

4
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,040
hey everyone thanks so much for joining

5
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
today and thanks to grim khan for the

6
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
opportunity to speak with you all i'm

7
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
gonna jump right into

8
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,439
the conversation so welcome to my talk

9
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,840
control validation compass intelligence

10
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,399
for improved security validation

11
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,320
my goal for today is to provide you

12
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
practical workflow guidance for starting

13
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,439
to better apply intelligence to your

14
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,399
security program to drive improvements

15
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
within it and help better measure those

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
improvements

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
my name is scott small i have a

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
background in intelligence analysis risk

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
management and open source

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,240
investigations and most recently i was

21
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,720
working for a major intelligence vendor

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,280
within their customer success team

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
so what that meant is i was out there

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
having conversations every single day

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,480
with our clients who were largely medium

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,640
and large size enterprises as well as

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,200
government agencies around the

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
challenges that they were facing in

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
trying to apply intelligence to their

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,360
security programs

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
so i'm really excited for the

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
opportunity to speak with you today

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
because most of what i'll be touching on

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,239
is derived in one way or another from

35
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,200
conversations i've had with our clients

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
out there in the field learning their

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,879
challenges and trying to find some

38
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,640
solutions for getting around them

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,519
much of what i'll be speaking about

40
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,480
today will be uh relying on and relating

41
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,599
to the minor attack knowledge base so i

42
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,760
want to quickly level set with everyone

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,000
and just provide an overview of what is

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
minor attack and what are its greatest

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,879
strengths i really see a huge

46
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,280
intelligence value and applications from

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,480
minor attack

48
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,920
for driving improvements in security

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,760
again what is the minor tech knowledge

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,480
base it is quite simply a catalog of

51
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,280
adversary behavior it allows us to

52
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,319
pinpoint uh unique adversary tactics

53
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,400
techniques and procedures and gives us a

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,319
common language to be able to reference

55
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,959
back to those across teams in different

56
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,519
organizations maybe within a single

57
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,480
organization even

58
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,799
just a few more details the way that you

59
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,680
also often see the information in minor

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,080
attack presented is in this matrix view

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,000
i know this is fairly grainy image and

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
that's kind of intentional we don't need

63
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,120
to worry too much about the details for

64
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
right now what i mostly want to

65
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,920
highlight in these matrix views is

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,959
the very first row within a matrix these

67
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,280
are known as minor attack tactics these

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
are essentially the end goals or

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
objectives that an adversary would try

70
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,959
to

71
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,200
be accomplishing when they carry out a

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
cyber attack

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,959
arranged vertically in the columns

74
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,840
beneath those headers are what are known

75
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,000
as techniques and more granular sub

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,920
techniques these are essentially just

77
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,839
the ways or means

78
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,079
specifically that adversaries go about

79
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,000
conducting cyber threat activity

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,199
i want to now walk through one specific

81
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,759
example of the miter attack knowledge

82
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,560
base and again emphasizing the real

83
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,440
value that i see it providing in

84
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
allowing us to bridge the gap between

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,840
those kind of higher level strategic

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,600
objectives that adversaries might be

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
trying to accomplish and the very

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,759
specific and granular ways that they're

89
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,919
carrying out this activity

90
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,759
so i'm highlighting here on the matrix

91
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,080
one specific miter attack technique it's

92
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,639
known as impaired defenses this simply

93
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,880
refers to ways that adversaries try to

94
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,919
disrupt our defensive operations perhaps

95
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,320
turning off security logging functions

96
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,199
or actually even messing with

97
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
and and modifying those logs themselves

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
again minor attack allows us to pinpoint

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
and refer back to this specific

100
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
adversary behavior

101
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,919
one of the additional benefits of miter

102
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,919
attack is in drilling down into uh

103
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,000
pinpointing and identifying specific

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
behaviors we're able to oftentimes see

105
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
details as granular as which command

106
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,720
lines are adversaries using or which

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,199
processes are they calling to conduct

108
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,440
these activities so here you're seeing

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,160
an example of that this is actually a

110
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,520
search that you can deploy within a sim

111
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
tool a security logging and aggregation

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,199
tool that allows you to detect the use

113
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,840
of the impaired defenses technique what

114
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
this is doing is looking for specific

115
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,720
instances of command lines being used to

116
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,160
actually turn off a popular open source

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
ransomware antivirus tool

118
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
so that was one good example of showing

119
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
kind of the granularity of the minor

120
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,880
attack matrix but at the end of the day

121
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,919
in reality we as defenders are not uh

122
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,240
often seeing just one instance of a

123
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,360
specific behavior within uh our logs and

124
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,440
uh the information in front of us we're

125
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
in reality seeing very many potential

126
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
techniques or behaviors scrolling across

127
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,160
our screens all day long so this just

128
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,680
starts to be a little bit more

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,120
representative of what we would

130
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,520
experience in the real world

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
the good news is that just like we had

132
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,639
previously

133
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,800
we oftentimes have these really granular

134
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,039
details and again command lines

135
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,360
processes files that are used by

136
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,160
adversaries to perpetrate cyber threat

137
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,639
behavior we often have these details for

138
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,639
a very large portion of the overall

139
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,960
miter attack matrix and you're seeing

140
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,479
this displayed now on the slide i've

141
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
intentionally kind of made this a little

142
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,720
bit busy because at the end of the day

143
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
we almost have a little bit too much

144
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,360
information than any of us could really

145
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
reliably kind of dig into and start to

146
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
learn the nuances of all these specific

147
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
techniques

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
oftentimes if you're going to be running

149
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,120
these searches or really this is uh

150
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
logic that's allowing us to detect these

151
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
adversary behaviors in reality if you

152
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,000
want to run these in a large or even

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
medium-sized enterprise environment

154
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,680
you're oftentimes going to be needing to

155
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,720
do some customization according to the

156
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,759
unique nuances of your environment and

157
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,400
how much noise you have going on or even

158
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
what access to log information you even

159
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,240
have you really kind of need to dig in

160
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
oftentimes and create some

161
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,479
customizations here

162
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,440
so quite simply the way that i see kind

163
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,639
of best meeting that challenge is uh by

164
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,280
prioritizing which techniques we want to

165
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
dig into and investigate a little bit

166
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
further and now i'm kind of representing

167
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,720
that in this visual with maybe some

168
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
prioritized techniques appearing in the

169
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
darkest blue

170
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,360
this allows us of course to focus in and

171
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,039
really kind of clean up and improve

172
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
maybe some of these detection rules that

173
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
we want to deploy within our own

174
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,319
environment and create those unique

175
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,400
customizations that are needed according

176
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,280
to

177
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,960
the the our own organization

178
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
in an ideal scenario as well we're also

179
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,070
going to be

180
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,440
[Music]

181
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
testing those new detection rules and

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
controls that we put in place and i'm

183
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,919
highlighting this now on the slide as

184
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,080
well much of what you've been seeing

185
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,640
along the way here both the detection

186
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,360
rule logic as well as these

187
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,080
offensive security tests to test out our

188
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
detections are increasingly being made

189
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,719
openly available

190
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,839
via publicly accessible repositories so

191
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,279
things like github

192
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,680
databases very much of this is is

193
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,279
increasingly available to the general

194
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,200
public which is at the end of the day

195
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
really good news for those of us who may

196
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,200
be starting on our journey towards this

197
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,519
entire control validation feedback loop

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
but now i want to provide just some

199
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
quick metrics kind of capturing the

200
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
scale of that problem i mentioned where

201
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
we almost have too much information and

202
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,800
detections to potentially even consider

203
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,560
so at this point in time the minor

204
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,880
attack matrix continues to grow and

205
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,839
there are now nearly 600 discrete

206
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
techniques and sub techniques within the

207
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,480
overall knowledge base

208
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,399
on top of that there are nearly

209
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
countless implementations so even if

210
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
we've defined down the level of what's

211
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,240
known as a sub technique there are

212
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
oftentimes many

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
different discrete variations that we

214
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,320
can use to actually run that sub

215
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,839
technique in a real environment

216
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,959
and one of the most interesting things

217
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,720
uh is that i recently took a survey of

218
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,440
all of these major publicly accessible

219
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
detection rule and offensive security

220
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,519
test repositories and in aggregate uh

221
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,560
summed up actually well over 9 000 of

222
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,839
these detection rules and 2000 of the

223
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,760
red team or offensive security tests

224
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,320
that are publicly available right now so

225
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
again just really kind of emphasizing

226
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,440
the scale of

227
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
the great news that we have this

228
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,480
information at our fingertips but how do

229
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,320
you begin accessing it and then actually

230
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
fine-tuning and cleaning up these

231
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,920
detections before you run them in your

232
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
environment we need to do some

233
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
prioritization

234
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
the way that we most often saw this

235
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,600
prioritization playing out is through

236
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
the use of intelligence and ultimately

237
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,680
uh culminating in what is known as a

238
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
threat profile or a threat model

239
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
and so we won't get into all the details

240
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,880
of building a threat profile in today's

241
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
conversation but what i'm highlighting

242
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
here with the text at least are some of

243
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,279
the specific components that are most

244
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,440
often taken into account when you're

245
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,240
building a threat or risk profile

246
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
so certainly you would want to be aware

247
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
of potentially which adversaries exist

248
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,600
in the world today and which are most

249
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
likely to target you

250
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
uh but then many more kind of internal

251
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
facing factors so what is your actual

252
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,079
visibility into the logs and data

253
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,160
sources within your own environment and

254
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,760
what do you actually have access to are

255
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,360
you able to aggregate those in a single

256
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,640
place

257
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
on the uh

258
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
additionally within the kind of internal

259
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,279
space

260
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,079
what is your actual coverage of your

261
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,480
security controls and if you're able to

262
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
align that with the framework such as

263
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
minor attack what does that kind of

264
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
distribution of coverage actually look

265
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,399
like these are all factors that ideally

266
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
should be taken into account in a full

267
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,480
robust risk profile

268
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,959
so in working with our clients in

269
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,680
building these profiles you know coming

270
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,440
from a threat intelligence background

271
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
we're of course going to be focusing

272
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
pretty heavily within that upper left

273
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
corner of

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,760
which adversaries exist in the world

275
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,279
today and which ones might be most

276
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,880
likely to target us

277
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,480
at the end of the day a lot of it really

278
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
came down to

279
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,839
which adversaries are we seeing

280
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,639
targeting organizations like ours and a

281
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,800
lot of that came down to an industry

282
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,680
basis so which threat actors and malware

283
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
have we seen recently targeting maybe

284
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,839
our most immediate industry peers

285
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
companies that look most like us as well

286
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,720
as which ones have targeted the industry

287
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,079
generally

288
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,760
so in processing through all that

289
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,839
information and intelligence we could

290
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,440
ultimately uh summarize this

291
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,279
in a visual like what you're seeing on

292
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,200
the screen now this is kind of a heat

293
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,240
map and the most notable or top priority

294
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
threat actors are appearing in the upper

295
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,200
right corner of our screen

296
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
i've got some links throughout here to

297
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,839
good publicly available resources that

298
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,279
can help you kind of take some of the

299
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,120
steps to build uh visuals and and

300
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,880
profiles like what you're seeing on the

301
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,800
screen right now

302
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
so this is great to know we've got a

303
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
nice maybe short list uh in the upper

304
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,440
right hand corner of uh five to ten top

305
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,760
priority actors for example what can we

306
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,360
do with that information well we can

307
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,240
then pivot on that short list to

308
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
potentially look for these specific

309
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,040
tactics techniques and procedures ttps

310
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,600
or adversary behaviors associated with

311
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,880
that short list of top priority actors

312
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
the way that we most often would run

313
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,040
these exercises is by aligning those

314
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,519
ttps with the minor attack

315
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,360
knowledge base and that gave us the

316
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,680
ability to consistently refer back to

317
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,839
the same techniques and sub techniques

318
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,360
that we're observing

319
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,279
so we've got now is this nice heat map

320
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,440
visual the miter attack matrix and

321
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,440
highlighting now the top priority ttps

322
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,480
associated with our top priority actor

323
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,199
and malware groups

324
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,519
so this is also still great information

325
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,600
to know and this is a pretty nice visual

326
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,519
you can uh throw this up on the the

327
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
screen and you know a lot of folks will

328
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,920
maybe be able to identify at a super

329
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,519
high level what we're actually talking

330
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,440
about the techniques in the brightest

331
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,519
red are you know for some reason

332
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,120
standing out to us and probably more

333
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,040
notable but what can we actually do with

334
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,199
that intelligence now that we know the

335
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,160
the top priority ttps this is literally

336
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,639
a question that i was posed many times

337
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,320
originally in working with clients

338
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,079
through these exercises when the

339
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,399
exercise would basically stop with this

340
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,920
visual

341
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
so from here we wanted to take some

342
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
additional steps and help our clients

343
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,839
start to operationalize this ttp

344
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,639
intelligence me walk through a little

345
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,880
bit of what that looked like

346
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
so uh in this case the client

347
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,680
organization was utilizing the splunk

348
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,880
sim technology again uh log aggregation

349
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,560
and uh and normalization tool

350
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
so what we can see and this is all

351
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,959
publicly available and accessible is

352
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,079
splunk within its github repository

353
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,639
actually provides quite a few

354
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,519
of these detection rules and search

355
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,279
logic that you can run within that

356
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,240
solution to be able to detect instances

357
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
of adversary behavior

358
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,760
and i'm highlighting some interesting

359
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,839
things that are included within this

360
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
detection file on the screen right now

361
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,079
so at the top we're seeing the actual

362
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,480
discrete search logic just like we were

363
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,240
seeing in my original minor attack

364
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,040
matrix visuals as well as in the bottom

365
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,240
left corner

366
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,480
the miter attack techniques that were

367
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,360
kind of

368
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
tagged to this rule meaning this rule is

369
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,800
intended to be able to recognize

370
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,199
instances of this behavior if we have

371
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,600
that log data and sources within our own

372
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
environment

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,399
so taking a step back and pulling down

374
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,639
all of these detection resources

375
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,480
available on the splunk github

376
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,279
repository we can start to aggregate and

377
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,920
essentially count up uh align with miter

378
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
attack which techniques and sub

379
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
techniques are there the most detection

380
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,440
rules for within this specific resource

381
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
on top of this specific tool the client

382
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,360
organization in this case was also

383
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,399
utilizing something known as sigma rules

384
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,040
this is simply a third-party

385
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
standardized format for writing

386
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,199
detection rules that you can then

387
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,160
convert and start to deploy within tools

388
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,639
like splunk or elasticsearch or many

389
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,839
others

390
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,639
so

391
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,639
very much like we were seeing previously

392
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,120
there is a publicly available sigma rule

393
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
repository

394
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
and we can pull down all the data and

395
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,279
the rules within that and start to once

396
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,000
again visualize and aggregate at a large

397
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,399
scale where are we seeing most of the

398
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,320
detections or the highest concentrations

399
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,560
of them all aligned with the minor

400
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,880
attack knowledge base having that here

401
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,120
now

402
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,079
uh what i'm highlighting here as we

403
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,320
continue to progress along with throwing

404
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
some data in these progressive columns

405
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
is a very simplified way of kind of

406
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,320
starting to get a sense of what is the

407
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,839
baseline or out of the box coverage

408
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,399
according to minor attack of these

409
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,880
various security tools and technologies

410
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
and resources i'm quickly highlighting

411
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,480
here on the right hand side of this

412
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,760
slide uh a far more robust framework for

413
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,439
starting to do this kind of internal

414
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,359
control mapping there are a few others

415
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,439
that exist as well um and and you can

416
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,439
find those mostly publicly available but

417
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,480
i didn't want to highlight this if

418
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,839
you're looking to go you know probably

419
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,520
several steps deeper than this

420
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,839
simplified version on the screen there

421
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,919
absolutely are resources that exist that

422
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,598
can help you on that journey

423
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:29,919
[Music]

424
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,960
all right so as we kept moving right um

425
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,799
what we began to realize and speaking

426
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,720
with additional clients is that there

427
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
were in fact many different tools and

428
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
resources that exist in the world today

429
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
and there seem to be continually adding

430
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,720
more

431
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,400
publicly available

432
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,880
resources that are mapping to the miter

433
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
attack knowledge base and you're seeing

434
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,679
this listed out on the slide so

435
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,440
as we we move for the right we add

436
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
additional sim tools and maybe a few

437
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,360
sore tools edr technologies as well as a

438
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
bunch of uh

439
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
openly available repositories for

440
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,840
detection rules on top of that my point

441
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,360
about wanting to go out and test in a

442
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
safe manner that these detections are in

443
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,240
fact alerting uh as you would expect

444
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,080
them to there are many publicly

445
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
available repositories for those red

446
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,720
team or offensive security tests as well

447
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,880
and it kind of just kept expanding from

448
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,360
there so at a certain point i realized

449
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,120
with my massive spreadsheet that i

450
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,919
nearly recreated the matrix and i almost

451
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,200
stopped there that's of course

452
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
everyone's end goal in cyber security is

453
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,240
to create the matrix but i decided to

454
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,039
keep persisting on and building out this

455
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,840
sheet i didn't want to give up there and

456
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,320
what i this ultimately culminated in uh

457
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
i'm very excited to be able to share

458
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,200
this with the group on the line today

459
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,360
basically open sourcing and making

460
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,440
available all of these aggregated

461
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,600
mappings and many of the discrete

462
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
resources that that kind of form them

463
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,320
are behind them putting it all into a

464
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,880
web app and a publicly accessible

465
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,400
resource for you all to be able to

466
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
access

467
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,520
and i was excited and able to kind of

468
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,840
publicly publish this uh not too long

469
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
ago and so the tool itself is called the

470
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
control validation compass

471
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,679
and uh here's the quick url to go start

472
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,440
at least accessing the the web app

473
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,799
version and start playing around with

474
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,020
this data

475
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,080
[Music]

476
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,679
so end of the day what is control

477
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,080
validation compass uh it is an open

478
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,320
source tool pointing cyber security

479
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,360
teams to as i mentioned those well over

480
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,400
9000 publicly accessible technical

481
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
controls things like detection rules as

482
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
well as kind of higher level policy

483
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
controls a lot of frameworks and and

484
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
resources out there uh in that regard as

485
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
well that align with meyer attack

486
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,840
as well as those uh well over 2000

487
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,840
offensive or red team tests to go

488
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
check and validate those detections that

489
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,320
you put in place everything included

490
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,159
within the control validation compass

491
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
resource is explicitly aligned with

492
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,200
minor attack techniques or some

493
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,440
techniques so attack really does kind of

494
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,520
form the core uh and central uh

495
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,120
uh

496
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
the center of essentially this this tool

497
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
here

498
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,159
so just throw a couple real quick

499
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,240
screenshots the tool is very much live

500
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,159
uh and well and i encourage you to go

501
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,760
check it out and and start playing

502
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
around with it i hope that it's pretty

503
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
intuitive to at least start dipping your

504
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
toes into but what you can do uh on the

505
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,600
very first landing page is just perform

506
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,080
a lookup by the mitre attack technique

507
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,880
sub technique or its plain text name

508
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,039
and immediately return

509
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,400
all of the

510
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,360
detection and policy controls and

511
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,919
offensive security tests that are

512
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,280
aligned with it

513
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
so what uh when we first released the

514
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,039
tool we simply were providing the

515
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,720
mappings and then some additional

516
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
written guidance around how you can

517
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,080
navigate through all these various

518
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
repositories that contain the details

519
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,200
behind

520
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,360
again the rules and the tests

521
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
we've now already rolled out a few

522
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
improvements to start to point you back

523
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
directly to the underlying rules and

524
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,679
resources and we're going to keep

525
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,039
building that out

526
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,480
over time just to make it that much

527
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,440
simpler for an end user to be able to

528
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
start grabbing and actioning uh some of

529
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,039
these resources

530
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
uh but this was at least a high level a

531
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
quick way of kind of summarizing

532
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,840
everything that exists within these

533
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
repositories around a given minor attack

534
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,160
ttp

535
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,320
[Music]

536
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
from there we can start to expand out

537
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,240
even a little bit further and start to

538
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,720
identify uh potentially all of the

539
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,919
resources that exist for a variety of

540
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,600
tools so now we're not just looking for

541
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,679
a single technique or some technique but

542
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,000
actually for multiple at once and the

543
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,559
way that this page works is you get to

544
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,880
toggle on and select potentially which

545
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,919
of these

546
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,880
tools or third-party data sets you're

547
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,799
using within your own environment right

548
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,280
now and get the complete listing of the

549
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,559
mappings

550
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,799
across all of those resource sets

551
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,480
and then the final piece of this which i

552
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,240
certainly find that the most interesting

553
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,480
and i hope can kind of continue to lower

554
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,200
the barrier of entry towards applying

555
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
threat intelligence towards your

556
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,320
security improvement efforts is the

557
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,799
threat alignment page

558
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,480
what we see here on the left-hand side

559
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
is very similar to what we were seeing

560
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,559
before you get to pick and choose which

561
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,919
of the controls

562
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,200
you might be using within your own

563
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,960
environment or you can certainly take

564
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
kind of just a global view and show me

565
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,559
everything in aggregate

566
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,480
you can check all those boxes and just

567
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,559
start to see all the data that exists

568
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,320
but the really key component of this is

569
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,400
over here on the right hand side the

570
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
threat intelligence drop down

571
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,440
this allows you to input a threat

572
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,400
intelligence data file and allow you to

573
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,600
ultimately output just the

574
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,159
controls and resources that exist

575
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,200
for the miter attack ttps contained

576
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,400
within your threat intelligence input

577
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
and by this i mean we have some

578
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,679
supporting resources linked on the site

579
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,280
you're seeing that right here

580
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
the way that this data is intended to be

581
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,159
formatted is minor attack provides an

582
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,000
open source tool called the attack

583
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,159
navigator that is really designed to

584
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,200
allow you to visualize and start to more

585
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,760
easily navigate as it says

586
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,000
around the quite large minor attack

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
matrix

588
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,080
you can populate that user that that

589
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,480
that tool uh they have a user interface

590
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,919
that allows you to click and select

591
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,600
different techniques and start building

592
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,360
one of these heat map views that i was

593
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,200
showing previously

594
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,600
you can then export that data into a

595
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,320
json format and in speaking with quite a

596
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,039
few

597
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,880
clients and others in the community who

598
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,360
are somewhat familiar with this tool i

599
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
came to realize that this is actually a

600
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
pretty quick and easy way to create

601
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,919
again kind of a portable file uh that

602
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,559
allows you to essentially uh take and

603
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,400
carry around threat intelligence and use

604
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
it in a few different ways so by

605
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
dropping in one of these attack

606
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,960
navigator layer files as they're called

607
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,600
uh directly into the tool we can run

608
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,840
this uh the line it up button and we'll

609
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,000
immediately get that output of again

610
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
just the controls and testing resources

611
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,000
for the specific ttps that matter most

612
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,679
to you so you could build one of those

613
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,400
threat profiles build a nice heat map

614
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,320
export the data from the navigator and

615
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,480
then start to surface the detections and

616
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,880
tests around specifically those top

617
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,600
priority techniques as they're defined

618
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,000
for you

619
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,279
just to add a little bit more detail and

620
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,880
nuance around this i'll of course be

621
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,799
sharing the slides afterwards i mean i

622
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,480
have a ton more of those supporting

623
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
resources that will uh take you through

624
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,120
in much more depth depth some

625
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,960
best practices for actually building

626
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,039
these uh threat profiles and starting to

627
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,200
generate relevant intelligence but a few

628
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,360
details and and what i often advise

629
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,520
clients who are especially getting

630
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,200
started in this journey i want to

631
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,960
highlight a few resources that i always

632
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,279
recommend they go kind of check out so

633
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,200
the first of which is of course the

634
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,799
miter attack website and their own

635
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,360
database that they maintain around

636
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,880
actors and malware or software that has

637
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,799
been known to be carrying out threat

638
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,279
activity in the recent past so one thing

639
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,640
you can do in the upper right hand

640
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
corner here is search across the entire

641
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,240
miter technology base for keywords

642
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,200
relating to industries this is again a

643
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
really key way that we can start to

644
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,679
generate some findings that would be

645
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,720
most relevant to our unique organization

646
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,559
that we're supporting and so you can run

647
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,200
searches for healthcare or financial

648
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
related uh industries or other keywords

649
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
and oftentimes as we're seeing here come

650
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,919
up with some interesting results some

651
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,559
actors or malware that may be of more

652
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,840
notable interest to

653
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,600
us on top of that this is a tool

654
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,080
produced by the cert organization within

655
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,799
thailand uh very similar kind of just a

656
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,120
database of actor and malware groups and

657
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,200
they actually contain specific uh

658
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,440
taggings for all of their profiles for

659
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
these groups

660
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,400
that align with certain industries and

661
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,240
so this is another very user-friendly

662
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
way of searching across a fairly large

663
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,039
data set for industry-based threats that

664
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,158
might matter more to you

665
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,720
certainly uh government advisories as

666
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,200
well as uh just other vendor reports um

667
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,760
we're increasingly seeing these reports

668
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,480
aligning explicitly with minor attack

669
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,880
ttps and so this is a really great

670
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,400
resource for everyone to start to kind

671
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
of generate and see those key codes that

672
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,360
that might be appearing

673
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
and then finally maybe even just some

674
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,520
very generic kind of open source

675
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
searching but i do have at least one

676
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,200
tool that i can recommend that kind of

677
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,120
makes that process a little bit smoother

678
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,720
and can cut through some of the noise

679
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,000
that you might be seeing just in a

680
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
generic web search result

681
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,279
so this is a custom search engine that

682
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
you can utilize specifically drilling

683
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,000
down and running your search keywords

684
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,799
against a very large number of cyber

685
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,360
security specific resources this is

686
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,120
potentially a good way as you're seeing

687
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,799
here you can run a minor attack

688
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,120
technique or even its identifier it's

689
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,240
key code

690
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,799
within a search database like this and

691
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,320
potentially come up with some recent

692
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,399
relevant findings this is where you kind

693
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,080
of know exactly generally what you're

694
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
looking for but you want some additional

695
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,520
supporting data around it

696
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
all right what i'll close with uh is

697
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
giving you in addition to you know going

698
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,320
out and finding some of these resources

699
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,520
on your own uh as a way to promote uh

700
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,360
ease of use around the control

701
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,000
validation compass tool i've started to

702
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,720
publish a number of additional examples

703
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,200
of these layer files threat intelligence

704
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,960
that you can start to drop into this

705
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,919
tool

706
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,039
if you don't want to go through all the

707
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,440
steps of trying to build those attack

708
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,080
navigator layers yourselves so there's

709
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
even one pre-populated directly within

710
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,240
the tool that you can just immediately

711
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,679
click line it up and start playing

712
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,919
around with the data but beyond that if

713
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,240
you want a few readily available

714
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,799
examples i'll point you to my github

715
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,559
repository

716
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,039
around cyber adversary heat maps

717
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,720
essentially what i've been doing here

718
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,399
i'll try to maintain this for the

719
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,640
foreseeable future to the extent i can

720
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,600
is

721
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
some of the recent

722
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,640
roll-up reports from government agencies

723
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,960
as well as threat intelligence vendors

724
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,279
that are explicitly looking at miter

725
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,760
attack ttps i've started to kind of

726
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
aggregate some of that data and so you

727
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,919
can see a few just a handful of recent

728
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,440
reports i'm going to keep building this

729
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,679
out but for example the very first

730
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,039
example here is coming directly from

731
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,000
that

732
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,919
cyber security and infrastructure

733
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,640
security agency recent report around

734
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,799
russian state-sponsored and criminal

735
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,679
cyber threats to critical infrastructure

736
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,200
if you even just scroll through this

737
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,880
report you're going to see a number of

738
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,279
references back to the miter attack

739
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,840
matrix and even the website itself many

740
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,600
of these links will take you to the

741
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,760
minor attack profiles

742
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,799
for these major russia-based cyber

743
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,039
threat actor groups and if you follow

744
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,880
along all those steps you can pretty

745
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,840
quickly come to see quite a few discrete

746
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,320
actor groups and and malware groups that

747
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,240
are explicitly being called out in this

748
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,799
report this is very recent very fresh

749
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,799
and quite honestly uh generally pretty

750
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,960
relevant information for a lot of

751
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,360
organizations

752
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,760
that exist right now

753
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,919
so what this data ultimately looks like

754
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,720
is some of this json structure again uh

755
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,039
this is these are minor attack navigator

756
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,960
layers that i went ahead and created and

757
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,559
i'm just saving it's all based on

758
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,720
publicly accessible data i've got the

759
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,039
source information right in here for you

760
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,279
as well but you can go now take these

761
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,039
again drop them into that threat

762
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,120
intelligence tab within the control

763
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,679
validation compass and start to surface

764
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,640
some of the actual operational controls

765
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,960
and tests all aligned with these

766
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,279
specific adversary techniques so i think

767
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,440
it's just hopefully one more effort

768
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
to give you uh you know some handy

769
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,200
resources to start actually playing

770
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,080
around with this data and hopefully

771
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,679
better applying intelligence to your

772
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,279
security efforts

773
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,440
so i'll close out with my final slide

774
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,880
which again will be shared these

775
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,960
resources to help guide you along the

776
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,440
way and i truly appreciate the the time

777
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,360
and attention and thanks so much for the

778
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,399
opportunity to speak with you today

779
00:30:36,430 --> 00:31:03,770
[Music]

780
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,510
you

781
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,700
[Music]
