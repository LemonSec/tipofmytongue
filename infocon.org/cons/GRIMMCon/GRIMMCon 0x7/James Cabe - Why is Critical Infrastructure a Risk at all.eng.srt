[Music]

8
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,439
I didn't hear what you said I just said

9
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,939
you were born in Oak Ridge Tennessee

10
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,680
yeah

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
do do your feet glow in the dark I have

12
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
a nuclear family over there or like

13
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
Trump that's the best

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,420
yeah that's all I'll claim talking to my

15
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,140
friend Maggie uh who used to work at Oak

16
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,200
ORNL

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,020
and she said that uh there were there

18
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,318
were stories about

19
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,840
rainy lots of rain and frogs jumping

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,599
across the uh the parking lot and

21
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,319
getting uh tires cars running over the

22
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,920
frogs on the way out actually set off

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,540
nuclear alarms at the state border

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,640
is that sound legit uh

25
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,480
a little bit left back in time because

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,099
um if you roll into Oak Ridge you know

27
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,080
it was set up it was basically what they

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,120
used to call a hauler just a really big

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,800
version of that right it's all set

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,680
inside of a a series of they said

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,780
Mountains they're not real Mountains

32
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,300
they're they're Foothills right and uh

33
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,000
and a defensible spot right so you roll

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
down into it and then you go right past

35
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,959
the old gun in placement that used to

36
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,360
have the Guard Station and it's still

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,300
there so the the place really hasn't

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,860
changed all that much now most of the

39
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,420
Laboratories and everything else that

40
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,680
are just on the outside of that closer

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,800
to Knoxville but it's all still there so

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,540
I know that uh at least in

43
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,060
uh Clancy books

44
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,480
there do you remember

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,459
[Laughter]

46
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,760
so there's a book by Tom Clancy where uh

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,640
we apparently gave a gave a nuke to the

48
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,720
to the Israelis back in 1973 just in

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,180
case uh that nobody ever knew about but

50
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,000
they ended up finding it to tracking

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,180
down the uh the nuclear material and it

52
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,980
came from that neck of the woods down

53
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,379
there in the TVA area

54
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,580
but anyway oil and gas well I don't I

55
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,900
think that's uh that is a uh you know uh

56
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,599
illustrative of the the the the fact

57
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,680
that everybody thinks it's a little bit

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,900
more laid back down there but um it when

59
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,780
in fact it's not uh uh dad used to warn

60
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,879
us about going into the woods too far uh

61
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,379
because we lived fairly close to some of

62
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,180
the facilities and there was something

63
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,280
called duck Hunters out there so if

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,540
you're from the local area you know what

65
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,760
a duck hunter is and uh they're just

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,858
guys dressed in camo that you know they

67
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,320
look like they're you know uh you know

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,298
out straight off a hunting's trip and

69
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,220
and uh and yet they they hold a black

70
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,900
gun in their hands that looks very very

71
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,660
menacing so there is that so you gotta

72
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,580
watch out for the duck Hunters uh but

73
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,360
yeah

74
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,660
um wow so anyways how are y'all doing

75
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,300
today uh so far in the conference I I'm

76
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,340
gonna I'm gonna personally admit to

77
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,919
something right now uh I was on earlier

78
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,720
and of course because I've got presenter

79
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,180
level uh capabilities I was actually at

80
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,720
my son's uh trying to help out with uh

81
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,240
the the uh

82
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,540
field trip which I was actually uh had

83
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,280
held over because one of the kids got

84
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,620
injured and I was there waiting for the

85
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,240
nurse to show up that had to come all

86
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,000
the way over from the thing so I um may

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,500
or may not have put my brand new phone

88
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,660
which I'm not used to using I'm I'm an

89
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,539
iPhone guy in my pocket and all of a

90
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,400
sudden I realized there everybody's

91
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,020
wondering like why is there a noise on

92
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,520
this thing right now and I'm like oh my

93
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,220
God and I went and and killed it as

94
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,900
quickly as I possibly could but that was

95
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,300
me earlier and it was actually a very

96
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,740
good video I really wanted to listen to

97
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,960
the CSO video I actually had a a lot of

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,580
time for the speaker although I love to

99
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,740
say when y'all play a video at least on

100
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,660
my headphone combination with go to

101
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,000
meeting or go to webinar it's for some

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,100
reason completely mutes it so you rarely

103
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,600
get into the audio so it's like sitting

104
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,160
there and listening listening and then I

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
reach down put the phone in my pocket to

106
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,699
go pick a kid up and put it and then lo

107
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,100
and behold I'm I'm there

108
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,979
blaring soccer games and you know people

109
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,139
with uh with balls and everything else

110
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,699
anyways that I digress so

111
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,100
thank you thank you for owning it you're

112

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,240
yikes so anyways we've eaten into your

114
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,160
time and we're just gonna let you take

115

it away you've got a lot of cool stuff

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,600
to talk about uh and you clearly have a

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
have a background worth listening to let

118
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,580
me go ahead and present real quick let's

119
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,440
see where is the presentation make sure

120
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,940
that uh you are a presenter hold on

121
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,360
uh James yes

122
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,000
there you go a little bit how I hunt uh

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,100
for industrial Control Systems whenever

124
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,660
I'm doing pin testing and things like

125
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,160
that

126
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,940
um and I I did pin testing when you're

127
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,319
not where it really wasn't allowed to

128
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,199
before the ceh even existed so

129
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,960
um you know uh so so we'll go a little

130
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,819
bit over my background and and kind of

131
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,080
give you everybody in the audience

132
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,900
exactly where I'm coming from

133
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,599
um so uh I've done this for a long time

134
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,460
if anybody's old enough they probably

135
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,800
know who BBN planet was

136
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,300
um it's actually not really where I cut

137
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,800
my teeth I actually worked at Gateway

138
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,080
2000 before that before the internet was

139
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,020
even around and and you know as tech

140
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,240
support on the phone uh telling people

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,340
how to and literally emailing them

142
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,800
drivers on floppies and having people

143
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,880
walk through about how to fix their

144
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,620
Gateway 2000s with the screwdriver of

145
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,120
course that that was the kind of people

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,099
that bought gateways so it wasn't too

147
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:18,660
bad at the time and this of course was

148
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,580
before I think Dell was even around so

149
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,940
that's really where I started my career

150
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,919
um and then and I went over to BBN

151
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,300
because I knew some of the people that

152
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,520
were on the compute side and the kind of

153
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,840
the rest of his history went off to New

154
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,120
York did some Consulting

155
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,919
um you know ended up uh going down to

156
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,020
oil and gas uh through the Consulting

157
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,280
thing

158
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,840
um and worked for a company called Devon

159
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,099
for a while

160
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,080
um they had an International Group uh

161
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,720
where I did a lot of OT security and

162
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,280
well it wasn't security at the time then

163
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,900
it was it was just called networking

164
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,720
right so um and infosec was just sort of

165
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,120
something that that happened either

166
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,699
naturally or not naturally right so and

167
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,340
I actually tell stories that sound a

168
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,660
little pirick at first but they're not

169
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,860
at all

170
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,500
um we were down in Equatorial Guinea you

171
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,360
know uh doing a bunch of drilling and I

172
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,060
actually was the one flown in to do the

173
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,220
satellites and put in the switching and

174
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,599
even the telephone and everything else

175
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,979
that make it all work over satellite

176
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,319
which wasn't that easy at the time

177
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,460
um now everybody's like oh that sounds

178
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,319
like it's simple but at the time it was

179
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,319
not a not a simple job to get done

180
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,440
um and uh and you know where you saw

181
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,240
people downloading stuff over LimeWire

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,520
which you know or an Appster which was a

183
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,080
thing at that point in time because you

184
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,519
know you're bored you're on a rig you're

185
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,200
between you're floating into different

186
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,500
places to drill for for energy and uh

187
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,880
because you know you're waiting

188
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,059
basically um to to do your work and so

189
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,320
lots of people got in trouble by

190
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,580
downloading stuff and there was really

191
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,339
no web content filtering at the time so

192
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,320
you kind of had to you know hammer it

193
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,820
down what they needed to get to and then

194
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,100
write regexes and you know what people

195
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,660
could get to and everything else to do

196
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,760
filtering control so it wasn't that easy

197
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,140
so people got around it all the time

198
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,940
especially with the way peer and appear

199
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,260
worked at the time because there was no

200
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,000
deep packet inspection in the world at

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,740
all at that point I mean there was

202
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,360
there's Wireshark or there's actually

203
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,519
ethereal and then the previous version

204
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,620
of that which I will not name on this

205
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,480
phone because it just sounds wrong so

206
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm just not going to

207
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,440
um it's hard to separate ether and ape

208
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,760
at the same time so I'm just not gonna

209
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,160
you see that still actually if you go to

210
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,260
I think black hat still uses it on the

211
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,620
board on in the sock over there so

212
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,720
um and and then and then actually uh

213
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,920
have people downloading except well the

214
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,980
one thing that was the default share was

215
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,660
the actual entire C drive so you saw

216
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,940
very odd IP addresses that only I

217
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,160
recognized downloading stuff directly

218
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,959
off the C drive that was actually some

219
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,560
of the um production uh databases for

220
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,959
the rigs and then magically all of a

221
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,940
sudden all these blue roofs appeared in

222
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,260
West Africa

223
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,640
um and the Chinese had come in and

224
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
started investing very heavily into the

225
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,640
area because I realized I guess they

226
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,959
realized how much oil and gas was there

227
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,760
because it was actually free to download

228
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,620
all that information at one point in

229
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,279
time so uh infosec uh had its day and

230
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,560
age even very very long ago even in the

231
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,779
OT fields to keep that stuff uh at least

232
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,399
at the time it was air gapped and now

233
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,140
it's less and less so so we're gonna

234
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,459
we're gonna probably talk a little bit

235
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,980
about that and why it seems to go

236
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,779
further further into operational

237
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,700
Technologies and with the separation of

238
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,440
them are what the different games are

239
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,820
and everything else of that but but I've

240
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,740
been around doing this a very very long

241
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,940
time

242
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,160
um and uh you know if you have any

243
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,300
questions about any of the companies

244
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,160
I've worked for or I've worked with for

245
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,740
over that period of time uh you're more

246
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,480
than welcome to to call me on the carpet

247
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,860
or even something I might have said in

248
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,540
LinkedIn because that's kind of my

249
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,279
platform my social platform of choice

250
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,940
whenever I'm I'm discussing stuff so one

251
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,279
of the biggest problems actually uh in

252
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,899
critical infrastructure in operational

253
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,180
technology is actually the pro clutching

254
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,860
that goes on whenever people do start

255
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,260
talking about cyber security because one

256
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,760
of the biggest problems that we actually

257
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,560
have is actually not talking each

258
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,240
other's language

259
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,040
um you know people on the information

260
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,019
technology side of the house will say

261
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,120
hey look you have you've connected this

262
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
stuff to ethernet you know most of the

263
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,740
stuff uses IPS transport and now you're

264
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,839
using you know Windows servers and Linux

265
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,640
servers and things like that to actually

266
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,860
do to go get your data up out of

267
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,380
something they call IEDs and not you

268
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,060
know don't want to give anybody any kind

269
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,240
of a shock with that the the original uh

270
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,740
thing for the acronym was actually

271
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,660
intelligent electronic device

272
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,420
and um and that's they stopped calling

273
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,800
it them as much as that now everybody

274
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,459
just calls it OT and iot and iot uh

275
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,899
which is a little softer term than than

276
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,279
calling something an intelligent

277
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,079
electronic device but that's really what

278
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,000
we're talking about and and the base of

279
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,339
that is knowing how to take the digital

280
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,380
zeros and ones and turn them into pulse

281
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,540
width modulation and if you really want

282
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,339
to get down to the very core of what

283
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,160
happens in OT is that pulse with

284
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,100
modulation regulates the speed of Motors

285
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,720
um it regulates whether you know

286
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,940
temperature control and all kinds of

287
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,440
stuff like that on the basic level

288
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,720
you're actually turning uh the digital

289
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,180
into analog at some point in time and

290
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,560
that's usually through that pulse width

291
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,880
modulation

292
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,500
um and some sort of control Fields

293
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,680
inside of very very very basic

294
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,360
um uh microcontroller and

295
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,100
microcontrollers as we all know or you

296
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,600
know if you've played with Raspberry Pi

297
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,459
or Arduino or anything else like that

298
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,040
it's really just a memory register to

299
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,980
get something to either turn on a 5 volt

300
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,600
switch or turn off a five volt switch or

301
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,540
12 volt or 24 volt or 48 volts or you

302
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,220
know oscillate them you know on off on

303
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,839
off on a different speeds to either make

304
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,420
a motor go faster or go slower or turn a

305
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,399
light on or turn a pump on or shut a

306
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,440
valve off or whatever it is on that sort

307
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
of thing so that's the problem with that

308
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,440
is

309
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,959
they use a very very different the OT

310
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,820
Engineers or process control Engineers

311
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,399
or PES use a very very different set of

312
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,260
tools they're they're basically

313
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,120
developers and you know there's already

314
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,120
a lot of animosity between developers on

315
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,160
the I.T side and the information

316
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,100
information security side of the house I

317
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,600
think one of the talks about that was

318
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,820
earlier when it talked about devsecops

319
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,339
which was a great talk as well on on

320
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,279
this particular uh conference and and

321
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,079
that actually spoke and I really wanted

322
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,600
to pipe in and say that's exactly the

323
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,519
problem in operational technology as

324
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,380
well because people that program the

325
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,060
logic are basically just programmers

326
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,339
much much more low level in some some

327
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,220
ways but less and less so where now some

328
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,079
of the stuff that even runs its own API

329
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,120
and has its own lamp stack directly on

330
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,220
something called the PLC or programmable

331
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,019
logic controller or you know if you just

332
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,180
want to use the Layman's or the the

333
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,360
parlance of the field or term of art

334
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,459
um it's the controller right so the

335
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:39,899
controller of these things and they you

336
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:40,980
can either have the control or built

337
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,440
directly into the IED or you can

338
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,820
actually have a controller that talks

339
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,040
logic to a group of them

340
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,899
um you know to have have something that

341
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,399
that uh you know that you're dealing

342
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,620
with so and and most people refer to

343
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,620
most of this stuff as scada and and uh

344
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,120
you know that supervisor control and

345
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,740
data acquisition

346
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,860
and you know uh so that supervisory

347
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,320
portion is the hmip so human machine

348
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,060
interface and what people don't

349
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,560
understand is where that looks like just

350
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,480
a flat panel to a lot of people it's

351
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,279
actually Windows 10 embedded Windows 7

352
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,260
embedded Windows XP embedded in a lot of

353
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,480
cases and and essentially it talks

354
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,800
Windows protocols because people had to

355
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,660
be able to manage those things and talk

356
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,279
with the programming interfaces in them

357
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,860
and that's that's actually as a Prelude

358
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,660
to the later on in the talk that's

359
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,019
really where we have that Meetup of the

360
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,019
it and OT first is that human machine

361
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,579
interface and the engineering

362
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,620
workstations which are essentially user

363
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,380
space where you know you have incredibly

364
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,000
large amount of control of that user's

365
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,639
face in that that system

366
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,079
um where it's much much harder to lock

367
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,880
down it was much harder to lock down a

368
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,560
web server and what you can actually get

369
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,820
to in a web server than it is giving

370
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,220
someone a Citrix or or

371
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,220
um or a vdf some sort of vdi uh

372
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,240
interface

373
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,260
um I can't tell you the incredible

374
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,300
amount of lockdown I had to do to give

375
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,399
somebody a virtual desktop once upon a

376
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,380
time it's a lot easier now and it's a

377
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,000
lot more ephemeral than it was before

378
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,880
and set to a large degree immutable but

379
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,399
once upon a time it wasn't any of those

380
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,860
things and so that's actually where

381
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,660
we're at still in the operational

382
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,339
technology world where the IT world

383
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,959
marches on a little bit at a little bit

384
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,339
faster Pace

385
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,100
OT because of the physicality of it

386
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,779
because the sheer amount of investment

387
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,779
in a pressure vessel or a pump or a

388
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,720
valve or a pipeline is orders of

389
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,300
magnitude larger and so you have to

390
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,820
realize the value out of that at a over

391
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,920
a much longer period of time than you do

392
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,740
the I.T stuff and it's not to talk say

393
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,360
that the IG stuff isn't just important

394
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,579
just as important because data as people

395
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,199
have said is the new oil I don't know

396
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,759
what that's supposed to mean it could be

397
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,320
in the new water the new water is the

398
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,180
new oil who cares what it is it's just

399
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,120
very valuable commodity in in today's

400
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
day and age and to that point

401
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,800
um let's talk about the differences and

402
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,779
focuses between Information Technology

403
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,820
cyber security and operational

404
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,740
technology so

405
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,720
um in it it's really about the

406
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,660
information right so um some people say

407
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,820
the user identity is the new perimeter

408
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,440
you know because now the perimeter is

409
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,300
dead and you have to do zero trust stuff

410
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,639
so things along those lines

411
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,620
um I would tell you I don't really do

412
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,540
you have a darn about the users I always

413
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,339
care about the data if I'm talking got

414
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,240
my it hat on my tin foil hat and

415
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,800
um and and I'm going to say look the

416
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,420
most important thing isn't even my users

417
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,519
it's my data that I'm the one that's

418
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,839
supposed to manage that's the first and

419
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,480
foremost most important thing uh about

420
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,980
what I'm doing and what I'm trying to

421
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,720
take care of is that is my data so

422
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,600
really data is my new where the data is

423
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,880
kept at is my new parameter wherever

424
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,680
that is and however hard that is to get

425
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,899
to and then

426
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,220
um you know be able to maintain the

427
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,019
confidentiality and integrity of that

428
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,759
stuff and even standardization so you

429
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,980
can actually ingest the data very easily

430
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,240
so most of the people that have

431
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,519
practiced I.T security know the big

432
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,019
three letters especially if you're a

433
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,940
cissp because they drill it into you

434
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,100
confident you know constantly and that's

435
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,559
CIA or confidentiality integrity and

436
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,059
availability those are the big three

437
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,280
that you have to pay attention to and

438
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,599
normally at this point I'd point at the

439
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,859
audience and say okay what are the big

440
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,199
three on the OT side so I can't do that

441
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,199
here I'm just giving a presentation so

442
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,760
um so I'll give you a couple of hints

443
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,400
you got to manipulate physical things so

444
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,199
you need control of them

445
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,599
um they're very very specialized and you

446
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,579
have to maintain some some ability of

447
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,020
safety and availability of the whole

448
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,200
thing so normally what I get here is

449
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,760
um it's going to be availability at the

450
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,080
very bottom the most important thing or

451
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,240
is data confidentiality is really the

452
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,220
most important part of that particular

453
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,059
ecosystem because without

454
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,220
confidentiality keeping integrity and

455
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,900
availability is actually very very hard

456
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,780
so it's kind of the Keystone of of what

457
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,280
you're going to be doing on the cissp

458
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,620
the same way most of the people I get

459
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,900
that talk to me say that availability is

460
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,280
the same way on operational technology

461
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
and I'll tell you you get close but

462
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,000
that's not really it availability is

463
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,760
secondary specifically to safety of the

464
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,080
process itself now that doesn't mean the

465
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,640
safety of the workers because

466
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,500
unfortunately I've been you know to

467
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,240
Baytown Texas which isn't too far north

468
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,360
and east of me and maybe places that

469
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,860
make Plastics and stuff like that they

470
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,260
use something called a phos gene gas and

471
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,059
foxting gases you can't actually have

472
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,860
the pressure vessel that that holds that

473
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,860
stuff explode however sometimes somebody

474
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,780
gets something wrong in a bit of logic

475
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,419
or something happens somewhere and you

476
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,220
know that pressure that gets over over

477
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,840
pressure and the thing instead of

478
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,340
blowing a valve and releasing all the

479
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,419
gas

480
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,320
um they have to do some sort of

481
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,120
outcasting well there's a big alarm that

482
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,500
goes off and everybody has to get their

483
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,600
PPE on which is the protection equipment

484
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,880
personal protection equipment and then

485
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,260
and then they do the release after

486
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,700
giving you a certain amount of alarm

487
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,559
well if you don't have them on or you

488
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,000
don't know about it you can't hear the

489
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,620
sirens

490
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,820
um then all of a sudden you're walking

491
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,860
through fasting gas and I don't want to

492
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,080
tell anybody what that's like but you

493
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,640
can just go ahead and take a you know

494
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,679
Google it if you prefer if you really

495
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,720
want to be morbid about it but it is not

496
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,000
good for anybody's health even in this

497
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,020
very very short period of time so safety

498
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,980
especially safety in the system itself

499
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,440
trumps even the safety of people and and

500
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,059
and being able to make sure you safely

501
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,559
shut down that thing without blowing it

502
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,120
up or something bad happened and

503
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,760
availability is always secondary to that

504
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,620
um because sometimes the availability of

505
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,720
the system gets shut off because maybe

506
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,820
the the security the safety part of it

507
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,980
is something called this sis or safety

508
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,600
integrated system where the safety

509
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,700
itself the logic is actually built

510
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,919
directly into the IED that's controlling

511
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,179
maybe the pressure on that thing where

512
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,280
it's not even part of the ecosystem it's

513
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,500
not even connected to the ecosystem it's

514
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,760
just hey this thing's going into

515
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,220
shutdown it sends out one single signal

516
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,660
that's unidirectional saying I'm

517
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,000
shutting down the rest of this DCS

518
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
better pay attention because I'm going

519
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,360
to go and shut everything else off as

520
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,500
well and I'm gonna try to bring

521
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,880
everything down in a very very safe

522
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,380
manner well that happens sometimes

523
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,600
sometimes it just happens as a blow off

524
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,919
or something else like that and then you

525
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,260
end up with with uh larger issues

526
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,700
unfortunately so those are the big three

527
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,160
on the OT side so knowing that it if

528
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,700
they had a GIC what is that giac it's

529
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,120
the GI SCP I always forget with that one

530
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,080
too

531
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,360
um so pardon me with the acronyms um I

532
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,700
don't have my acronymicon next to me

533
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
um I I do however have the Necronomicon

534
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,080
somewhere in the the room somewhere as

535
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
you can tell you know with all the stuff

536
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,220
going on around me but but uh anyways

537
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,140
bad jokes aside

538
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,760
um there are two different focuses

539
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,919
especially when it comes to cyber

540
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,960
security and I'll I'll boil it down even

541
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,059
further for everybody else here

542
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,340
um it's not even the same game right

543
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,559
um if you play it with I.T security it's

544
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,179
really a game of keep away and the ball

545
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,159
is your data right

546
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,659
um sometimes your users depend on how

547
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:41,039
important they are as well to the whole

548
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,320
process but yes uh data is the most

549
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,820
important thing it's really a game of

550
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,280
keep away and I I I have to join up with

551
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,320
Chris Roberts like them or not he's

552
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,760
right about the hoodie thing and I just

553
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,500
cannot stand you know hoodies with the

554
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,059
hacker thing anymore and the original

555
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,400
tournament hacker still makes me draw my

556
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,620
fingernails down down a chalkboard

557
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,200
anyway so the other one uh when it comes

558
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
to OT systems is really King of the

559
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,559
mountain and this is my really really

560
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,360
bad infographic at Kingman Mountain so

561
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,460
pardon me for that but it's really about

562
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,500
who has control at that point in time so

563
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,000
it's not even not even the same game

564
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,260
that you're playing when you're dealing

565
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,179
with OT security is opposed to I.T

566
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,100
security so laying the groundwork for

567
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,200
that the modern systems really

568
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,419
everybody's like wow connected is hacked

569
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,460
and to some degree that's absolutely

570
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,299
true

571
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,159
um so you do have Safety Systems and

572
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,539
other control systems that are

573
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,400
completely air gapped away in some cases

574
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,340
especially if the the process itself is

575
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,600
extremely

576
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
um uh dangerous especially for a

577
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,980
community or something along those lines

578
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,880
right

579
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,080
um so you'll see the safety Integrated

580
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,400
Systems that are going to be completely

581
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,840
offline

582
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,460
um you know and maintained by people

583
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,080
that are directly on property or on

584
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,600
premise unfortunately because people get

585
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,120
disgruntled they are also still at risk

586
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,919
it's not necessarily because of the

587
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,480
internet anymore

588
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,799
um but it can actually be from the

589
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,760
employees themselves somebody

590
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,860
disgruntled or something else like that

591
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,419
and I think I when I worked for Fortinet

592
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,280
I think we did a study at the time and I

593
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,480
think it was with um

594
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,280
actually did it for us and I think

595
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,980
almost 83 percent of all the actual

596
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,559
threats to an individual company or to

597
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,059
you know people at that particular

598
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,520
company are actually insiders

599
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,280
um whether through you know just

600
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,039
incompetence uh laziness tiredness or

601
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,020
what have you got what have you going on

602
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,400
or even somebody who's actually

603
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,780
malicious

604
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,880
um 83 of all the threats whenever it

605
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,799
comes to compute systems in general and

606
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,179
that doesn't matter if it's it or OT

607
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,620
because they're all all based on

608
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,820
computers

609
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,280
um is part of the problem so knowing

610
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,200
where things at are important to

611
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,840
protecting them but it it doesn't matter

612
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,120
as much anymore because I've seen people

613
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,559
have a better security posture because

614
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,179
they're more

615
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,860
um they're more uh um I would say

616
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,780
what is the word I'm looking for careful

617
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,059
well I wouldn't even I wouldn't even say

618
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,559
that they're they're paranoid but

619
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,179
they're more careful with the way they

620
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,799
deployed stuff

621
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,080
um even in the cloud sometimes simply

622
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,000
just because they know that things are

623
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,559
easy to reach there

624
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,700
um the availability is high when the

625
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,280
ability is high uh that means that that

626
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,740
you've you've actually to some degree

627
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,419
um killed some of your information

628
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,100
technology capabilities because

629
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,840
sometimes you play the two against each

630
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,940
other if the if it is highly available

631
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,980
the the data

632
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,120
um then you can actually end up with

633
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,559
lots and lots of cyber security problems

634
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,539
as well especially on the integrity and

635
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,940
and the uh and the confidentiality

636
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,220
portions of it and so just so you know

637
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,080
when I think the last slide picture was

638
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,159
better

639
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,179
the King of the Hill

640
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,059
this one they that's a much better

641
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,799
picture than the other yeah good job

642
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,679
boiling it down to a kids game for me is

643
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,779
is really where it's at right like

644
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:56,640
that's the most important part because

645
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,220
to be quite honest with you

646
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,260
um I deal in very very simple things

647
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,120
right easy and simple or two different

648
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,299
things uh if you keep it simple

649
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,620
um sometimes you'll get it right almost

650
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,360
every time it's not about you getting

651
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,400
always easy because because that can be

652
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,779
a different concept making things look

653
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:16,200
easy is not always a simple process so

654
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,100
um this was taken very recently and I

655
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,059
only show this because I mean

656
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,799
everybody's seen a picture like this all

657
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,940
over the place but this was something

658
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,059
that was taken very recently I mean last

659
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,919
week even so I had to include it in this

660
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,020
presentation the first bad thing

661
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,120
whenever it comes to where we're failing

662
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,700
in critical infrastructure is the use of

663
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,000
passwords if there's one com one thing

664
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,860
that should have been password you know

665
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,059
without passwords a long time ago it's

666
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,200
gonna be really hard to get rid of

667
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,179
passwords on the I.T side but on the OT

668
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,400
side because some of it so much of it is

669
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,860
based on physical process and people

670
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,260
being at places we should have been

671
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,799
beyond passwords a long time ago and we

672
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,080
can do that actually in OT so OT should

673
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,460
have been the first one to get rid of

674
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,640
passwords no more passwords please kill

675
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
the password right

676
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,400
um knowing what I know about rainbow

677
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,380
tables and I'm sure everybody that's on

678
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,000
this cyber security conference has done

679
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,520
that before and done their ceh and done

680
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,620
a brute and and knows exactly what's

681
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,380
involved in it how easy it is to do

682
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,940
please there's just no protecting

683
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,220
against passwords and user user

684
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,200
identities before your identity should

685
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,299
have been a token a long time ago and we

686
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,500
should be using something else other

687
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,940
than passwords having a personal

688
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,220
passphrase as fine as part of

689
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,020
multi-factor but it shouldn't be the

690
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,059
primary and unfortunately right now we

691
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,140
use it as primary because almost

692
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,820
everybody uses some sort of hashing

693
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,500
algorithm and then they encrypt

694
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,659
afterwards right so

695
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,400
um you know we just got to get beyond

696
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,039
that especially in the OT world we can

697
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,659
be the first to get to it even before it

698
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,240
and call that a win on our side because

699
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,220
we were the first ones to get rid of it

700
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,919
the second bad thing is bringing it

701
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,520
systems into OT this is something yeah I

702
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,020
know everybody's like well wait what do

703
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,400
you do you know how do you get the data

704
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,500
how do you make an application how do

705
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,820
you get the data out of out of these

706
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,279
IEDs and bring them into the human

707
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,320
processing world because the one big

708
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,700
thing the other big thing difference

709
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,340
between it and OT is simply

710
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,100
that um usually when you're talking OT

711
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,960
and you're O2 protocols it's a

712
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,120
machine to machine only there's no going

713
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,580
up and down a TCP stack there's no

714
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,679
layers an Osa protocol if there are

715
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,600
layers you can follow the Purdue and

716
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,039
Purdue really the important stuff only

717
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,500
goes up to three in the same exact way

718
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,380
the most important stuff in OT only goes

719
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,820
up to three and back down again because

720
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,740
it's machine to machine talking to each

721
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,179
other and that's one of the reasons why

722
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,640
some of those OT cyber security systems

723
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,080
like one of the companies I used to work

724
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,919
for

725
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,360
um had one of them

726
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,460
um is basically some people call them an

727
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,600
industrial IDs that makes me you know

728
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,100
cringe again because it's not it's a

729
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,960
it's an in bad does anybody else know

730
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,360
that term in bad Network Behavior

731
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,059
anomaly detection engine

732
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,039
so it's one of the things that we

733
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,799
attempted to do very early on in the Sim

734
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,720
um you can do a little bit of it with uh

735
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,059
some of the better Sims out there

736
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,100
um that uh that do this but it's more of

737
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,419
a reactive thing because a lot of the

738
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,520
stuff's built on syslog

739
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,340
um Deepak inspection gives you that

740
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,740
instantaneous situation uh not that you

741
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,299
don't need correlation and maybe even

742
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,039
causation of the back if you can get it

743
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,080
in the background from your sim and

744
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,760
you've got your your playbooks and

745
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
workbooks done very well back there you

746
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,240
could probably get from point A to point

747
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,159
B A lot better than you might even be

748
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,240
able to get to with some of these in

749
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,100
bats but these impacts give you a good

750
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,399
idea of what's going on behaviorally in

751
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,500
the network and where you can sort out

752
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,899
the anomalies and and easily because

753
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:43,200
tuning a Sim is maybe 10 to what it's at

754
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,820
least two one to two orders of magnitude

755
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,100
harder than tuning one of these nbats

756
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,559
especially if you're a domain

757
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,020
um expert for the inbat with the embed

758
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,580
is doing so if you're a domain expert in

759
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,620
OT it's much easier to tune it sometimes

760
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,820
it's almost even Child's Play for

761
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,100
someone of the the smarter people out

762
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,360
there that you see me talking to

763
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,220
occasionally on LinkedIn because they

764
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,960
know you know stuff about memory

765
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,419
registers and programming plc's and

766
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,679
whether or not something is in run mode

767
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,260
versus versus program mode and things

768
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,340
along those lines and those are the

769
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,960
things you can see with those embeds so

770
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,460
the inbats actually work a heck of a lot

771
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,620
better for OT because of the

772
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,600
repeatability of the process it over and

773
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,799
over and over again things aren't

774
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,960
supposed to change uh one of the the

775
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,419
things that people fight in the IT world

776
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:27,179
as opposed to the OT World

777
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,500
um and this is where the OT people kind

778
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,960
of laugh at them is that um uh they have

779
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,980
something called cut and paste

780
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,419
networking and I don't know if anybody's

781
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,220
ever heard of that term before but cut

782
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,480
Pace networking is one of these things

783
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,480
where because something is Six Sigma or

784
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,159
lean base right which is something you

785
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,840
do something using the process called

786
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,179
Kaizen which is this incremental change

787
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,279
to get better all the time analyzing the

788
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,260
process and getting the errors out of it

789
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,880
and making the process more repeatable

790
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,120
well because the processing is like that

791
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,039
especially on the manufacturing side Oil

792
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,039
and Gas Energy the water filtration

793
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,520
systems Renewables all of it's the same

794
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,260
where it's a repeatable process over and

795
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,120
over and over again to let the robots

796
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,919
kind of take care of the the drudgery

797
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,260
and make less mistakes because of that

798
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,880
there wants to be less mistakes in the

799
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,640
programming logic so what will happen is

800
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,620
um what had happened was you would take

801
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,960
a block of code out of something and

802
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,279
then cut and paste it into something

803
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,020
else and that block of code includes IP

804
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,059
addresses even Mac addresses so

805
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,440
sometimes the MAC address could be the

806
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,360
same in one plant in Germany and the

807
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,520
same plant in in Galveston and Texas

808
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,980
right so same logic same IP address

809
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,480
schemes even the same Mac addresses

810
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,399
sometimes because you have a lot of L2

811
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,460
going on in these OT protocols

812
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,960
um where they don't even go up to L3 to

813
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,640
get an IP address so when you want to do

814
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,700
uh any kind of asset management on the

815
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,260
wire or see what things are talking to

816
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,179
each other two objects can look almost

817
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,799
exactly like each other especially if

818
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,080
you don't use some some pretty deep

819
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,299
machine learning uh with a whole bunch

820
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,919
of of different

821
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,039
um uh aspects uh and variables actually

822
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,260
inside of your your ml

823
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,279
um so so this bad thing bleeding it into

824
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,600
OT is one of the biggest problems so how

825
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,740
do you get how do you get rid of that

826
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,840
right you know you know uh they don't

827
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,760
obviously mix very well because there's

828
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,200
two different ways to go thinking about

829
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,100
something

830
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,320
and I'll tell you

831
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
um here is the the answer is already

832
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,580
with us actually so this is the old way

833
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,919
where you have a lot of user space and I

834
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,539
mean user space those things where the

835
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,340
users have an incredible amount of power

836
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,440
it doesn't matter if it's Windows I've

837
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,820
got Windows a little bit but it's an

838
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,159
incredibly powerful operating system uh

839
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,640
Linux uh Mac OS which is is really just

840
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,980
freebie or BSD all over again Berkeley

841
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,720
systems development platform which is

842
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,580
not Linux and if you say that to the

843
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,500
wrong people they'll probably attack you

844
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,720
in the street so please don't do that

845
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,399
um but in these user space operating

846
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,919
systems is as safe or it's safe I take

847
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,720
that back it secures a lot of people try

848
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,220
to make them

849
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,539
um it's still in this incredibly

850
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,580
powerful user space that if you have

851
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,220
physical access to the user space most

852
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,600
likely you're going to be able to hack

853
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,799
into it and that's what the current

854
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,720
stack looks like inside operational

855
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,059
technology remember that that long tail

856
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,700
on the operational technology but at the

857
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,640
same time it's the fact that um you know

858
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,620
uh that this process has to be

859
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,779
repeatable so so it's just a different

860
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,000
Viewpoint of trying to keep things the

861
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,100
same but incrementally changing them and

862
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,960
not forklifting them to make things just

863
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,059
a little bit incrementally better

864
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,860
but we've we've already fixed that

865
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,659
problem in I.T that's the way it systems

866
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,100
were actually set up too before we got

867
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,679
something called the cloud right so now

868
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,080
the web browser which was posited I

869
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,039
think

870
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,539
you know actually the birth of them

871
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,720
maybe the birth of of Mosaic where they

872
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,220
said oh wait this thing is going to be

873
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,440
the new operating system browser is

874
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,880
going to be the new operating system and

875
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,960
then I heard it again I think from

876
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,580
Andrews and some other time after that

877
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,440
the answer is already with us is to get

878
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,960
the user space lower in the stack and

879
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,860
the thing that you have is the

880
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,600
presentation layer

881
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,640
is going to be the thing that isn't user

882
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,039
space anymore right there's no user

883
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,480
control there you're not logging into

884
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,399
Windows workstation clicking on a bunch

885
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,019
of things that controls logic directly

886
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,779
into the OT world you have to abstract

887
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:09,120
it again and create a space that is

888
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,220
actually no longer a user accessible or

889
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,320
have all the power that user space had

890
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,840
in it before so so the future is upon us

891
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,240
you see a lot more of this in the iiot

892
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,519
which is similar to iot where you have

893
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:23,100
that web server or layer and some of it

894
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,899
now has API layers and stuff like that

895
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,580
where you can build browser applications

896
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,860
essentially on top of the API so that's

897
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,840
that's it we see a little bit in the iot

898
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,519
world but the iot is such a brittle

899
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,559
stack even more brittle than the

900
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,059
programmable logic controllers that came

901
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,820
before it we're still dealing with some

902
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,620
of that brittleness that came for it so

903
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,820
it got a little bit of a bad name

904
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,500
initially as it should have because it

905
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,299
was when it was in there it wasn't as

906
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,220
powerful it needed to be and and we used

907
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,860
we we reused something too much you know

908
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,019
when you when you have a GMO plant and

909
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,880
it does something very very well I'm not

910
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,799
going to pick on corn but that'd be one

911
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,299
of the good examples all of a sudden you

912
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,580
have corn blight or banana blight and

913
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,380
because that banana was so strong and so

914
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,600
widely used all of a sudden bananas go

915
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,519
away for a while until we can find a new

916
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,140
type of one that goes on well the same

917
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,120
way there was a lot of operating systems

918
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,700
that were you re-utilized very heavily

919
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,340
in some of these spaces where they group

920
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,740
light they you know had some problems

921
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,360
because over time these things

922
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,519
organically happen both in cyber

923
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,580
security as well as you know bacteria

924
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,559
and viruses it's just the way it goes so

925
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,240
the the use of the word virus is

926
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,200
actually

927
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,059
I think the only thing we haven't coined

928
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,820
yet in in um in in uh this sort of thing

929
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,980
yet is the bacteria we we actually need

930
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,200
a cyber bacteria and I think that that

931
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,519
somebody needs to go ahead and coin that

932
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,279
phrase right now and and and and and

933
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,659
um and come up with it and to that

934
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,240
degree there is bacteria out there it

935
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,760
grows and sometimes it's good for us and

936
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,860
and previously that was in the previous

937
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,519
step that I showed up which was um OPC

938
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,220
which uh which were originally well now

939
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,200
it stands for open platform connect and

940
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,519
it's really about getting this

941
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,500
distributed com model from Windows and

942
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,200
which is a way to to do uh distributed

943
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,640
information basically back into a

944
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,559
database to be able to sort it and store

945
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,300
it which is exactly what you need to be

946
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,739
able to do very quickly with your data

947
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,619
and so RPC was a great back in the day

948
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,300
nowadays because of this new Cloud stack

949
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,639
we really don't need that layer anymore

950
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,739
we can actually do it either over API or

951
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,540
some people use an mqtt and things like

952
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,760
that so that's some of the bacteria we

953
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,918
see still going around the craft we

954
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,960
really don't need it just like we don't

955
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,119
need passwords that's sort of cyber

956
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,980
security bacteria as well it was good

957
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,719
for a while now it stuck around for too

958
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,000
long and it is no good for us anymore so

959
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,800
now it's time to start cleaning it up a

960
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
little bit and getting rid of it right

961
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,300
and the same way we see malware going

962
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,460
more to the agile field and waterfall

963
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,040
style defenses are no longer going to

964
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,739
work and waterfall style defense is the

965
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,560
the idea that um we had this moat

966
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,899
situation uh that we had before and

967
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,280
people call it defense and depth and

968
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,320
there's some some really great stuff in

969
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,640
defense and depth I won't see you yeah

970
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,320
you get rid of it but you may need to be

971
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,579
able to change the defense in depth to

972
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,680
start hunting proactively and that's

973
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,500
where really where I see the agility The

974
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,119
Blue Team coming in is when we start

975
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,880
doing these crazy proactive hunts saying

976
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,500
hey we see a threat after doing this

977
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,240
let's go and try to not just do it to

978
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,119
ourselves using purple teaming but also

979
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,200
to

980
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,760
um you know to have the blue team say

981
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,920
hey look as we're going going you know

982
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,599
going in and doing this thing this

983
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,000
supposed threat on the environment

984
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,040
um you know at the same time

985
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,260
can The Blue Team defend very quickly on

986
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,240
on the whole thing and so I've seen

987
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,880
people use stuff like Gan crab and and

988
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,140
DNS and if you don't want to use

989
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,339
something that's actually more virus

990
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,980
driven you can use dnscat and iodine

991
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,900
internally to actually see if you can

992
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,000
exfiltrate any kind of data out of your

993
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,980
system so it's almost the bottom-up

994
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,079
approach to the whole thing so I've seen

995
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,000
a lot of that change

996
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,980
um at least in the Cyber defense

997
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,420
um quite a bit and that kind of leads us

998
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,460
to sort of the last aspect of where

999
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,960
we're failing in this whole thing now

1000
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,060
here goes more Pearl clutching and I'm

1001
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,020
going to say something that's going to

1002
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,640
be pretty challenging to a lot of cyber

1003
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,300
security practitioners out there please

1004
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,940
for all that is Holy do the God's work

1005
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,520
and please kill syslog please let's get

1006
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,900
rid of it already there is already an

1007
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,000
answer to it people are using it very

1008
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,339
effectively remember that whole API

1009
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,480
thing that I was talking about before

1010
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,900
web Hook is so easy and so light

1011
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,780
um and it gives uh data tagging

1012
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,420
capabilities and and selectiveness on it

1013
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,040
and everything else like that webhook is

1014
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,320
here and it's here to stay please let's

1015
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,480
go ahead and kills us live because I'll

1016
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,980
tell you right now lots of people

1017
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,599
complain about how much Bitcoin and

1018
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,040
Bitcoin mining takes up in the

1019
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,020
electricity I will tell you right now

1020
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,079
given any single day of the year syslog

1021
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,740
takes anywhere between 2 to 10 x of all

1022
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,040
crypto coins ever mined a day is spent

1023
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,720
on syslog

1024
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,460
um and that's in your iot stuff it's

1025
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,520
your firewalls it's in everything right

1026
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,099
um so killing it would actually give us

1027
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,800
a whole lot of electricity back uh just

1028
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,200
in general by just instituting web Hooks

1029
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,820
and actually making all that stuff uh

1030
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,520
operational so because not only CPU

1031
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,400
spent to create syslog but to ingest it

1032
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,859
and then to go store it somewhere and

1033
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,200
then you haven't even made you've spent

1034
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,940
at least three CPU Cycles on this thing

1035
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,560
and you haven't even made any sense of

1036
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,660
it yet so gosh knows you got to go make

1037
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,579
sense of it now and that takes a whole

1038
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,020
bunch of stuff to actually make make

1039
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,300
sense of of syslog and actually know how

1040
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,040
to correlate you know different syslog

1041
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,240
messages and everything else like that

1042
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,920
and try to get to something that's

1043
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,020
actually human legible and maybe human

1044
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,780
human understandable right so you know

1045
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,020
in syslog where where it was you know

1046
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,359
probably possible to get rid of an I.T

1047
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,000
OT is so much farther behind on this so

1048
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,280
much of your billing if you've got a

1049
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,680
smart meter on the back of your house it

1050
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,060
develops this log they go back to a

1051
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,260
smart meter that gets collected

1052
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,660
somewhere locally in a substation that

1053
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,099
gets pulled up over the wire and then

1054
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,680
you have your billing so even Billings

1055
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,020
based on syslog uh to some degree

1056
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,880
depending on which Which smart metering

1057
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,619
system your Electrical Company is using

1058
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,280
so um so you know even that is is not

1059
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,020
exactly the most secure thing in the

1060
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,880
entire planet and one of the reasons why

1061
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,800
everybody complained initially one of

1062
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,060
the reasons why they complain initially

1063
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,339
about smart metering is it wasn't secure

1064
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,140
is because it was essentially using

1065
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,900
syslog to grab the data out of out of

1066
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,760
the the entire property or the ecosystem

1067
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,700
itself so so these are where on the OT

1068
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,640
side both on the you know the usage of

1069
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,060
and then the securing of we're not doing

1070
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,400
ourselves Justice because we can move

1071
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,980
the ball along there's these three holy

1072
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,780
things that are held up unfortunately

1073
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,720
which are passwords user space operating

1074
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,359
systems to make things work and then the

1075
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,359
use of syslog to unfortunately secure a

1076
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,099
lot of what we've got going on if we

1077
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,780
were able to transform those into

1078
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,240
something new we might get to that next

1079
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,359
level that we're all really pining for

1080
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,400
um when it comes to defense of critical

1081
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,220
infrastructure so that's really my talk

1082
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,119
today

1083
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,560
um hopefully it was informative and I've

1084
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,200
left enough time for questions so and

1085
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,140
I'm going to unshare real quick unless I

1086
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,420
want to talk about a slide

1087
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,240
now we're all good uh Brian you got

1088
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,560
anything

1089
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,480
and thank you and I know that we had

1090
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
problems at the beginning you you

1091
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,740
squeezed we don't need to introduce the

1092
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,480
next stop for another minute and a half

1093
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,000
so you just made it in any questions go

1094
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,220
ahead Brian I'll watch I just said I

1095
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,180
didn't see any questions but I thought

1096
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,500
that was that was a pretty fascinating

1097
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,380
uh insight into your into your line of

1098
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,940
work and the things that you're

1099
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,980
concerned about and want to see changed

1100
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,420
uh there's there's a little discussion

1101
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,320
going on there on the Discord

1102
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,119
I can't wait to see it I'll pop in

1103
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,099
because uh I like throwing that stone

1104
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,380
into the the Placid Waters of cyber

1105
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,579
security because we've got we can all

1106
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:54,839
agree on a whole lot of things but when

1107
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,720
you start talking about the the things

1108
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,579
that you know people you know make their

1109
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,800
money on and do things with and it's

1110
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,180
really the core value of what it is

1111
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,579
challenging something like that is not

1112
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,400
easy and I and I challenge a lot uh I

1113
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,680
actually think that because iot should

1114
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,720
have charged way farther into containers

1115
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,420
and Cloud stuff and left the actual

1116
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,099
interconnectivity of the cloud behind

1117
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,380
don't put the internet in it but I think

1118
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,700
they should have caught charged very

1119
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,839
quickly forward in the cloud

1120
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,980
infrastructure and putting Cloud

1121
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,200
infrastructure on premises a long time

1122
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,520
ago to get rid of the user space

1123
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,200
environments that they currently have

1124
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,180
and then that way they could have been a

1125
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,099
hell a lot more secure at least the

1126
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,619
ephemerality of it and the mutability of

1127
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,599
the the things when you interact with

1128
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,700
machines would have been a hell of a lot

1129
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,619
better than it is now right now there's

1130
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,180
there's a lot of variability which which

1131
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,740
causes all the problems that we have

1132
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,979
today

1133
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,780
thanks guys

1134
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,880
this is great James appreciate it thanks

1135
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,859
so much it's great to hear and watch

1136
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:53,660
your talk
