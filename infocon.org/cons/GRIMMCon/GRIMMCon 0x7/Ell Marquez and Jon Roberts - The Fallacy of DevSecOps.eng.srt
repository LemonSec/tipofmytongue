1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:01:02,719
[Music]

2
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,220
so

3
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:27,200
[Music]

4
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,320
so the fallacy of

5
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,320
devsecops today uh

6
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,400

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,600

13
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,200

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,399
how did you guys

16
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,719
get into cyber security and how did you

17
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,439
pair up like what was this what stemmed

18
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,158
into this talk

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,479
is that the loudest one right

20
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,360
yeah i'll kick it off uh so i am the

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,400
perpetual over uh what is it volunteer

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
and i found out there was a group called

23
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,480
uh san antonio devs out here in san

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,840
antonio and they were trying to get

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
stuff going and they were one of the

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
more active groups

27
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,959
so i was just like hey i'm l i don't

28
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
know how to dev i don't know how to code

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
but i think it would be fun to you know

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,760
to learn to do some new things can i

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,599
hang out with you all and then they said

32
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,120
yeah we're gonna have like lunch at this

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
place and that was food in san antonio

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,440
and me so i was there like actually on

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360
time which y'all know how rare that is

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
um

37
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,319
that's really just the beginning of a

38
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,879
beautiful thing and i met john because

39
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,720
and we're gonna go into some of the talk

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,640
and i i love that what we're following

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
up next or what we're following up

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,319
because this is a bit of a little bit of

43
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,680
a different spin on it with my

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,160
experience of the hostilities that could

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,840
be around some devs and some set

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
communities so how open everyone there

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,480
was and how john would sit down and when

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,680
i said something have an actual

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,239
conversation with me instead of oh well

50
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,879
actually or let me set you straight or

51
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,400
you know let me bring down the hand of

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
god on you um definitely help me just

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,760
want to spur you know things on so yeah

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,800
that was

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
that never happens

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,239
i don't know what john's view of

57
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,440
everything was but that's how it went

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,920
down on my side

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,800
yeah

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
john i got a question for l real quick

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
so i'm curious l uh are you do you

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
consider yourself an introvert or an

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,080
extrovert

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,640
it depends um l i'm like which i'm

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,239
trying to get out of right now is a

66
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,640
complete and utter introvert i oh my god

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
i will get off this call and go hide on

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,760
the couch and think about everything i

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
said right but when i present i put on

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,319
this persona hey i'm ello punk and

71
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,000
i'm gonna be who i am and i'm gonna tell

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
you what i think and we'll pay the price

73
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
later

74
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,200
i was curious because that's uh what you

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,959
described your start right like hey i'm

76
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,959
hell i want to do this that's that's

77
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,040
difficult for introverts right and uh so

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,959
that's why i was curious to know that so

79
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,319
thank you for sharing that john sorry

80
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,640
for interrupting gutsy yeah absolutely

81
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,680
go ahead john

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,080
yeah no in in that particular community

83
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
we work really hard to make it a

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,159
welcoming place and and do that

85
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,239
uh but it's also a place where on some

86
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,680
of the channels we actually set up

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
specific channels in our online

88
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
community that it's like this is a place

89
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
where you can go vent about things that

90
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,279
are bothering you

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,800
and uh

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,880
so my focus is not security my focus

93
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,560
for most of my career has been software

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
development so security is one part of

95
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,360
that from my perspective but that's not

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,600
where my professional focus has been so

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
that's the whole reason that l invited

98
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,199
me into the talk is to give everyone a

99
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,440
different perspective and today we're

100
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,160
speaking primarily to

101
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,919
the security side of the house security

102
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
professionals so that's kind of i'll be

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
talking a little bit more than l because

104
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
i have more to share with them from the

105
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,080
dev side but we've talked about this is

106
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,919
great content it's it's really good

107
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,759
stuff and we may be giving this talk to

108
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,240
other audiences or making it longer and

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,000
that's a place where l would be speaking

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
a lot more from the security perspective

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
about you know you guys think we're

112
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
asking for this but we actually mean

113
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
this and you know we should both want

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,039
that right you know so

115
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,440
uh but one of the things elle told me

116
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,199
that she noticed and the reason she came

117
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
up with this talk

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,759
is that in the the some of the channels

119
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,520
where we gripe about things she saw

120
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,000
security being cracked about a lot

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,320
by developers and that's like

122
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
wow there's a disconnect because we

123
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
should all want the same thing so what's

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
happening here and that that was kind of

125
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,840
the genesis of this talk and when she

126
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
reached out to me awesome well why don't

127
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
we let you take it away since you're

128
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,479
limited on time we'll we'll pick it up

129
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,479
at the end and hopefully have some more

130
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,240
awesome conversation

131
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
thank you

132
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
it's gonna be great um i'm already

133
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
making the newbie mistake so we're just

134
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,440
gonna flow with it cause i totally

135
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
forgot to open speaker notes so whatever

136
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
slide is on the thing is what's on the

137
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,639
thing but we're gonna be talking anyways

138
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,759
so

139
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,199
welcome everyone thank you for joining

140
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,520
us in the fallacy of devsecops as i said

141
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,360
it was a quite interesting experience

142
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,560
that we were going to be following up

143
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
the keynote i wish i'd gotten to see

144
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,280
more of it because i know that we are

145
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
going to touch a lot on the same um

146
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,560
topics i will say that i am probably at

147
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,720
this part lopunk is not playing the nice

148
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,639
guy i am going to just put things out

149
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,919
the way that they are the way that i've

150
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,360
heard them sometimes i will come out

151
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
brash sometimes i will come out rude but

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
guess what that's the reality of what

153
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,600
i'm seeing out there in the community so

154
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
i should introduce myself though if i

155
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,039
know how to use slides apparently you're

156
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,240
going to introduce yourself first so

157
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
never mind see no speaker notes

158
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,600
so so like i said i've been doing this

159
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
i've been doing this uh development for

160
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,960
a while

161
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,520
i've interfaced with security a lot over

162
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,720
my career

163
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
and it's interesting because different

164
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
organizations have different priorities

165
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,800
they have different cultures been

166
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,479
working with products and companies at

167
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,400
different stages of development

168
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,120
and uh what you're doing with your your

169
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
team and your product and your company

170
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
and what you're doing with security is

171
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,400
different at all of those

172
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
so some of the stories we'll share will

173
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,639
be from specific points and times and

174
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,199
places in those companies so don't over

175
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,560
extrapolate

176
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,960
just focus on uh you know the core theme

177
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
not that this thing happened i can just

178
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,199
take this story and do it so i'm at

179
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,440
boston homes now and we have also have a

180
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,080
product called porch pass that we are on

181
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,039
the cusp of uh general release

182
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,360
and uh i will tell you if you are having

183
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,319
trouble finding a home to buy

184
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
in this market today

185
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
uh check us out especially if you're in

186
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,319
texas or new mexico

187
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,000
and uh it's

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,800
it's

189
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,199
i never thought i would find myself at

190
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,520
this place in my career

191
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,039
but at a certain point i realized that i

192
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,039
had done more work like ford than

193
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,319
ferrari and that most software is about

194
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,560
enablement and not about software for

195
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,199
other software developers and so i

196
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,720
really appreciate you having me here to

197
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160

198
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
and uh if you like my my graphics my new

199
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599

time i've got the slides going so now

203
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,599
i'll know where we're going all right so

204
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,400
as i've said a few times hey i'm elle

205
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,759
and um yeah i am a security trainer it's

206
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,759
actually senior technical trainer here

207
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,160
at grimm we forgot that part

208
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,440
and i have spent the last year yelling

209
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,559
at developers um i spent the last year

210
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
going across the world actually a few

211
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
countries in here talking to developers

212
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,479
about how badly they treat us in

213
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,958
security how ill will they have towards

214
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,760
us why they ignore us and just taking

215
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,600
all of the comments and feedback that

216
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
i've heard from the security community

217
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,040
and going and laying it at their feet

218
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
only to finally

219
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,040
get quiet and listen to them and hear

220
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,959
what they're saying and that's how this

221
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,560
talk came about and why i'm presenting

222
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,720
with john today as i'm going back and

223
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,200
pushing on him finally i learned that i

224
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,360
just needed to be quiet and ask well you

225
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,240
know what is it that i'm missing so i'm

226
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
hoping that that's what we're all going

227
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
to do here today is we're all just going

228
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,920
to be a little quiet we're going to

229
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
listen and we're going to take in some

230
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
words of wisdom because the first thing

231
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,320
that we're going to be talking about is

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,720
the current state of devsecops the

233
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,200
current state to me is exactly what i've

234
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,040
been saying you know i hear over and

235
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
over and over that we're treated as

236
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,680
second-hand citizens you know security

237
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,839
never comes first that security is

238
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,760
always an afterthought i've heard the

239
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,920
statistic that 70 of vulnerabilities are

240
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,240
in the application level so many times

241
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,720
as justification to what's actually

242
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
happening with these breaches like it's

243
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,839
not security's fault we're not even in

244
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,440
control of it the devs are ignoring us

245
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
they're not listening and it it's

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,560
created a culture that has gotten in my

247
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
opinion out of hand i had the talk

248
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
actually with my manager i know he's

249
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
watching i'm gonna throw him under the

250
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
bus where he goes uh you know i just i

251
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
don't like your view right now that you

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,800
have of this war that's going on and i

253
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
more i think about it the more that i

254
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
become entrenched in it like yes that's

255
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,079
what i'm seeing that's what i'm doing

256
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,160
and so i'm wondering john lin you know

257
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,519
can you tell us on your side of the

258
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,040
house what you're seeing you know how

259
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,160
are things looking over there

260
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
yeah over here i will tell you that we

261
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,920
have enormous pressure from a lot of

262
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,600
different directions

263
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,040
and uh

264
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,640
one of the things if you're a new

265
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,399
product development especially if you're

266
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,880
in an earlier stage company or a company

267
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,040
that's that's rapidly growing

268
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,519
that's that's compounded

269
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,839
and

270
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,240
the perspective is

271
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
i'm graded on did we ship

272
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,000
so the the primary constituency a lot of

273
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
these teams are looking at in an agile

274
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,079
way of working which is how most

275
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,440
companies are trying to do things

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
nowadays

277
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,800
is are we shipping the features that we

278
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
promised are we sending things to

279
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,760
marketing

280
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
and the

281
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
we'll talk some more we'll come back and

282
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,120
circle back to that about about how that

283
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,800
can affect what we're doing and why

284
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,040
we're doing it and how we work together

285
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,279
but that's what's going on in devworld

286
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,519
is i have

287
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,440
so many different things that i have to

288
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,839
do because i'm not just thinking about

289
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,000
can a security problem take me down i'm

290
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,480
thinking about can a load problem take

291
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
me down i'm thinking about can a

292
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,560
particular bug that interacts in a bad

293
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,360
way with another system take me down i'm

294
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
encountering those bugs i'm dealing with

295
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,519
a lot of different things so as a

296
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,480
developer

297
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,240
if you come in and you say here's my

298
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
checklist go do this thing

299
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,720
uh i'm not gonna look very

300
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
highly on that i'm gonna be like

301
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
what no that's not what i'm graded on

302
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,000
that's not what the ceo told me is the

303
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
most important thing right now so we

304
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,079
might get to that you know in a month or

305
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,120
two or three or two weeks or whatever

306
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
and uh it's

307
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,440
that's really not what anyone wants

308
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
because everyone on my team i always

309
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,519
have pride in what i do i don't want

310
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,440
there to be a security breach

311
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
but at the same time when i'm handed a

312
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
list of do all these things

313
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
i'm like there's no way

314
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
right

315
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,680
oh definitely

316
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,720
um

317
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
so i want to i've come i might even just

318
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,000
move things off the way but one of the

319
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
things that i wanted you to talk about

320
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,639
when you were talking about all these

321
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,959
things is what you taught me about was

322
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,120
wow that was a big long convoluted way

323
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,720
to get to this

324
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,240
was when you were speaking about

325
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,440
functional versus non-functional and

326
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
how i honestly never even heard of the

327
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,279
terms or why it was that you all would

328
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
be addressing things in that way

329
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,720
ah okay yeah if we so

330
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
yeah so i already mentioned agile

331
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,320
product management you guys have if

332
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,519
you've been doing this for a while

333
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,040
you've probably already run into some of

334
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,120
that and run into product managers and

335
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,440
stories and features and

336
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,920
you know how do we how do we prioritize

337
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,360
what we do

338
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
functional versus non-functional is an

339
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
interesting story though because back

340
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
when i

341
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,279
was a mid-level developer still early in

342
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,079
my career i worked at a large company

343
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:04,959
and i

344
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,800
i started at a smaller place went to a

345
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,399
slightly bigger place and went to a

346
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,639
really big place and when i went to the

347
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,959
really big place this was in the early

348
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,399
2000s

349
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,959
late 2000s early 2010s

350
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
we were still learning

351
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,680
that organization was still doing things

352
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,880
kind of

353
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,800
in an old school way and if you've ever

354
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
heard the term waterfall

355
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,639
when you do that type of development you

356
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,800
say we want to spec everything we can

357
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,720
before we start writing code and that's

358
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
not how most organizations do it

359
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,720
nowadays but it was interesting because

360
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,120
we had this non-functional

361
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,959
requirement list and that's where the

362
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,040
table stakes things like security that

363
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,440
it's like customers it's invisible to

364
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,880
customers they know they want it and

365
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,720
they know they need it and they know

366
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,800
things need to work but they don't think

367
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,560
about it and they don't ask for it

368
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,760
because

369
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
it's non-functional in other words

370
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
non-functional means it's not part of

371
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,079
the core function that i'm trying to do

372
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,000
it doesn't mean that it doesn't function

373
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,839
it just means that it's outside of the

374
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,199
core function that we're trying to

375
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,639
achieve

376
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,959
and so those things used to be covered

377
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,839
there

378
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,800
and

379
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,279
i'm not suggesting we go back to that

380
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,760
i'm just saying that it hasn't always

381
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,079
been this way uh but back then there

382
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,160
were less

383
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,680
if

384
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,839
things were less complex in some of the

385
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,360
ways that we did things there were more

386
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,079
homogeneous environments in some ways

387
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,199
and so uh for instance the

388
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,519
the percentage of software that was

389
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,600
composed of probably open source

390
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,680
packages from

391
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,959
uh packet just package management was

392
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,519
somewhat smaller now than it is then

393
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,320
right you know so

394
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
when you're covering that checklist and

395
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,480
non-functional requirements

396
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
industries less mature

397
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,199
less complexity less things you're gonna

398
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,800
we have less automation you're gonna

399
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,639
have a smaller list of non-functional

400
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,199
requirements and so now the stakes are

401
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,079
higher

402
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,920
table stakes are higher to get into the

403
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,880
game

404
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
but at the same time a lot of management

405
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,399
companies whatever with our agile

406
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,160
product management we're not treating it

407
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
that way we're not we're not asking

408
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
those questions the way we could

409
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,160
so

410
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,120
that kind of gives you a picture of

411
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,600
you know where we are where we are

412
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519
and we'll talk about where we can go uh

413
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,040
next i'm guessing

414
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
and uh i don't know why we put pay

415
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
premiums on security on this slide

416
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,720
because we probably want to talk about

417
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
that but i don't know if it makes sense

418
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,399
to talk about it right here

419
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,560
well you know no i think i will butt in

420
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
and make us talk about it here and the

421
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,839
way the reason we were talking about it

422
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,959
is

423
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,199
we've gotten to a point where we have

424
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,680
pushed away from you know having all

425
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,600
that functionality and having that be a

426
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,440
priority and so if we're going to go

427
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,040
back to it if we're going to find that

428
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,639
solution that middle ground is going to

429
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,959
be our transition that middle ground

430
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,920
into how can we be able to accomplish

431
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
effectively accomplish security

432
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,639
securities jobs security requirements

433
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,800
and still have developers be able to do

434
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,040
their day to day and the requirements is

435
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,480
going to be to have to find a way to pay

436
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
back that technical debt

437
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,600
to pay back what is owed and um

438
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
the product management side section here

439
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,399
is one of the things that i am seeing

440
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,079
the more and more and i i wish i could

441
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,759
have that kumbaya view everybody who

442
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,279
knows me knows that i love to just have

443
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,199
this calm you know just like i want

444
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,759
people to get along so bad but the more

445
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,199
that i learn the more that i see that

446
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,759
there seems to be almost like a a joint

447
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,600
enemy that we're facing

448
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,399
and

449
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,720
instead of combating that enemy together

450
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
and trying to find a solution we've just

451
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
started going over you know whose job is

452
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
more important to accomplish

453
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,759
so

454
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,600
the solution kind of came about when we

455
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,199
were talking and i was asking you this

456
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,959
and i'm saying you know i saw somebody

457
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,600
get on um on sa devs and just say you

458
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,360
know hey security came by they dropped

459
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
the pin test report on us they told us

460
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,720
just to do the needful they don't even

461
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
know how to use their own tools

462
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
i was like okay let's back up a moment

463
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,039
what just happened and the big thing

464
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,599
that i finally said is okay well what do

465
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,480
i need to do in order for you to and you

466
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,199
i said you but hopefully the royal you

467
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,720
be able to actually like help us out

468
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,240
getting things done and you said well

469
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,720
nobody ever answers the why

470
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,199
yeah and when i say you know what nobody

471
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,880
answers the why i'm not saying you know

472
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,520
why why would you do that so what is the

473
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,679
big why that your security is supposed

474
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
to be tackling instead of just well why

475
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,280
didn't you do it or why did you do that

476
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,760
yeah and that's that's

477
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,039
okay we might not always be uh

478
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,480
nice

479
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,960
and we might not always be smart but

480
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,360
most developers are intelligent

481
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
and so if you can connect to that

482
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,400
intelligence and say you know what

483
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,799
explain to them

484
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,240
oh that's bad

485
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,520
ask them

486
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,480
what they need first and ask them why

487
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,080
they haven't done something and they'll

488
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
tell you the story that we just told you

489
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,280
but

490
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
i guarantee you that if you're in a big

491
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,760
enough organization probably 100 to 200

492
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,080
people there is some enterprising young

493
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
developer that actually really cares

494
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,320
about security and they'd be your ally

495
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,559
if you can find them and and you could

496
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,720
teach them the why

497
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,160
and the why is

498
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,720
how

499
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,280
things can be vulnerable so that sounds

500
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,799
kind of twisted but it's like

501
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,720
if you're in development you're taught

502
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,840
hey i do oh wasp and i sanitize my sql

503
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,919
inputs and

504
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,799
i'm good you know uh i i might try to

505
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,760
make sure i use packages that are signed

506
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,600
and secure depending on your ecosystem

507
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,520
and i'm good

508
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,440
and

509
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,039
maybe there was a time when that made

510
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,720
sense and that was true but that's

511
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,559
that's not really true anymore it's like

512
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,720
there are other vectors like once you're

513
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,760
on a pass

514
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,960
cloud

515
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,120
how many vulnerabilities have come about

516
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,679
that were oh we didn't secure the azure

517
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,160
blob storage or the amazon s3 thing

518
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,400
correctly and stuff like that so as a

519
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
complexity of the environment has grown

520
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,799
the checklists have grown and there's

521
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,440
more stuff to do right so the why is

522
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,799
really

523
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,039
from a security point of view is why i'm

524
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,960
a developer why do i need to do all this

525
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,080
stuff the why is because

526
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,520
every single thing you have in your

527
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,080
system has a different vector right so

528
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
that's the why

529
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
and that's what you're you're wanting to

530
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
engage developers but if you don't

531
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,559
listen

532
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,400
they're not going to listen to you

533
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,919
if you don't understand where they're

534
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,919
coming from right

535
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,559
so that i'll hand that back to l to say

536
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,520
you know

537
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,160
okay so start with why why do i need to

538
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,760
do this checklist item well this is the

539
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
thing that'll happen if we don't and

540
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,919
that's the beginning of the conversation

541
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,520
right

542
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,679
guys and i think on the other end though

543
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,160
i push back to the devs and i have is

544
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
that you're all very quickly and yes i'm

545
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,919
speaking broad terms all right i'm not

546
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,760
going to speak for everyone but does

547
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
that i have interacted are very quick to

548
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
tell me why i'm wrong

549
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,440
uh why i don't understand it why if i

550
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,120
don't know how to code i shouldn't do it

551
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
so i would push that you know what

552
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
devs and security both need to say you

553
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
know how can we help we both have a job

554
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,039
that needs to get done we both are under

555
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,640
crime constraints i don't think anyone

556
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
is going to say that the other isn't

557
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,480
probably just bombarded with tasks that

558
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,840
they are not going to get to finish in

559
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
the amount of time that they have so as

560
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,640
a part of how can we help

561
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,120
it becomes part of the why so if i go to

562
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,720
you and i say look

563
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,760
you have you know 15 vulnerabilities in

564
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,400
this code that we're seeing why hasn't

565
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,240
this been addressed

566
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,280
well perhaps it's because what security

567
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,120
doesn't understand the vulnerabilities

568
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,039
they are facing why are there you see i

569
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,480
can see really quickly when i say it

570
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,799
that way how the hostility starts like

571
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,400
who is it that isn't understanding um so

572
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,159
as a security person i'm gonna come up

573
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,960
to you with these issues how can i help

574
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,640
why what is the best way for me to

575
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,799
approach you with this instead of you

576
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,640
know just the language itself makes it

577
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
seem almost hostile

578
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,760
right and

579
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,720
and crazily enough there's a reason we

580
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
let in talking about like agile product

581
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
management and product owners and things

582
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,080
like that

583
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,360
and um

584
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,280
if we can go ahead and

585
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
jump up another slide or two

586
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,440
the uh

587
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,360
that i went with one too many there you

588
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,400
go we still don't know how to go back

589
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,760
ah just keep going it'll be fine

590
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,679
but there's actually a word for this in

591
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,000
japanese if you study lean

592
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,080
uh they they talk about three types of

593
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,039
waste

594
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,600
and the one that's often not

595
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,679
covered by companies and that is talked

596
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,440
about the least and is actually the most

597
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
pernicious in my opinion

598
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,559
is one called murray and yuri means that

599
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,640
you have system overload and what it

600
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,120
means is you're throwing so many things

601
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
at a certain part of your organization

602
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,559
or certain part of your system that it

603
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,880
can't handle them and when that happens

604
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,039
in like the technical realm we recognize

605
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,200
oh that could be a ddos attack or we

606
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,039
just had a spike on christmas day or

607
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,360
whatever the system got overwhelmed but

608
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
when it happens in people's systems

609
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
it seems like a lot of times the

610
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
attitude is just we'll just buck up and

611
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,840
do it all as part of the job well that's

612
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,480
great except people are finite and we

613
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,559
only have so much bandwidth

614
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,400
so what you're looking at here is to say

615
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,360
ah

616
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,159
wait

617
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,640
if i talk to dev they tell me

618
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,559
who they're working for they tell me

619
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,880
who's prioritizing their work

620
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,039
so if i go in and i talk to a dev team

621
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,799
or i talk to a lead dev or i say do the

622
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,400
needful

623
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,080
i'm not actually talking to the person

624
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,159
that prioritizes the work i do need to

625
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,600
talk with them because we need to

626
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
understand that why together so that we

627
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,760
can figure out how to achieve this

628
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,520
common goal together so i do need to

629
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,679
talk to them but i also

630
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,440
need to talk to

631
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
the product manager or the engineering

632
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,480
manager

633
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,039
or the whoever is driving the priorities

634
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,600
for that team and

635
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
90 of the time sometimes it won't

636
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,760
sometimes it'll be someone on the team

637
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,280
that's filling that role and doing

638
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
development i've seen that in cases and

639
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
talked to someone recently about a team

640
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,919
where they had someone there it's a

641
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,000
product for developers by developers and

642
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
they're able to do that themselves

643
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,159
but 90 of the time that's not the case

644
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,840
there's someone out there that's driving

645
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
priority so

646
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
if you can get in with a product manager

647
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,760
and say look

648
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,919
i know that your customers aren't asking

649
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,280
for it but they expect it they expect

650
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
our app they expect our service to be

651
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,120
secure

652
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,000
so let's figure out how to put security

653
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,720
hardening on your product roadmap

654
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
and so that other people in the

655
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,240
organization are aware that we're

656
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,559
spending resources on this

657
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,039
and that we're actually have time to

658
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,799
allocate on the development team to get

659
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,400
these things done

660
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,640
and that could be milestones it just

661
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
depends on your industry it depends on

662
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,159
your situation it depends on what you're

663
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,919
doing it could be that we reach a

664
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,480
certain level security

665
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,279
certification it could be that you know

666
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,279
we've we've tested and hardened these

667
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,600
aspects of the app or whatever and those

668
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
things might circulate internally they

669
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,600
might be told to the customer that hey

670
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,120
we've improved the security of the

671
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,600
application you're using or whatever

672
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,480
but

673
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,960
that's the place to go is not just to

674
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,640
think about oh i need to hand this to

675
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,480
the lead dev or the architect or the dev

676
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,159
teams and it's my job to go make sure

677
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,799
they get this done find an ally over in

678
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,880
management or in product management

679
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,000
because we all want the same thing but

680
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
our focus is different and if you can

681
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,559
work that into the product roadmap

682
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,799
you're going to get it that will allow

683
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,039
you to free up developer time to work us

684
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,720
work on the things that you're looking

685
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,799
at

686
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,400
you've also worked on the manager side

687
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,840
of house right you're currently you know

688
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,600
in that role and i you know already

689
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,039
teased our next slide because i don't

690
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,840
know how to click buttons but um yeah i

691
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,640
how realistic is this i i mean you're

692
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,919
telling me all these great things that i

693
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,279
could do and it would be great if i

694
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,440
could go and but now i've become an

695
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,600
internal salesman instead of doing on

696
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
top of doing my security job i now also

697
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,760
have to go and sell you on doing this

698
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,840
and get to unite management it seems

699
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,679
like we're even adding

700
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,600
more to our scarcity of time issue um so

701
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
practicality and what you've been doing

702
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,480
and the companies that you worked at

703
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,080
that you've taken leadership like how

704
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,840
realistic is what we're we're telling

705
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
people to do

706
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,000
so this this actually dives a little bit

707
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,320
into career advancement in most

708
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,840
companies and most organizations

709
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,559
and

710
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,679
what we're

711
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,919
what i'm saying is not

712
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,159
that soft skills and working with other

713
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,440
people

714
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,279
trumps competence or you don't need to

715
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
be technically competent

716
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,200
technical competence is a baseline it's

717
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,120
table stakes you can't do what we're

718
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,480
saying to do if you're not technically

719
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,120
competent but what i am saying is if you

720
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,000
want to get things done with any group

721
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,440
of people this could be a

722
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
outside of work in work i've put

723
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,279
together basketball teams for the first

724
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,279
time in my life in the past six months

725
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,200
and it's been a lot of fun but gosh it's

726
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,320
hard wrangling stuff right

727
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,880
those skills what we're telling you is

728
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,679
to learn how to empathize and to learn

729
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,559
how to find a common why and to connect

730
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,960
and to learn how to prioritize and say

731
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,799
oh because i tell you what that product

732
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,640
manager wants this finished thing but

733
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,840
they got to figure out what's most

734
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,600
important and do that part first you

735
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,440
have to do the same thing

736
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,039
so what we're not saying is that

737
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,919
technical competence isn't important

738
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,760
what i thought when i was young in my

739
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,520
career is i thought if i am the most

740
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
technically competent i will climb the

741
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,880
highest and i will have the brightest

742
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,039
star and i will get the most plum things

743
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,679
to work on i will have the coolest stuff

744
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,760
and the only ladder i was looking at was

745
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
technical competence

746
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
and what i found out after failing and

747
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
failing and failing to get past a

748
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,400
certain point was that wow technical

749
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,760
competence matters but when you pair it

750
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,000
with these soft skills

751
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,080
that's where the rubber meets the road

752
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,240
and that's where you get traction for

753
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,080
your technical competence

754
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,960
um

755
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,480
there are rare cases where there's

756
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,399
someone who's super super super bright

757
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,799
and you have that brilliant a-hole that

758
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,480
makes something work and everyone has to

759
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,799
work around them but in most cases

760
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,480
that's not most organizations that's

761
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
probably not actually your organization

762
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,000
it may be happening that doesn't mean it

763
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,279
should happen

764
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,559
but your technical competence is

765
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,080
is important

766
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,760
but if you want to release the power of

767
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,360
that technical competence you're going

768
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,720
to have to do that through some

769
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,320
influence and some sales and some

770
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,559
empathy in your organization

771
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,960
and as a young person i hated hearing

772
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,320
that

773
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
and now as an old person i will tell you

774
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,480
i hate telling you that

775
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,039
because it kind of shatters this idea of

776
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,279
hey i'm good i'm awesome i can make a

777
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,399
difference just because i have these

778
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,240
skills it's like oh my gosh i have to

779
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,080
get more skills to release the power of

780
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,919
these skills

781
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,000
yes and that's awful because that's the

782
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,159
story of life i have kids in their 20s

783
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,679
and kids and their teens and i've had to

784
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,080
have this conversation over and over

785
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,720
and it sucks but once you get past it

786
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
and you accept it it's like

787
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,520
wow it's hard but it's worth it when you

788
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,880
have an ally and you accomplish

789
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,960
something together it's all that much

790
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,600
more sweeter than saying i did this to

791
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,639
say we did this

792
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,679
i know that you and i could talk about

793
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,000
this for for just ever because first of

794
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,279
all i just like to talk and you're a

795
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,760
storyteller but i we only have a limited

796
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,520
amount of time so one thing that we did

797
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
is we put together we're gonna just

798
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,279
break it down really simply for people

799
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,880
to understand what kind of allies they

800
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,679
can do so on the development team i

801
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,520
would say and we can both go back and

802
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,880
forth on this that for on the

803
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
development team i would tell people in

804
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,039
security don't just always approach the

805
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,960
the lead developer and for that i mean i

806
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,240
don't mean go to your junior developers

807
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,679
and ask them to do things i mean take

808
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,159
your juno developer to lunch i mean form

809
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,480
connections with those because

810
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,919
you don't always want to be the guy that

811
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,760
only shows up to say why didn't you do

812
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
this how could you not do this if you

813
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,360
already have those connections reaching

814
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,520
out to someone and saying i ran into

815
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,919
this issue do you have a second

816
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,559
is going to take a lot less time

817
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,919
than going over there and stirring up a

818
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,279
bit and i know like management's going

819
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,039
oh my god don't do that we have a way

820
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,640
that we work through things you know it

821
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,720
has to go from the top down well guess

822
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
what we ended up in this mess for a

823
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,559
reason friendships and connections even

824
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,919
if they're just at work are going to go

825
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,840
a long way to being able to solve these

826
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,080
problems and in string security then in

827
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,240
my opinion following some top-down

828
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
top-down model on how we asked

829
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,799
permission to speak to people so uh i

830
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,240
know you laughed there but it's true i

831
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,520
know i'm gonna get the that's not who

832
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
you talk to about this issue

833
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
yeah what we're talking about is

834
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,240
building and leveraging social capital

835
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,720
for everyone to own security together

836
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,360
and like y'all are the experts and and i

837
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,320
appreciate that expertise i respect it

838
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,960
but i tell you what if you come to me

839
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,360
and or you come to my lead dev or my

840
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,520
product manager and say you have to do

841
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
this because x

842
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
i still respect your expertise i still

843
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,720
respect

844
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,320
uh your knowledge

845
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,919
but

846
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,679
you keep doing that it starts to chip

847
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,080
away at my respect of view

848
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,919
and that's not what you want to happen

849
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,600
you want the people that you work with

850
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,840
to respect you and to understand that

851
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,120
that you're on the same team

852
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,679
for our product managers security folks

853
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,120
how many of us even know who the product

854
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,480
managers are what products they're

855
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,840
handling what they're doing who their

856
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,679
customer base are and how many of you

857
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,360
are thinking why would i ever need to

858
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,640
know any of that

859
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,240
if you're going to sell them on the

860
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,159
security of their product knowing who

861
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,000
that product is going to go to and

862
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,440
perhaps maybe the security

863
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,960
vulnerabilities that they've already run

864
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,279
into breaches that have already happened

865
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,320
might really help you sell security as a

866
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,919
security as a service there security is

867
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,919
a function as

868
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,840
a good thing that the developers should

869
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,240
be spending their time on um all right

870
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,880
so that's what i have on that one johnny

871
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,799
yeah no that's it we've we've we've

872
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,840
covered

873
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,440
there's so much more we could talk about

874
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,360
with this as soon as we dove into this l

875
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
said this is an hour's worth of material

876
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,279
and we had to really trim it for y'all

877
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,279
so we left out some really cool stories

878
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,440
so if we give this talk again follow us

879
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,120
and and you may get the rest of the

880
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,760
story as paul harvey would say

881
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,279
the next point i want to give advice to

882
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,440
security managers i i love when people

883
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,080
say you know i'll go to bat for my team

884
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,519
you know that is my job as a manager to

885
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,039
be out there and spritz my neck for them

886
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,480
and the developers are saying that the

887
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,840
development management is saying the

888
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,760
same thing so great now we've created

889
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,039
two generals and i'm gonna keep going

890
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,320
with this war thing just because people

891
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,000
told me that it's not what it is so you

892
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,880
know

893
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,399
there is something to go to bat for your

894
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,840
team and there's something to go in

895
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
there with a bit of humility is that the

896
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,840
right word humility um and just willing

897
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,519
to say okay maybe we can take a step

898
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,200
back and learn something from the other

899
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
one maybe they do have a reason they

900
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,039
feel so strongly about this maybe it's

901
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,640
not because they're incompetent maybe

902
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,840
it's not because they don't understand

903
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,600
the amount of work that we do

904
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,200
um so management you are not only um you

905
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
can't you at some times when you're

906
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,279
trying to be an ally can definitely just

907
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,960
be another hurdle for somebody to get

908
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,880
through so whether you're management

909
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,799
whether you're just regular security

910
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,880
folk wherever you are sea lion i think

911
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,120
the big thing is that everyone has to

912
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,320
learn just to have that moment of

913
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,880
silence and when they ask you know why

914
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,840
does this need to happen or how can i

915
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,159
help um on security teams you know who

916
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,679
do you recommend john having worked with

917
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,200
myself and other security people who do

918
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,880
you recommend if they're devs out there

919
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,320
watching that they approach on the

920
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,039
security end

921
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,880
that's going to depend on your

922
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,440
organization but if there's someone

923
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,039
that's come to you with needs already

924
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,180
you could talk with them

925
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,399
[Music]

926
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,240
you could talk to your own manager and

927
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,799
say hey i want to do better with

928
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,880
security how do we do this how do i

929
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,840
engage you know if there's been you know

930
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,320
animosity and harsh words or whatever

931
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,399
before you might want someone else there

932
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,559
as a mediator for the first meeting or

933
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,360
two

934
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,679
but uh my advice on either side would be

935
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,440
the first very first thing you can do

936
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,760
would be if you work in the same area

937
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,960
together geographically or at the same

938
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,360
office just to say hey let's go to lunch

939
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,159
if not it would be to say uh you know

940
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,919
get to know that person a little bit as

941
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
a person rather than just a co-worker

942
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,080
and say you know find a common interest

943
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,320
that you can bond over rather than

944
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,440
fighting over work things first

945
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
that brings us to our parting words and

946
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,880
i know i you know in jest i hope

947
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,320
everybody knows that my aggression very

948
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,919
much has been ingested i love our

949
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,760
developer community i spend more time

950
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,799
with them honestly than probably our

951
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,919
security community at this point um and

952
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,159
my parting word is just to remember like

953
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,200
we are all humans we all make mistakes i

954
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,120
know very few people if any that i've

955
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,000
ever met that show up just not wanting

956
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,760
to do their job not wanting to be good

957
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
at it

958
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
and so the understanding that our common

959
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,720
enemy is time our condominium is the

960
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,880
scarcity of it the stress the

961
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
overburdens that we're going through

962
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,159
those are the things that we should be

963
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,520
fighting um against and so my takeaway

964
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
for you all is please just next time you

965
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,040
get frustrated with the code you don't

966
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,560
understand why now they're not doing

967
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,079
take a step moment take a moment of

968
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,159
silence and just turn the things around

969
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,918
and ask you know how could you help them

970
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,239
and why could this actually be an issue

971
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,879
that could benefit both of you john your

972
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,119
parting words

973
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,000
i love you guys

974
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
no seriously i love you guys because

975
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
y'all want y'all want things to be

976
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,440
secure

977
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,639
uh

978
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,399
and that's important

979
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,839
and uh and realize that

980
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,320
everyone wants what you want

981
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,879
um it's just a it's just the same we all

982
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,800
want the same thing for our organization

983
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,119
for a company no one wants to be

984
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,399
insecure

985
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,800
so if you start along those lines and

986
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,040
say assume positive intent then it

987
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,800
becomes much easier to connect and

988
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,560
figure out the path forward how to

989
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,680
incrementally ramp up on the security

990
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,839
stuff instead of saying

991
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,640
uh

992
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,960
what's there even on compliance i will

993
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,920
tell you on on new and upcoming products

994
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
and teams and companies i've been on

995
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,920
when we would fill out security surveys

996
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,000
for other other organizations

997
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,680
there were places where we would have to

998
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,359
put we're not there yet but we're

999
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,040
working on it and we have this plan and

1000
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,400
we're going to close the gap within

1001
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,160
three months or whatever and that's a

1002
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
that's a valid answer sometimes for some

1003
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,280
regulators um you can't do that forever

1004
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,920
but you can prioritize and you're better

1005
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
off getting something through that

1006
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,440
influence in that relationship and

1007
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,760
getting closer than continuing to beat

1008
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,240
to get the full list so

1009
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,800
i know y'all can do it uh i've seen

1010
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
people do it

1011
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,680
we were in the same place between dev

1012
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,800
and ops

1013
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
10 15 years ago

1014
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,079
and

1015
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,440
there's still some flare-ups here and

1016
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,720
there but compared then to now it's way

1017
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,800
better and the same thing's gonna happen

1018
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,000
in devsecops and you guys are the engine

1019
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,240
to make that happen so

1020
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,839
uh thanks for attending our talk thanks

1021
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,680
for letting us talk to you this has been

1022
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,760
great

1023
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,000
thanks happy to answer any questions or

1024
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,320
you know troll comments as i i'm sure i

1025
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,359
led up to a lot of them

1026
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,760
well that was great

1027
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,160
it was really great uh

1028
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,680
one one thing just

1029
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
blasted me in the face

1030
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,359
empathize find a common why and connect

1031
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,040
all right you guys have taken on one of

1032
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,359
the one of the harder things in infosec

1033
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,480
or in it in general and that is

1034
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,720
this group versus this group and not

1035
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,079
understanding

1036
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,680
each other not understanding their

1037
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,240
common goals and

1038
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,800
this this is a really great talk

1039
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,359
if you could next turn your attention to

1040
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,440
a couple political parties it would be

1041
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,680
really great to see some purple teaming

1042
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,078
there but that's a different discussion

1043
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,240
one world problem at a time

1044
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,079
there's a book right we did this

1045
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,520
there's a great book

1046
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,680
i would recommend that covers this topic

1047
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,520
in the middle i'm a big fan of adam

1048
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,560
grant

1049
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,720
and he just wrote the book think again

1050
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,640
and in the middle of that book he talks

1051
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,760
about how to reconcile between

1052
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,400
really crazy disparity it's it's it's

1053
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,160
amazing and it changed the way i

1054
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,320
approach people with opposite politics

1055
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,760
and i need probably need to go clean up

1056
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
my social media so people don't dig up

1057
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,280
and find what i said about the other

1058
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,280
side

1059
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
well said

1060
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,520
well thank you john for uh for

1061
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,680
coming in and being a part of this

1062
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
potentially hostile group

1063
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
and making it not hostile you know you

1064
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,359
guys working together to

1065
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,880
to bring compassion and empathy is

1066
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,800
really powerful i wasn't expecting half

1067
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,000
of what you said today it's really great

1068
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,340
brian have you seen any questions in

1069
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,520
[Music]

1070
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,640
chat

1071
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
so similar so uh actually i'm gonna back

1072

up for a moment here so uh

1073
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,240
we forgot to mention that uh there's

1074
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,480
also a discord chat going on here uh

1075
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,400
there's a chat here and then in go to

1076

meeting wait not everybody's supposed to

1077
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,680
know about it well

1078
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,960
my bad

1079
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,320
um but this is how we build

1080
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,839
relationships right we start chatting

1081
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,440
amongst each other and find that common

1082
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,320
ground and let's do that on discord um i

1083
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,920
saw there's something about a qr code

1084
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,000
man i don't know if you happen to have

1085
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,240
a qr code to share on screen or

1086
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,480
something like that but

1087
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,760
i don't but go to the uh the url

1088
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,880
about grimcon 07 and on that webpage

1089
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,400
there will be a

1090
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,960
a link to discord to join discord

1091
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,720
and once you join the grim public

1092
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,040
discord you should be able to see all of

1093
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,000
our channels and including specifically

1094
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,920
the track one chat which is where we're

1095
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,200
talking about

1096
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,720

yep but uh but yeah i didn't i didn't

1102
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,760

1103
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,960
i didn't see any questions but there was

1104
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
definitely some great conversation that

1105
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,079
came out of your talk here um i love

1106
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,079
i love the uh the both sides being

1107
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,000
presented well you know you're yeah

1108
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,520
you're just showing up you're

1109
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,079
non-combative you're just showing

1110
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,000
which which point of view you're coming

1111
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
from and how they overlap and how they

1112
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,160
kind of collide when we don't quite

1113
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,920
understand what the others thinking it's

1114
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
really well done

1115
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,200
and both of those

1116
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,920
are

1117
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,720
right

1118
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,839
so

1119
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,680
can you give the name of the book again

1120
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
i'm just gonna keep talking my bad yeah

1121
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,480
thank you think again by adam grant yeah

1122
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,400
so that's the name of the book i

1123
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
mentioned uh since someone said a

1124
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,839
reading list for all the from all the

1125
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,640
talks i think that's a great idea uh

1126
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,040
i'll be back on the track one chat uh to

1127
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,119
drop a few books that i'd recommend if

1128
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,640
you're interested in learning about this

1129
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,520
stuff

1130
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,599
uh the phoenix project is another one

1131
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,480
i'd put out there and uh if you want to

1132
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,240
learn about you know process and

1133
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
overburden and how you work together

1134
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,720
there's some other books too so

1135
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,440
yeah yeah brian just posted the one in

1136
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,040
there brian you want to write that other

1137
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,560
one down the extension

1138
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,079
from chat

1139
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,160
okay yep go ahead with questions sorry

1140
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,000
uh for devs is there a real applicable

1141
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,760
security course in your experience

1142
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
probably targeted well actually both of

1143
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,480
you

1144
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
um in your experience it's worth the

1145
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,280
time to take for them

1146
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,480
yeah that's

1147
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,240
that's i want someone in the chat to

1148
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,920
answer that question because i want to

1149
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,240
know that so that we can do that

1150
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,720
i 100 have one for you

1151
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,319
and it's not a course specifically you

1152
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,599
don't have to take the cert but just

1153
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,079
study for your plus because in security

1154
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,480
we talk in alphabet soup and we refuse

1155
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,319
to do otherwise and then we look at you

1156
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,760
like you're crazy if you don't know if

1157
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,920
you know saas you're you're sas but is

1158
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,119
that securing the service or is that

1159
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,480
your software as a service or is that

1160
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,000
like a function as a service and you

1161
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,440
know geometry

1162
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,560
um

1163
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
and i i i know it sounds tongue-in-cheek

1164
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,720
but really i think that has been going

1165
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,800
through dev and security worlds the

1166
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,560
easiest thing for me to do is to learn

1167
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,920
their language

1168
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,520
is to learn how it is they speak and why

1169
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,280
they speak in that way and to me

1170
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
starting out the sec plus was the one

1171
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,560
that just opened the doors for me you

1172
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,680
don't have to know how it works just

1173
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,079
know what it is

1174
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,520
so that would be my recommendation is

1175
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,000
just learn the language

1176
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,480
and uh there's there's a concept on

1177
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,960
agile teams or lean lean development

1178
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
teams that they talk about called a

1179
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,200
t-shaped

1180
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,319
uh

1181
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,079
skill profile and what that means is

1182
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,160
that i'm good at a lot of things but i'm

1183
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,839
really good at one thing and i'm deeper

1184
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,640
there

1185
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,599
and that idea is that uh if you talk

1186
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,359
about finding or building allies or

1187
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,440
whatever it that could be an initiative

1188
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,359
in your organization is to say hey we

1189
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,760
would like one person on every team to

1190
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,839
have one of these certs so they have

1191
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,359
that knowledge and can be a better

1192
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,040
interface with security about those

1193
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,079
things

1194
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,599
and that's that's a concept that's

1195
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,839
familiar to agile teams because they'll

1196
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,680
say yeah we have this guy's kind of the

1197
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,520
database guy this guy's the source

1198
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,680
control guy if you have questions you

1199
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,000
have that experience that expertise

1200
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,760
spread around the team so that's really

1201
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,119
cool

1202
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,760
that's fantastic advice i i run a grc

1203
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,440
team where i work and and we do a

1204
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,960
similar thing there are some

1205
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,040
commonalities like see you know the sysp

1206
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,560
or cissp

1207
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,800
um but in the areas of compliance we do

1208
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,040
have people focused a couple people uh

1209
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,880
excuse me couple people focus on one

1210
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,160
area or another right so pci isas

1211
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
people have gone through high trust or

1212
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,200
what is it hcis pp

1213
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,599
um in the healthcare space

1214
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,960
things like that so yeah i think that's

1215
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,040
fantastic advice specializing amongst a

1216
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,960
couple people so you can rely upon that

1217
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,280
knowledge

1218
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,440
nice

1219
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,280
uh we had somebody

1220
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,400
pimping tonya's courses in chat as well

1221
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,040
and i'd like to i want to say that here

1222
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,560
there are there are other

1223
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,160
great things being said in chat but i

1224
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,680
wanted to actually call that one out

1225
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,330
