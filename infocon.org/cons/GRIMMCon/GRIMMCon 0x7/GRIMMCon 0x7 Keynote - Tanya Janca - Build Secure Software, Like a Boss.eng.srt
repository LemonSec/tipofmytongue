people here I follow info infosec

9
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,659
Twitter and for a couple of years Tanya

10
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,920
kept showing up

11
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,960
as uh some of that people that I follow

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,700
you know they've liked her posts or

13
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,680
commented on I was never following Tanya

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,759
until about

15
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,439
uh I think it was actually February of

16
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,479
this year if I remember correctly

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
um and she had a post about yelling

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,619
yeah and uh and she talked about being

19
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,780
in a hardcore band

20
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,500
um

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,899
and uh and so that you know she could

22
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,579
scream if necessary the point of the

23
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,200
post was not to be screaming at people

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,520
right

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,439
um but I interacted and I said hey are

26
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,240
we talking about hardcore punk and she

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,399
said yes and I was like oh man I'm into

28
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,640
punk rock too so uh Tanya I got a quick

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,780
question for you

30
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,479
um lagwagon are you into lagwagon or are

31
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,800
you still on the left okay did you

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
celebrate lag wagon Day on on May 16th I

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,780
did not know they have their own day I

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,120
was not a huge Lego fan but I had them

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,280
on like a ton of My Pokemon and various

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,300
other mixtapes that I had CDs that I had

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,680
gotcha that's cool they have a song

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,239
called May 16th and so it's like an

39
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,379
unofficial

40
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,560
uh lag wagon Day on May 16th so I just I

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,720
had no idea you could just declare your

42
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,920
own day

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,260
yeah yeah yes and just listened to punk

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,879
rock all day long I mean specifically

45
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,280
lagwagon or maybe maybe uh bands on fat

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,519
records or something but

47
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,800

the fattest Etc all the different like

49
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,599
playlists they'd put together yeah back

way back in the day way back in the day

51
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,300
that's awesome

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,599
well Tanya I I've got a ton of stuff

53
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,640
that I could say about you but

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
uh you've done some really amazing

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,200
things over the years all centering

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
around this color purple I won't make

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
you dive too much into that but it is

58
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,540
the best color of all I'm really curious

59
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,879
uh

60
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,620
well I wanna I Wanna Give You a chance

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,540
to introduce yourself instead of me talk

62
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,640
about you but wow uh best-selling author

63
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,060
uh coding and working in I.T you've got

64
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,159
you've had quite an illustrious career

65
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,540
I'm so thankful you could join us today

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,360
and give us this Keynote

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,560
how did you get into cyber security

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,239
um I was a software developer for a

69
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,680
really long time

70
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,879
and

71
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,180
there was an ethical hacker in my office

72
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,799
and so here he would do pen tests

73
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,019
occasionally and he was an abandoned

74
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,780
eyes in a band so and we've sort of

75
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,640
chatted sometimes and one day I walked

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,140
up to him and I said

77
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,060
so my band wrote this song called

78
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,340
mandatory dance party and we want to

79
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,739
make a mobile app where if two people

80
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,239
both have it installed and they get

81
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,879
close to it other it'll be like

82
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,200
mandatory dance party and it'll Play Our

83
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,760
Song and then they have to have a dance

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,799
party and then based on how much the

85
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,180
phone moves so we can figure out who

86
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,160
wins and then at the end of the song

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,199
it's like this one's the winner

88
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
continue on in your day and then that's

89
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,400
it he's like yeah I want to help that

90
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,780
sounds awesome

91
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,639
and then we became friends and then

92
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,160
eventually after a few years he's just

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,960
he kept asking me and asking me and

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,180
asking me to join infosec and be his

95
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,160
apprentice and I was like

96
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,340
oh give it a try we'll see how it goes I

97
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,660
don't know software development's pretty

98
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,880
awesome but it turned out I did like it

99
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,280
and then I discovered appsec rather than

100
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,440
just pen testing was the thing that was

101
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,960
best for me because you kind of get to

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,340
hang out with software developers all

103
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,720
day

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,520
um and it's more kind of like social

105
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,620
than pen testing I found pen testing a

106
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,500
bit lonely like not that it's just like

107
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,900
a really extroverted it's just it's not

108
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,000
the right job for me even though I did

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,520
it for a while and I still liked blowing

110
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
things up

111
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,680
it is best done in groups at least pairs

112
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,580
but yes

113
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,820
well awesome uh let's let you get off

114
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,199
and take it away you've got lots of

115
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,060
great stuff to share and we'll chat a

116
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,340
little bit afterwards awesome so I have

117
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,840
30 minutes

118
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,220
30 minutes perfect okay thank you hi

119
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,960
everyone so I'm Tanya and I'm a giant

120
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,139
nerd as previously discussed and I want

121
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,759
to talk about how to build secure

122
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,120
software like a boss and so the like a

123
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,340
boss is sort of like old slang

124
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,220
um because I'm silly but my obsession is

125
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,300
how to make software more secure and so

126
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,100
okay let me tell you what this Talk's

127
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,280
going to be about so I I like telling

128
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,020
people what I'm gonna tell them

129
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,180
and then I I tell them that's the talk

130
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,560
and then at the end there's a conclusion

131
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,900
because I tell you what I I told you and

132
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,340
the reason for that is is that I want

133
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,139
you to remember certain things so we're

134
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,880
going to talk about how insecure apps

135
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,280
are a big problem they really are

136
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,979
it's costing millions and millions if

137
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,680
not um billions of dollars each year of

138
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,440
problems data leaks hurt people all

139
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,500
right data breaches and um there's just

140
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,940
so much more

141
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,500
we're going to talk about why you

142
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,180
specifically you the audience person

143
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,520
right now need to secure your

144
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,340
applications I'm going to talk about a

145
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,080
secure system development life cycle so

146
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,060
I'm going to talk about that oh a fair

147
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,900
bit so the sdlc is how people software

148
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,000
developers every day make software and

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,860
there's a couple different models

150
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,860
we can still add security to any model

151
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,080
that there is and now I'm going to talk

152
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,880
about what you specifically the audience

153
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,580
member right now can do immediately

154
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,560
there's a bunch of things that you can

155
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,599
do and there's choices so that you can

156
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:55,860
figure out which one's best for you

157
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,300
which one seems like the most fun or

158
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,680
which one you're allowed to do because

159
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,960
some offices will be like oh way

160
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,060
and then a bunch of resources I always

161
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,400
end all my talk with resources

162
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
um and

163
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,360
basically I I made all of the courses

164
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,099
that I created for my company free

165
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,860
recently and so there's a whole bunch of

166
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,080
stuff but that's the biggest one so who

167
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
am I so I am a giant nerd I'm the

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,280
director of developer relations and

169
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,199
Community upright

170
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,360
um I founded we hack purple I wrote a

171
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,900
book I'm an advisor I do I'm a nerd at

172
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,919
Large

173
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,819
on the internet and I do that about me

174
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,099
so I try to show off to be like please

175
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,680
stay for the whole talk I'm competent I

176
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,180
promise despite the fact that I'm

177
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,020
incredibly silly okay so let's do this

178
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,639
so I want to tell you a bit about the

179
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,440
current state of affairs because I find

180
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,419
a lot of people are on a different page

181
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,180
in regard to each different thing and I

182
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,319
want to make sure we're all talking the

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,180
same language and so

184
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,400
this is going to be a review for a bunch

185
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,500
of you but some of you you might be like

186
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,020
oh I didn't know it was that bad or oh I

187
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,080
didn't know we could do it like this so

188
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,900
um so you've been hacked as a thing I

189
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,720
hear quite a bit and it the grammar bugs

190
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,639
me but

191
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,419
um

192
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,699
the number one cause of data breach

193
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,560
according to the Verizon breach report

194
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,620
every year for many many years is

195
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,759
insecure web applications and web apis

196
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,220
it's it's not phishing it's not point of

197
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,379
sale just data breaches which is the

198
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,940
worst type of security incident is

199
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,099
caused number one cause every single

200
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,860
year is insecure web applications

201
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,059
and

202
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,039
if you look at the numbers that they

203
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,260
present a quarter of all security

204
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,599
incidents are caused by software

205
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,420
vulnerabilities but if you look at your

206
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,700
company and you looked at the budget for

207
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,800
security

208
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,620
um 25 of it would not be going to

209
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,440
software that's very rare usually it's

210
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,240
mostly like firewall like firewalls like

211
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,100
Enterprise security network security

212
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,440
Cloud security Etc and then for some

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,019
reason application security or software

214
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,820
security is just like the lowest on the

215
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,620
list and they're like the devs will

216
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,720
handle it it's like well clearly they're

217
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,580
not so we need to help them we need to

218
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,160
pitch in with them to get this done and

219
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,100
so I feel that something so this has

220
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,380
improved a lot since I started giving

221
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,779
talks when I first started almost no

222
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,899
companies had any part of their team or

223
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,700
any employee looking at the software of

224
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,200
security but now it's starting to expand

225
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,519
it's starting to improve which is

226
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,480
awesome

227
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,420
but most software or most security teams

228
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,000
concentrate mostly on the perimeter like

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,519
mean and by that I mean firewalls

230
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,920
networks and infrastructure

231
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,540
they work really hard on patch

232
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,459
management and lots of vendor Supply

233
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,980
solutions kind of take up all of their

234
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,940
day and a lot of security teams have no

235
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,980
experience building software or very

236
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,380
little and they certainly don't know how

237
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,839
to do a secure system development life

238
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,519
cycle and so then you have software

239
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,260
developers like I went to school in the

240
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,320
90s I graduated in 2000 that was 22

241
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,180
years ago I assure you there was nothing

242
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,360
about security then and so we're

243
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,820
counting on people who still today most

244
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,079
of them don't get anything about

245
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,060
security they get graduated I were just

246
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,040
like I hope they do a good job it's not

247
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,899
like our whole business depends on it

248
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,720
and it's a little bit like locking your

249
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,100
front door and having a whole bunch of

250
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,480
blocks on your front door but then you

251
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,579
leave a window open on your first floor

252
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:30,120
at the back of the building it's like

253
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,160
um so what the heck am I talking about

254
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,440
when I say application security

255
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,500
so it's any and every activity that you

256
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,959
perform to ensure your software is

257
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,540
secure uh who said that I said that so I

258
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,920
used to just have that on the screen and

259
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,060
people were like you should make it a

260
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,980
quote I'm like but who said it they're

261
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,320
like you did and I thought it was silly

262
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,380
but the point is is if you are doing a

263
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,839
secure code review if you are hiring

264
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,220
someone to come in and do a pen test

265
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,220
that's appsec but apps that can also be

266
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,920
a software developer listening to a

267
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,200
podcast hearing about oh well I heard

268
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
there's this new vulnerability that's

269
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,060
being exploited in the wild and it has

270
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,279
to do with our framework and I need to

271
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,839
see if we have that version because I'm

272
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,279
really worried and coming in and

273
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,680
checking at work and if it is a problem

274
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,980
saying something and doing something and

275
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,019
it's like any of those things can be

276
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,420
part of absec it's you helping to fight

277
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,220
the good fight to make all the software

278
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,380
more secure

279
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,899
so another thing that I still see

280
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,880
unfortunately so almost all the jobs in

281
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,279
afsec are penetration testing

282
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,620
and it's because a lot of companies are

283
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,060
like well we'll just hire someone at the

284
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,980
end to check everything

285
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,620
and so when I was a pen tester so I was

286
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,360
I would love to tell you how I was like

287
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,300
super the best fantastic so amazing

288
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,600
that's not true I only did it for a year

289
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,399
and a half before I switched to appsec

290
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,399
and I would find tons of things wrong

291
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,260
and it wasn't because I was the best

292
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,320
ever it's because no one had ever looked

293
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,959
before me and no one had given any help

294
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,060
to the software developers no advice no

295
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,000
guidance no they gave them no tools like

296
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,540
no no testing tools no analysis tools no

297
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,880
training nothing and then I would come

298
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,620
in at the very end and I'd be like

299
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,360
shooting fish in a barrel and I'd love

300
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,220
to tell you again that I'm like the best

301
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,820
badass fantastic but I was not I just

302
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,540
barely started and it just like this is

303
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,180
the most expensive way to do application

304
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,399
security and it's not very productive

305
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,560
either so like do I think pen tests are

306
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,839
important yes do I think it should come

307
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,560
at the end yes do I think it's the the

308
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,480
first the think we should do no it's at

309
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
the end we need to start way earlier we

310
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,380
need to help them the whole way through

311
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,360
and so

312
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,820
um I yes I see this a lot I see a lot of

313
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,560
companies just burning tons of money

314
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,700
this way

315
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,079
okay so this is the Mandate of every it

316
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,740
security team is to protect the to

317
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,860
protect the con the confidentiality the

318
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,980
integrity and the availability the CIA

319
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,180
of the applications or systems and all

320
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,459
the data that your company creates and

321
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,579
maintains that's our job like every

322
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,680
single thing they like every single

323
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,420
piece of software whether you make the

324
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,740
software you install the software

325
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,440
whether like any of those things that's

326
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,019
what our job is to protect the CIA

327
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,700
and when I show this to software

328
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,959
developers I'm like who's seen this

329
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,160
before who's heard of this before

330
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,019
they'll be like one dude at the back

331
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,820
it's like I kind of heard about it once

332
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,180
in a meeting

333
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,860
I.T security folks we are not awesome at

334
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,560
marketing we are amazing at keeping

335
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,639
secrets and we're not amazing at

336
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,560
like spreading the good word of security

337
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,620
okay so the last thing that I'm gonna

338
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,779
say that is part of this like kind of

339
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,420
build up is what is Shifting laughter

340
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,000
pushing left so I will say pushing left

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,519
because many places I worked I wasn't

342
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,279
invited to start security earlier so I

343
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,779
had to push for it and I had to ask for

344
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,079
it and I had to be really really pushy

345
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,139
about it and so shifting left means

346
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,139
starting security earlier in the system

347
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,880
development life cycle so right at the

348
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,639
beginning so if you imagine the system

349
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,500
development life cycle written out on a

350
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,579
piece of paper

351
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,740
the further left you go see how it's

352
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,300
going towards the left that means you're

353
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,579
earlier because that's the way English

354
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,800
people write we write from left to right

355
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,440
and so

356
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,500
if we start with security advice in the

357
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,880
requirements phase we give them security

358
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,399
requirements if we analyze their design

359
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,500
with them we do threat modeling we do we

360
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,480
apply secure Design Concepts during the

361
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,339
design phase during the code phase

362
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,720
there's so many things we can do and I'm

363
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,579
going to get into a whole bunch of them

364
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:55,019
but if we just do pen testing right

365
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,639
before the release right before the pink

366
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,740
part like why are we starting so late

367
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,300
what were we doing that whole time when

368
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,279
we could have been helping them and so

369
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,560
pushing last means security wants to be

370
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,899
invited to the party earlier

371
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,120
as soon as possible we won't be at the

372
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,980
party at the very beginning

373
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,380
and we want to stay until the end

374
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,720
so you probably so at this point I hope

375
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,100
that you're thinking like how do we

376
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,079
build secure software like a boss how do

377
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,459
we do that

378
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,459
and my answer is is that you follow a

379
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,860
secure system development life cycle

380
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,720
sometimes people call this an appsec

381
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,000
program so an appsec program can be a

382
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,320
whole bunch of things

383
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,660
but outside program always involves a

384
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,060
secure system development life cycle and

385
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,560
what it is is US adding security steps

386
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,420
throughout the sdlc so it's the

387
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,579
formalization like making it official

388
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,680
that security activities are going to

389
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,560
happen every single time in each part of

390
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,259
the sdlc and so sometimes this is known

391
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:53,699
as an abstract program so I'm going to

392
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,920
go through the five phases of the sdlc

393
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,019
and talk about things we can add and how

394
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,639
we can make it better

395
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,399
and here's the thing is that if you are

396
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,500
doing waterfall if you're doing agile if

397
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,480
you're doing devops you still need

398
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,519
requirements you still need to know what

399
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,160
you're building and you still need to

400
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,500
design it and you still need to code it

401
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,940
you're just doing it in smaller

402
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,680
increments and so this means we just

403
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,699
change the size or way that we do each

404
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,440
one of these steps but you still have to

405
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,199
do all of them and so let's look at

406
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,360
security requirements to start so this

407
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,459
person is quite excited so this is all

408
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,959
the way to the left this is the very

409
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,940
very very first one

410
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,240
and basically I believe when you start a

411
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,860
requirements document

412
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,860
for a project that you should always add

413
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,180
in security requirements so let's say

414
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,399
you're making a web app uh so the next

415
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,779
page I'm gonna have a list of web app

416
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,000
requirements if you're making an API I'm

417
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,079
going to have slightly different

418
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,060
requirements let's say you're making

419
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,040
something that doesn't go on the web I

420
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,420
want to have security requirements for

421
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,899
that too and so

422
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,459
when you're giving this list of things

423
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,079
that the devs know they have to build in

424
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,439
if you build Security in from the start

425
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,959
two thumbs up would recommend to friends

426
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,020
trust me it really helps so this is a

427
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,459
list of requirements I'm not going to

428
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,439
read them out to you it's very long but

429
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,959
this is a generic list that we give away

430
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,720
with we hack purple all the time but the

431
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,699
ideas is that you could start with a

432
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,799
very generic list and then you keep

433
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,599
adding and adding and adding and adding

434
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,160
things

435
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,280
until it's perfect for your organization

436
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,760
and so the next step in the sdlc is

437
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,280
secure design and so if we're going to

438
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,900
do a design phase let's make sure it's

439
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,400
secure and so there's a bunch of

440
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
different things that you can do this

441
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,700
guy looks really happy is why I chose

442
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,900
this

443
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,080
um so first of all we could design like

444
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,360
we could do a whiteboarding session so I

445
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,160
ask you like okay so you have like a

446
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,660
front end that's cool so then you have a

447
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,179
bunch of microservices at the back that

448
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,220
are web API is cool like where are those

449
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,500
oh do those go through an API Gateway no

450
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,240
they don't okay they're just exposed to

451
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
the internet that's cool how can we make

452
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,900
sure they're safe blah blah blah you

453
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,520
just like actually just draw out on a

454
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,919
whiteboard and you just talk about it

455
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,360
and then I'm like I want you to add this

456
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,280
here I want you to add that there and it

457
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,799
would be really cool if this did this

458
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,140
and then they're just designing it so

459
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,640
then like they could do it right then

460
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,280
it's really hard to redesign stuff later

461
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,520
it's very expensive but doing it at the

462
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,799
start is easy you could follow secure

463
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,720
Design Concepts that's the thing that I

464
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,160
teach all the time and I have a talk

465
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,740
about and it's just these are really

466
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,440
common design security things that you

467
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,059
could just add like least privilege or

468
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,919
ensuring the security you've added is

469
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,900
actually usable

470
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,880
and one of the most fun ones threat

471
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,620
modeling which is brainstorming but evil

472
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,000
and so you meet you have a security

473
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,059
person you have a business

474
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,720
representative so that could be the

475
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,140
product owner and then you have a sec a

476
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,419
like a technical member of the dev team

477
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,100
and so that could be a software

478
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,080
architect it could be the lead Dev it

479
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,400
doesn't matter there's someone that

480
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,960
knows the app inside and out and you

481
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,360
brainstorm what could go wrong and then

482
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,620
you figure out how you can make sure it

483
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,660
does not happen

484
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,299
and secure design

485
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,460
so I said secure coding standards I feel

486
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,900
like the secure coding standards should

487
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,660
go in this the coding section got to

488
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,679
correct that

489
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,240
but giving them

490
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,160
the standard and guideline and teaching

491
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,360
it to them

492
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,400
so that they just write more secure code

493
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,559
from the start because they know how to

494
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,640
do it

495
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,740
and then security reference materials so

496
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,760
let's say you're like we're going to

497
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,200
build a serverless app I'm like that's

498
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,340
awesome

499
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,740
here's some information and guidance

500
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,419
that I'd like to give you about how to

501
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,340
do that more safely

502
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,100
and especially training training's super

503
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,480
important

504
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,880
um I realized that like I run a training

505
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,320
company but we got acquired so I don't

506
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
have to sell training anymore all my

507
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,559
training's free I still think it's the

508
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,360
absolute most important thing you can do

509
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,520
and so even though all the training's

510
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,220
free now I still believe that if we are

511
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,500
not gonna that we aren't gonna get what

512
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,720
we want as often if we are training

513
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,820
everyone on how to do their job securely

514
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,200
and this doesn't mean just software

515
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,659
developers I mean like help desk citizen

516
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:12,360
operations folks all those people when

517
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,919
we train them to do their job securely

518
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,440
we get more of what we want which means

519
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,380
less security incidents and breaches

520
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,380
so secure coding I love trees this

521
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,640
picture is beautiful

522
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,740
so in the coding phase we want to do

523
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,480
secure coding so we follow the secure

524
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,820
cutting best practices ideally you've

525
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,700
given them a standard or a guideline to

526
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,200
tell them what you actually expect don't

527
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,600
just be like practice care coding that's

528
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,340
that's like saying don't make any

529
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,700
mistakes that's not clear instead teach

530
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,620
them what you want give them guidance

531
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,440
give them documentation I am a big fan

532
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,480
of if you're going to make unit tests

533
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,940
also make security unit tests so you

534
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,100
test that it can handle bad input you

535
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,000
test that it is graceful when it fails

536
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,260
there's all sorts of ways you can do

537
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,700
this yourself there's automation for

538
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,620
this but basically then every time you

539
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,419
check in your code it runs all those

540
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,580
little unit tests and it makes sure that

541
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,039
the unit tests your Dev road is like and

542
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,080
make sure it works properly and then the

543
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,580
security test makes sure it does not

544
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,260
work improperly

545
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,539
code review so let's say you're going to

546
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,340
check code you're going to do a code

547
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,380
review on every pull request of new code

548
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,659
teach that person how to review for

549
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:25,080
security so they look for secure code

550
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,059
um security secure coding training or

551
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,520
education a secure coding Library which

552
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,320
means templates have already been tested

553
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,140
for security and everyone reuses those

554
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,900
known good samples there's really really

555
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,320
cool IDE plugins so an ID is the thing

556
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,179
the programmer programs in all day and

557
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,919
basically you can do like a spell

558
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,380
checker for code and all sorts of other

559
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,260
cool things to help you

560
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,400
verify if there are security problem is

561
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,860
so sass the static application security

562
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,080
testing so you can have a plug-in for

563
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,580
that that will basically tell you like I

564
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,260
think we've you've made this coding

565
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,440
mistake please do this instead software

566
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,240
composition analysis which will tell you

567
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,400
hey I think that library that you

568
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,580
installed is ancient and it has lots of

569
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,559
vulnerabilities and I suggest you update

570
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,260
to this version this version safe

571
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,900
and third linting linting is like the

572
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,520
grammar place for your code it's about

573
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,340
quality and about security and linting

574
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,380
especially with apis is very important

575
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,299
to make sure that it's formatted

576
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,220
correctly so all the automated tools can

577
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,740
read it so some people are less excited

578
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,419
about linters but I think linters are

579
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,059
great I just also think my spell checker

580
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,500
is great because it makes it look like I

581
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,940
have perfect spelling when in fact

582
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,740
sometimes I make errors

583
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,840
and so then in the testing phase you

584
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,500
want to do security testing and the

585
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,700
first one and the one that everyone

586
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,860
probably knows about the most because in

587
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,919
movies you see hackers uh the thing that

588
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,679
they use the most often is a desk the

589
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,600
dynamic application security testing

590
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,520
tool sometimes called a web app scanner

591
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,340
sometimes called a web proxy sometimes

592
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,380
called pew pew pew pew

593
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,260
but basically it interacts with your web

594
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,960
application and then tells you about all

595
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,460
the vulnerabilities that things are in

596
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,380
there and it finds lots of things wrong

597
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,820
very quickly

598
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,799
static application security testing you

599
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,480
can do this again so you can have a

600
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,039
security professional do this in the

601
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,980
testing phase or you can have it done by

602
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,720
the developers in the dev phase or the

603
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,940
coding phase you could do it both with

604
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,559
different tools there's a lot of options

605
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,720
but it analyzes the code that your team

606
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,980
wrote

607
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,559
software composition analysis or SCA

608
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,620
this looks at your

609
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,179
basically all the code your team didn't

610
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,039
write so libraries you get packages

611
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,640
third party components ruby gems all the

612
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,919
stuff that your team did not write it

613
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,440
Compares it against a list of known bad

614
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,900
stuff that they worked very hard on and

615
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,600
it just tells you like that good package

616
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,840
bad news like don't use it at all or

617
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,940
usually it's like upgrade to this

618
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,279
version where they fix those bugs

619
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,340
security unit tests again every time

620
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,080
you're checking in code for a bug that

621
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,400
you fix you should be running all your

622
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,080
unit tests again including your security

623
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,059
unit tests so that you make sure you

624
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,820
don't introduce new bugs when you fix a

625
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,480
little bug code review again linking

626
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,179
again and then the most famous one from

627
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,580
everywhere penetration testing

628
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,679
like people a lot of people tell me

629
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,480
they're like I saw the movie hackers and

630
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,220
then I wanted to get into security and

631
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,539
I'm like awesome

632
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,700
this should be your most exciting page

633
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,279
of my entire presentation

634
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,559
um so deploy release and maintain phase

635
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,539
so this is a phase this is the final

636
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:40,919
phase of the sdlc and in that phase

637
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,080
you want to do security testing in your

638
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,820
CI CD so if you're releasing your

639
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,559
software using an automated system

640
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,960
sometimes called the devops pipeline or

641
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,539
a CI CD pipeline you can add security

642
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,340
testing of all the testing we talked

643
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,380
about you want to probably condense it

644
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,900
and tune it and make sure it's going as

645
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,760
fast as possible you don't want to be

646
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,799
running 18 hours no one will want to

647
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,360
hang out with you later because that is

648
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,159
annoying you want to make sure you're

649
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,020
going fast and you're being accurate in

650
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,480
a CI CD pipeline but it can be done

651
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,679
you want to make sure you're doing

652
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,260
logging monitoring and alerting when it

653
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,760
is out in prod just because you've

654
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,840
released it does not mean your

655
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,520
responsibility is over

656
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,400
and I continue to do security testing

657
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,740
because like

658
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,080
suffered as an a12 doesn't age like wine

659
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,820
it ages like cheese in the Sun

660
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,679
uh more advanced stuff so you could

661
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,539
create a coordinated disclosure program

662
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,400
so that if someone finds something wrong

663
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,779
with your software they know how to

664
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,480
report it to you could do a bug Bounty

665
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,880
program inviting like security

666
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,340
researchers from all over the planet to

667
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,140
look at a copy of your application and

668
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,880
find even more bugs for you and then you

669
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,860
pay them whenever they find something

670
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,500
red teaming so this means having a team

671
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,480
of pen testers attack your production

672
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,760
systems and then tell you what they

673
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,380
found so you can make your production

674
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,380
systems even more secure

675
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,260
and that is a secure sdlc but I'm hoping

676
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,820
that you're thinking right now like what

677
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,360
can I do how can I make my software more

678
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,380
secure

679
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,720
and the first one is you could test your

680
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,720
code and so this is how I started

681
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,880
and honestly when I run a desk I still

682
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,799
feel a little peop

683
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:23,279
so anyone is not her can use a dynamic

684
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,100
application security testing tool or

685
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,260
dast for short so security folks call it

686
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,179
Das software developers will say you

687
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,039
know that web app scanner thing that's

688
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,260
what I used to call it you use your

689
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,960
scanner tell me what's wrong

690
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,539
um it automates tests for you it'll tell

691
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,159
you what it found and how you should fix

692
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,840
those things there's paid ones there's

693
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,020
free one free ones but a very important

694
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,900
part is do not use a dynamic scanner on

695
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,940
an app unless you have permission in

696
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,220
writing to test it so do not point this

697
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,440
at walmart.com that will not end well

698
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,600
for you only test things that you have

699
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,659
permission to test and make sure that

700
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,000
you have like done some training on that

701
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,740
product so that you don't blow stuff up

702
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,779
at work or do it on your own home

703
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,580
computer and build a little lab like run

704
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,020
a little container or virtual machine

705
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,120
with a known vulnerable app and they'll

706
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,779
be like

707
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,179
you and learn about it that way before

708
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,620
you do it at work

709
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,620
and not old asks are safe I have made a

710
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,539
mess with some of them before some of

711
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,820
them are safer than others but have a

712
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,980
backup of your data just in case that is

713
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,779
important

714
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,520
the next one that you could start right

715
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,679
away is threat modeling so I was not as

716
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,659
good at this when I started as I am now

717
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,700
because I was a software developer

718
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,620
as a software developer it was my job to

719
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,960
make everything work and make everything

720
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,919
make my clients happy and it took me a

721
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,899
while my mentor used to say take off

722
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:49,559
your developer hat and put on

723
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,539
your hacker hat

724
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,799
and

725
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,380
I would I would look at it and think how

726
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,419
can I make it do what it should not do

727
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,020
and so threat modeling a system is a

728
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,640
brainstorming session and every time you

729
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,380
do it you will Flex that muscle until

730
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,720
stronger stronger and stronger so you

731
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,059
figure out negative use cases sometimes

732
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,399
called abuse cases and then how to

733
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,799
defend against them it's literally a

734
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,600
brainstorming session it can be super

735
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,760
super fun and you're trying to figure

736
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,380
out what could go wrong

737
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,240
then you search your code when you do

738
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,679
code review you look for this when you

739
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,960
do testing you look for these threads

740
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,020
you can think like an adversary and find

741
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,360
vulnerability seriously it's really fun

742
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,159
I know that sounds silly but like I

743
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,539
remember going to the movies and being

744
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,399
like I could have gotten free because

745
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,260
they never checked this or you could

746
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,360
just stay late after the movie and you

747
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,039
could just go see another and like all

748
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,299
of a sudden I saw all these

749
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:43,860
possibilities and flaws and security

750
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,020
like everywhere I go now I can't stop

751
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,460
seeing it I'm like I have to tell you

752
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,419
there's something wrong with your

753
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:50,399
security

754
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,559
and so once you start thinking like this

755
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,000
you'll just start seeing flaws

756
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,820
everywhere and fixing now

757
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,260
um you could review your code so if it's

758
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,700
your job to write code you can review

759
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,960
code look she has a whole bunch of

760
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,880
people helping her review her code yeah

761
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,260
that wouldn't be intimidating having

762
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,679
four people standing over your shoulder

763
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,080
um so most people use a static

764
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,480
application security testing tool and

765
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,120
manual analysis so you start looking for

766
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,860
things because you can if you've taken

767
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,480
secure coding training you start knowing

768
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,120
what to look for and then a SAS tool can

769
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,740
look in a way that computers look like

770
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,600
they can look at recursion and symbolic

771
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,720
analysis Etc and see even more problems

772
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,520
you want to make sure you check out your

773
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,940
libraries so we do static software

774
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,700
competition analysis SCA to make sure

775
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,980
that all the plugins and third-party

776
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,020
components are safe to use

777
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,419
manual code review so someone's checking

778
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:43,919
in some code you're like cool I'm just

779
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,539
going to take a quick look

780
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,460
search for your threat models like we

781
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,799
said in the last one you can find more

782
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,020
than just security bugs um I ran one of

783
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,360
these tools well I hired a release Mark

784
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,159
consultant for one of these tools it was

785
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,100
the first exposure I had this ask and we

786
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,080
had this app where we had to run it

787
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,659
on a 32 kilobit in the Arctic because

788
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,640
I'm Canadian and people in the Arctic

789
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,679
still need to vote and we're creating a

790
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,360
system that helped figure out

791
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,779
you know that you can vote and um and we

792
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,360
found 22 memory leaks in our app and we

793
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,220
fixed all of them thanks to the SAS tool

794
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,840
so it helps with quality of your

795
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,760
application and security security is a

796
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,799
part of quality right

797
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,960
and so you can find way more than just

798
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,880
security bugs by doing this

799
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,399
and so this last one writing better code

800
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,980
and I want to note that I am not being

801
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,659
condescending when I say this well you

802
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,919
could just write better code

803
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,620
that's rude what I mean is that when you

804
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,539
see a professional athlete on TV and

805
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,399
they're done practically not so many

806
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,320
Cheetos they don't go drink 100 beers

807
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,419
that's not what they're doing they're

808
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,039
watching videos of themselves to improve

809
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,480
themselves they're trying new diets or

810
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,740
new supplements so they can get better

811
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,059
they're asking advice they're doing

812
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,820
physio they're constantly owning their

813
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,100
craft so that they could be the absolute

814
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,039
best at what they do and you can do that

815
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,559
with code so how can we write better

816
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,779
code so you can train yourself on secure

817
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,640
coding practices so my secure coding

818
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,960
course is free now and we hack purple

819
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,640
Community it's free there's no upsell

820
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,260
there's no then we need you there's

821
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,880
nothing it's just free

822
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,980
there are many quality online sources

823
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,899
some are paid and some are free there

824
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,220
are a lot of different professionals I

825
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,720
know that create secure coding courses

826
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,279
that are awesome there's security

827
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,019
architecture there's current modeling

828
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,059
there's security and kubernetes like

829
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,799
there's everything under the sun and

830
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,600
there's a lot of things that are free I

831
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,399
had to train myself mostly for free

832
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,380
because I'm from Canada and our dollar

833
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,240
these were very little compared to the

834
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,500
American dollar and I worked for the

835
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,880
government and our training budgets were

836
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,460
80 bitty bitty and so I had to like do a

837
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,559
lot of Thrifty stuff so that I learned

838
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,480
and you can too

839
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,580
when you look for how to do something so

840
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,679
like when you go to stack Overflow 400

841
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,419
times per day instead of picking the

842
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,039
thing at the top which will be the least

843
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,159
secure way to do something

844
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,799
look for the most secure way to do the

845
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,600
thing and stack Overflow has a secure

846
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,840
area now like how to do this securely

847
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,600
look there instead spend instead of 30

848
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,340
seconds spend a minute and a half or two

849
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,500
minutes looking for the most secure way

850
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,960
to connect to a database the most secure

851
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,880
way to do whatever it is that you're

852
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,559
trying to do and your code quality will

853
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,000
go straight up

854
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,700
you can become the security expert on

855
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,840
your team

856
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,340
and you can be that person that always

857
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,720
knows the answer that person that always

858
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,000
helps and each new problem you settle

859
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,620
you're just building that muscle inside

860
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,980
your brain of absec and like I was not

861
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,840
awesome at it when I started I did all

862
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,519
the things that I tell dads not to do

863
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,860
now and I have learned and learned and

864
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,320
learned and I'm sharing it with you and

865
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,000
you can be just like that you can be

866
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,919
exactly like me and you can be on a Dev

867
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,380
team and be like yeah actually I had to

868
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,059
fix something like that last month can I

869
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,039
show you my code or could I tell you how

870
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,840
I did that or do you want me to help you

871
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,799
and you can become a security champion

872
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,019
and so what did we learn today we

873
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:06,120
learned in we learned insecure software

874
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,980
is a really big problem and we need to

875
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,539
take it seriously

876
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,640
we learned that pushing or shifting left

877
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,640
I mean starting security earlier ideally

878
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,860
right at the beginning of the system's

879
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,080
development life cycle and we learned

880
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,760
that secure system development life

881
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,179
cycles reliably every single time we'll

882
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,779
release more secure software and if you

883
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,940
just take home these three concepts like

884
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,200
we need to take software security

885
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,600
seriously we want to start it right at

886
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,460
the beginning of this system development

887
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,340
life cycle and that if we do do security

888
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,500
steps throughout that whole process we

889
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,840
will build better software that is safe

890
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,240
for our customers our employees or our

891
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,220
citizens and yeah I'm hoping that that

892
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,260
this message goes home with you and

893
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,240
especially goes to work with you

894
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,799
and with that I want to give you some

895
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,260
free resources so the books are not free

896
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,519
but the rest of the things are free

897
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,000
books cost money sorry so first I have a

898
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,200
podcast

899
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,519
so it's called the we have purple

900
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,980
podcast and we release it on YouTube and

901
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,619
then all the podcast platforms and

902
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,359
basically it offers short security

903
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,760
lessons and best practices this season

904
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,159
last season it was all about all the

905
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,480
different types of jobs and information

906
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,300
security and so we just released the new

907
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,159
one with this lady named Nicole Dove

908
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,960
before that was truth man sir we have

909
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,460
all these famous people on and they

910
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,159
teach us a little lesson

911
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,260
um these are awesome books including my

912
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,399
book

913
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,099
um I feel like we can't do security

914
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,940
right if we aren't doing it right and in

915
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,320
my opinion

916
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,179
if we want to build really awesome

917
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,099
software devops is the way so these

918
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,859
first four books in yellow are all books

919
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,780
about how to do devops and there's Parts

920
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,699
about security but it's not a security

921
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,859
book it's a devops book and then the

922
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,060
last book Alice and Bob learn

923
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,339
application security I wrote it and not

924
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,140
only do I think that book is awesome but

925
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,619
so does my mom and you might too

926
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:02,880
um I'd like to invite you to join the

927
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,500
community so all of the wehack purple

a day and basically you could just start

933
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,700
taking courses for free you can meet

934
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,560
lots of awesome other human beings who

935
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,480
are in there you can come to our events

936
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,520
you can come hang out you can write your

937
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,020
first blog article you can give your

938
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,420
first presentation this is a place where

939
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,460
we're hoping people feel that they can

940
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,180
be comfortable and supported

941
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,460
every Monday on Twitter I use this

942
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,619
hashtag cyber mentoring Monday and it's

943
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,300
it's Wednesday so you missed it this

944
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,680
week but don't worry we'll do it next

945
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,859
week and basically I want to help people

946
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,359
connect with professional mentors

947
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,339
because my first professional Mentor

948
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,220
told me some things but that led me to

949
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,599
meet a whole bunch of other people who

950
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,760
became my other professional mentors and

951
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,079
as my career has progressed and

952
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,400
progressed and progressed I've called

953
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,500
upon these people to help me and it has

954
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,359
been amazing and I've been able to go

955
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,460
significantly further with their advice

956
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,040
and so I wanted to help everyone find a

957
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,900
mentor so you can check this hashtag out

958
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,839
and when you're ready put a call out and

959
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,660
ask for help and the last resource is me

960
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,060
so I am a giant nerd on the internet I

961
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,980
have a Blog I have a YouTube channel I

962
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,140
have a newsletter I have a Twitter

963
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,760
account theoretically I have a Facebook

964
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,099
account but I hate Facebook so if you go

965
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,560
there you'll talk to my intern but that

966
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,260
said all these places I'll actually be

967
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,380
and with that I would like to thank you

968
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,260
so very much for your attention and your

969
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,000
time today thank you to grimcon for

970
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,560
having me and thank you to grimcon for

971
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,240
putting on this entire conference for

972
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,060
free because you as the person attending

973
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,339
have no idea how much work that they

974
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,859
have put into making this a reality and

975
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,660
so my hat's off to the conference

976
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,079
organizers thank you so very much

977
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,599
thank you Tanya wow that was that was

978
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,619
incredible

979
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,119
um

980
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,140
i i jotted a ton of notes good stuff uh

981
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,780
clearly the voice of experience

982
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,760
uh especially tempered by QQ I love Cube

983
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,020
unit that's great but specifically

984
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,420
getting permission in writing stuck out

985
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,579
to me I've heard so many horror stories

986
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,400
about that including people who should

987
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,859
have get a pass and not getting a pass

988
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,320
and spending years in prison for such

989
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,560
things

990
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,240
yeah thanks for uh great talking you

991
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,280
covered like the full spectrum there was

992
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,079
something for everyone in this talk

993
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,880
there was like if you

994
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,760
if the world did what you just described

995
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,880
um that would make my job a lot harder

996
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,099
and my company a lot less successful

997
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:52,680
you can relate to

998
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,680
yes I definitely can

999
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,480
I love your love your emphasis on

1000
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,780
mentors there's so much information out

1001
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,780
there but

1002
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,359
it's a relationship and make it so much

1003
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,700
easier to chew on and even know what

1004
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,560
what materials are important for this

1005
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,520
particular thing I'm trying for and yeah

1006
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,800
definitely definitely thank you for

1007
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,320
having me

1008
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,520
don't mind

1009
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,880
um so you you had a lot of a lot of

1010
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,619
great quotes that people were uh were

1011
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,079
facing the Discord uh the one about

1012
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,160
cheese stands out the cheese in the sun

1013
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,500
um a number of other things but I wanted

1014
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,540
to uh thank you for that there was one

1015
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,619
question that came in on the Discord

1016
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,540
here okay

1017
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,420
so they said uh they asked tiny you said

1018
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,740
you did pen testing for a year and a

1019
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,660
half can you talk more about this if it

1020
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,760
was a if this was a quick slash natural

1021
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,820
change both into and out of

1022
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,280
uh so it took me about a year and a half

1023
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,260
to be able to switch from being a

1024
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,180
software developer to moving into a

1025
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,579
full-time pen tester role so I was

1026
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,440
already learning about security a bit

1027
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,140
and then I decided you know my

1028
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,700
professional Mentor was like you're

1029
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,320
going to be a pen tester you're going to

1030
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,160
be great

1031
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,440
and I spent a year and a half studying

1032
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,780
and taking courses I started speaking at

1033
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,760
conferences around then specifically

1034
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,260
because I wanted to be able to get in

1035
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,780
free because I had no budget

1036
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,880
and so I discovered if you speak at the

1037
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,740
conference they'll let you in free and

1038
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,060
you can just learn for free and I'm like

1039
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,200
jokes on you I got in for free

1040
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,339
it didn't occur to me that I did a

1041
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,380
zillion hours of work preparing that

1042
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,099
talk but for me it was great and I also

1043
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,720
joined oh awesome started running the

1044
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,280
OAS community and I just started

1045
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,140
inviting people that would teach me the

1046
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,700
things that I needed to know to be

1047
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,780
speakers

1048
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,720
and so I took a long time and a lot of

1049
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,940
effort and my professional Mentor would

1050
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,380
like get me to do this and get me to do

1051
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,359
that and practice this and do these

1052
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,560
things

1053
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,180
um and I was working full time as a soft

1054
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,859
like leading a software development team

1055
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,440
at that point writing all the software

1056
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,839
uh well leading the team that wrote the

1057
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,339
software I wasn't really writing that

1058
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:03,780
much at that point

1059
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,339
and then

1060
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,619
um one day the security team where I was

1061
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,420
working said well we're going to hire

1062
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,760
someone for security it could be you so

1063
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,859
I ended up working on that team doing

1064
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,500
appsec and sort of pen testing and sort

1065
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,420
of like fluttering around I ended up

1066
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,099
being the CSO for a few months and

1067
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:21,720
running the security for the entire

1068
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,020
election across Canada in 2015 and then

1069
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,760
my mentor said do you want to be a

1070
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,920
manager or do you want to be a pen

1071
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,900
tester do technical work and I was like

1072
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,359
I want to do technical work so I stepped

1073
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,180
down into the pen tester roll out a new

1074
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,240
organization and I did pen testing for a

1075
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,880
year and a half and I was like this is a

1076
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,859
dumpster fire

1077
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:47,040
um and I basically like I was learning

1078
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,480
more and more about app sex so I just

1079
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,339
kept doing it at work and it made my box

1080
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,440
crazy it's like Tanya why are you

1081
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,380
spending so long and I'm like well the I

1082
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,940
had approved all these extra days and

1083
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,619
he's like why are you visiting them like

1084
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,480
four months before their pen test I'm

1085
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,220
like oh I Scandal their infrastructure

1086
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,020
and gave them a list of patching to do

1087
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,819
and I scanned like what they had for

1088
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:07,619
their app and I trap modeled it and he's

1089
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:08,819
like we don't have time for that crap

1090
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:11,160
I'm like they're willing to pay more and

1091
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,200
he's just like why can't you just go do

1092
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,760
the test and leave

1093
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,700
and I I made him really annoyed

1094
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,560
um because I felt like I couldn't leave

1095
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,020
I was like I had to help you fix this

1096
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,300
and I found it really distressing and

1097
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,339
it's hard to be a consultant rather than

1098
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:27,900
an employee if you've been an employee

1099
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,720
your whole life where you see that from

1100
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,460
the very beginning until the very end of

1101
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,619
the project and just coming in being

1102
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,900
like it's broken fix this and leaving

1103
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,960
was really hard for me and so

1104
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,460
um then someone said well what if you

1105
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,500
come over here and you get to do the

1106
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,839
entire life cycle with us and you get to

1107
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,380
know all the devs and like be just there

1108
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,200
for our devs all the time because

1109
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,640
switching companies all like every week

1110
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,579
it'd be a new company doing a pen test I

1111
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,800
just I I don't know I felt lonely and it

1112
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,599
felt like for me as a super extrovert I

1113
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,240
know regular people are fine with that

1114
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,800
um but I really like the idea of

1115
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,359
investing and seeing it from the

1116
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,359
beginning until the end and so basically

1117
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:13,680
one day someone's like you keep doing

1118
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,780
appsec that's what the problem is you're

1119
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,640
not doing pen testing Tanya you're

1120
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,740
trying to do the whole life cycle you're

1121
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,319
gonna get fired

1122
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,880
so I worked somewhere where that's what

1123
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,220
they wanted and it went oh I was a lot

1124
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,099
better there

1125
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:31,200
less frustrated with me which is good

1126
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,500
yeah no doubt no but it was hard it

1127
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,200
wasn't a smooth process and I had to do

1128
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,359
a lot of work for free to get attention

1129
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,460
so to get the pen testing job I did an

1130
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,859
entire pen test for them and he was

1131
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,119
still like no I don't think you have

1132
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,180
enough experience so then I remediated I

1133
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,460
patched all the servers I fixed the app

1134
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,800
so it was Secure and he was still like I

1135
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,119
don't know and then my professional

1136
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,180
mentors they're trying to hire him and

1137
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,579
he said I won't come unless Kanye counts

1138
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,680
and he like said he would refuse the

1139
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,540
contract and so they finally agreed to

1140
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,300
bring me on and so most professional

1141
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,800
mentors don't put themselves out there

1142
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,480
like that that was a really unique

1143
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,540
situation that I'm very grateful for

1144
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,020
um but yeah and then I totally ticked

1145
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,420
off the boss spending way too long on

1146
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,880
every contract but people would pay for

1147
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,119
the extra time to be clear but yeah

1148
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:27,599
well and this is such a even even this

1149
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,420
many years in hacking and Pen testing

1150
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,619
and and actsec are still so new and

1151
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,420
especially so new to the people doing

1152
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,540
them that there's a lot of there's a lot

1153
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,099
of things you got to sort out like that

1154
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:43,079
you you've got to have those bossy

1155
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,540
conversations about

1156
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,060
they're paying us for two weeks and

1157
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,040
you're giving them four

1158
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,160
um let's talk how to make that a reality

1159
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,040
you know let's make this yeah well I

1160
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,500
would just quote more days I'd be like I

1161
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,180
need 14 days and they're like that guy

1162
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,400
can do it in 10 days I'm like well that

1163
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,500
guy's senior and I'm Junior

1164
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,319
and then yeah they were just go along

1165
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:08,540
with it

1166
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,640
I mean I tell them what I was gonna do

1167
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,040
and they'd say that sounds good but when

1168
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,660
you are planning a pen test and you're

1169
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,460
planning out the scope most clients have

1170
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,020
no idea they're like sure you're the

1171
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,819
expert I guess that's right

1172
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,440
and I mean

1173
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,240
other pen testers are like why are you

1174
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,160
doing threat modeling they told me like

1175
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,780
whiteboarded their whole app and help

1176
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,160
them redesign it what are you doing

1177
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,079
Tanya that's not your job and I was like

1178
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,240
but they need that

1179
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,839
they do that's great yeah that's where

1180
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,520
business can get in the way of getting

1181
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,400
business done where it's all a people

1182
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,200
problem right and people happen to be

1183
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,780
part of the majority of the solution so

1184
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,579
the relationship can solve these

1185
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:49,200
problems whereas

1186
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,200
business needs the the rigidity factor

1187
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,480
of well they agreed they agreed to pay

1188
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,400
us this much and we agree to do this

1189
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,520
much when really working together we can

1190
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,500
do so much more I know that I pushed

1191
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,220
really hard with with grim sci-fi I I

1192
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,260
was fortunate enough to be able to start

1193
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,599
the Sci-Fi team here at Grimm and with

1194
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,740
all of my engagements I was always

1195
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,599
trying to push for

1196
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,520
well let's talk about relationship let's

1197
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,380
talk about uh

1198
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,960
us partnering with you this is not a

1199
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,819
transactional thing where you have you

1200
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,319
pay us we do this work and then we're

1201
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,119
gone but really

1202
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,700
we want to help you understand what's

1203
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,460
best what's next so we're trying to work

1204
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,800
that out trying to try to wrap all that

1205
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,720
together in a businessy package that

1206
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,359
actually makes people money too now it's

1207
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,740
so hard

1208
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,599
yeah so I got one last question and then

1209
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,079
we got to wrap up um for Al to take over

1210
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,480
here in about three minutes

1211
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,640
um as I said you've got a full spectrum

1212
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,160
talk something for everybody developers

1213
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,319
security Engineers all the way up to

1214
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,880
management like management would benefit

1215
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,020
from this

1216
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,180
how would you recommend developers and

1217
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,980
security Engineers engage other people

1218
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,359
in their organization with your

1219
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,460
materials and the concepts that you put

1220
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,440
here in the talk

1221
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,160
so I um so not this talk but a talk

1222
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,140
similar to this talk and then another

1223
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,099
talk about devsecops I open sourced them

1224
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:16,619
so I made so if you go to my GitHub so

1225
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:19,319
if you go to github.com she hacks purple

1226
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:24,180
and go to TTT so train the trainer I

1227
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,060
have two talks of mine that I've given

1228
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,900
like probably 60 70 times each

1229
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,660
um and basically I give you the slides I

1230
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,940
give you like a slide to introduce

1231
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,819
yourself I give you a description and

1232
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,500
then I give you a video of me doing it

1233
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,420
and then I give you a video of how you

1234
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,460
can do it so it's like on this side we

1235
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,900
want to convey this like here's a story

1236
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,460
you could tell or here's a question you

1237
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,380
might get and I walk you through the

1238
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,200
presentation so that you can give it and

1239
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,700
so then lots of people have told me

1240
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,500
they've given those presentations at

1241
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,319
work especially appsec people or pen

1242
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,940
testers because they're like I want to

1243
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,619
give a presentation but I don't have one

1244
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,060
it's hard to make a presentation I'm

1245
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,520
like just give mine it's free the

1246
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,740
license is just open for anyone to do

1247
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,420
whatever they want with it and some

1248
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,680
people have told me they've spoken at

1249
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,560
meetups or conferences with my talks and

1250
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,240
