00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,140
hello everyone I am Neil and I'm here

9
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,960
today to talk about how Russian cyber is

10
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,939
in my opinion offensive

11
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,920
uh and we're going to focus on looking

12
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,920
at the recent cyber operations conducted

13
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
by Russia in early 2022 really focused

14
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,040
in February before the ground Invasion

15
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,619
uh specifically February 13th through

16
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,000
16th

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,619
I want to give a first shout out to the

18
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:56,820
team that helped me put this together

19
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,880
they were working with me uh on a quick

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,219
time crunch to gather the data do the

21
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,840
analysis and get that report out so that

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,939
we could uh contribute to the larger

23
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,340
Community as well as Harden U.S and

24
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,919
allies from any other future Russian

25
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,339
attacks

26
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,140
so for today

27
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,099
um

28
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,739
the there's been a lot of events in 2022

29
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,200
uh January 13th we started with whisper

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,599
gate then we what we're going to focus

31
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,700
on today uh the denial of service

32
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,000
against the Ukrainian Banks and uh the

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,560
in the Ukrainian government on that same

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,540
day February 14th uh when it was

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,040
reported in the news through February

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,980
16th uh there was hermetic wiper wiper

37
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,560
wiper all the way down uh through March

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,599
and then we've even seen what we'll

39
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,480
cover right at the end is on March 28th

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,239
a uh a bgp hijack that was surrounding

41
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,739
Twitter and some Russian Telecom

42
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,340
providers

43
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,580
so just to start off here uh the goal

44
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,599
was

45
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,220
um we're going to look at the event that

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,500
occurred on February 15th uh it was

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,760
public knowledge of the Ukrainian

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,500
government sites were down for about

49
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,019
four hours and the banks the two large

50
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,120
banks in the financial sectors for the

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,519
Ukraine were were down were taken

52
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,140
offline and everybody immediately thinks

53
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,400
Russia right

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,780
um given the tensions the political

55
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,300
tensions over there Ukraine did report

56
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,519
this uh researchers were able to see it

57
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,159
uh publicly posted on Twitter with uh

58
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,920
spikes in bgp routing Network outages

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,099
and things like that but that was really

60
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,379
it there was uh there was reporting at

61
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,720
that big day hey Russians Russians are

62
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,519
doing this and then it really died off

63
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,980
uh there wasn't much reporting follow-on

64
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,260
research there was a few uh small events

65
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,200
that uh were reported and seeing they

66
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,700
didn't get any real public attention it

67
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,739
was kind of hey this went this there was

68
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,540
a network outage it's over and then they

69
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,220
move on

70
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,879
um and uh the the focus of this as well

71
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,400
was that if we can look at these kind of

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,920
large-scale events

73
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,239
um that we don't get a chance to see

74
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
very much very often uh that are so that

75
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,340
are so public and known uh we can better

76
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,260
understand the tools in the tradecraft

77
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,720
of those tier one adversaries and in

78
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,819
this case Russia and then use that to

79
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,799
work back kind of a know thy enemy

80
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,320
approach to uh defense so if you

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,639
understand what they're doing how

82
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,560
they're doing it based off of previous

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,120
attacks and things like that previous

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
tradecraft

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
um humans or creatures of habit they

86
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,639
have military orders of battle and we

87
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,500
can use that to better Harden ourselves

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,060
in the future

89
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,500
um so that was our that was our approach

90
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,139
for this uh this endeavor

91
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,360
um the open source reporting was good uh

92
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,040
it's interesting to see that pop up in

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,960
the news however you know it was just

94
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,360
this February 15th and then it was It

95
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
was kind of done they didn't really dig

96
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,540
any dig any deeper yes the outage was

97
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,340
there the ukrainians kind of fought back

98
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,259
and put it together and then didn't have

99
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,300
any have anything else and they they did

100
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,820
publish a list of of botnets it was

101
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,340
about 60 IPS I think about 80 if you go

102
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,220
through the whole community that uh were

103
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,800
hey these are the IPA addresses that the

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,120
government of Ukraine could see because

105
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,680
it was their systems that were hitting

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,539
them uh and they were you know let's

107
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,340
look back at these and profile them they

108
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,320
were all part of a variant of the Mariah

109
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,840
botnet and some other low-level common

110
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,880
botnets that were used and controlled

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,699
likely by Russian military forces to

112
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,520
support that uh offensive operation but

113
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,520
we look at it and uh I think we need to

114
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,160
go a little deeper into how it occurred

115
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,360
uh was there anything that happened

116
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
beforehand

117
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,880
was there anything that happened

118
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,560
afterwards

119
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,620
um uh what tactics were used if we could

120
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,600
understand the specific details and

121
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,580
tradecraft at a technical level

122
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,860
maybe we could thwart that attack or

123
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,560
kind of you know pull the switch on it

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,020
right right as it's starting to happen

125
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,300
um also were there any indicators that

126
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,919
that this was coming that they had to

127
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,060
prep that they had to get something in

128
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,400
place hours before even minutes anything

129
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,199
that would give us an edge to uh to

130
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,080
better defend uh against it um and then

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,819
how can we stop these from happening in

132
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,160
the future if we can configure or put

133
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,199
things in place that would nullify their

134
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,000
tactics without them being able to know

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
that or adapt

136
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,300
um and then having we see this as early

137
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,940
as possible knowing earlier is better

138
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,680
we we started to pull the data together

139
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
so with these questions with these

140
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,860
analytic questions

141
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,960
we brought in global netflow uh we

142
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,819
brought in passive DNS records we

143
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,340
brought in bgp uh history and routing

144
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,500
updates surrounding that time period

145
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,479
um there's about 122 million records in

146
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,940
total that we brought in uh to look at a

147
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,560
lot where the pdns and a lot were the

148
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,919
net flow but um that's what our team

149
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,960
kind of used we went all the way back to

150
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
December 1st in order to give a good

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,460
Baseline and a profile uh leading into

152
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,020
February and then we went as far as we

153
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,100
could uh into into March uh but we cut

154
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,539
it off right at the end of February for

155
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,699
the for the research here

156
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,560
um as we were turning out the report at

157
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
the beginning of March

158
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,699
all right so once again this was a great

159
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,259
uh graphic that we were able to pull

160
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,120
together uh that the team was able to

161
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,580
pull together fantastic here so we've

162
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,259
got on the top uh all of the larger

163
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,360
events that that occurred

164
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,940
um you know political and diplomatic um

165
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,940
we've got cyber military uh but the big

166
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,800
piece at the bottom you've got the the

167
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,960
graph that uh is is more than just eye

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,240
candy I can assure you

169
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,340
um but that is depicting at the bottom

170
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,680
where time fate we're lining up by time

171
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,380
the events in in public news whether it

172
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,599
be troops moving on the battlefield or a

173
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,000
cyber event or Parliament uh in Russia

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,460
making a making a move with technical

175
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,220
data so we've got that Spike on on

176
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,039
Monday the 14th that was a pdns attack

177
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,419
um that we were able to to witness

178
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,460
didn't have any news events kind of

179
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,500
stands alone but it was definitely an

180
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,900
anomalous Behavior coming right in uh on

181
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,940
the on February 14th against the banks

182
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,639
and then we also you can see the surge

183
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,979
in blue right around February uh 15th

184
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,680
and the 16th that's the high volume DDOS

185
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,300
that we all saw in the news but you can

186
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,979
see how long it lasted and then when it

187
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,199
when they eventually turned it off so

188
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,419
it's really exciting to see not only

189
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,960
what we expect to see in um from from

190
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,879
the news but we we confirmed that with

191
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,879
uh with technical data the one key piece

192
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,139
that I would pull out here is that that

193
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,780
red Spike uh was was a very directed

194
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,520
attacker we'll go into the details but

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,220
it that was 24 hours prior to you could

196
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,780
see in purple on the 15th of February

197
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,879
when the Russian Parliament identified

198
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,580
the separatist States as as States and

199
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,800
recognize them which kind of opens up

200
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,099
the gates for uh Russia taking action in

201
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,440
in the Ukraine and and they're not part

202
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,440
of Ukraine and Sovereign there so but

203
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,019
that was in action 24 hours prior to uh

204
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,120
the legislative body identifying it so

205
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Putin would Putin in the military were

206
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,820
actually taking what I believe we all

207
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,680
will classify as offensive military

208
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,240
cyber operations

209
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,240
um before their legislative body had

210
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,300
kind of uh recognized it separately so

211
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,740
that action independent of the

212
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,360
legislative body is just it's it's

213
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,399
interesting to see from a perspective

214
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,620
with technical kind of evidence so

215
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,000
that's that's something we were able to

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,860
pull out by by doing this kind of time

217
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,660
phase analysis

218
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,399
uh the three big events that we're going

219
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,620
to to go into today uh we're going to

220
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,540
start with the passive DNS

221
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,940
um uh on the the February 14th which is

222
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,640
a day prior to the DDOS attacks we're

223
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,959
going to look at the DDOS attacks in

224
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,300
detail uh we pulled out a few uh extra

225
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,640
nuggets when we when we looked at it and

226
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,100
then uh the uh

227
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,100
bgp manipulation of the the Twitter

228
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,279
hijack and the bgp manipulation at the

229
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,980
end of the DDOS on February 15th so when

230
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,300
we put all these together in dissect

231
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,920
them back we're able to start seeing the

232
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,140
toolkit that Russia was using uh for for

233
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,600
their operations

234
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,360
so for the first uh for the first event

235
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
first siege that we would call it

236
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
um what we've got on the screen here the

237
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,420
the graph is the passive DNS data so

238
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,060
passive DNS by volume and I do want to

239
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,519
highlight that this is a log graph so

240
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,279
any type of scale is an an increment up

241
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,320
is an exponential change so it's really

242
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,620
significant to see such a spike on a log

243
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,480
scale for this data so the key piece is

244
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,420
that we saw a behavior is that that zero

245
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,820
nine uh Greenwich Mean Time uh which is

246
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,860
actually 12 o'clock Moscow time there

247
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,300
was that drastic increase as you can see

248
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,519
in that blue Spike on the graph

249
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,440
um so it kind of like High Noon Russia

250
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,620
kicked it on uh and the the DNS traffic

251
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,420
that we collected we collected in two

252
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,180
parts so we had the dedicated Services

253
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,579
which are in green and those were like

254
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,680
the eyepiece dedicated to the banks that

255
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,880
are owned by the Banks they're within

256
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,459
their ASN within the Ukraine and then

257
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,800
both Banks were also leveraging

258
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,540
cloud-based services and the product

259
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,339
comments of them were supported by

260
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,800
Amazon and they were in Ireland at one

261
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
of the data centers there so

262
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,360
uh we we collected both but then looked

263
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,680
at them separately because they had

264
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,600
different behaviors when we were

265
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,820
approaching it but we saw this this

266
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,640
massive increase million exponent of a

267
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,339
million times uh more than what was

268
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,579
normal for the previous 60 days

269
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:16,800
starting on the dot at 905 or 9 to 905

270
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,660
based on the The Collection sensor

271
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,940
variance in time so but I mean it's it's

272
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,680
amazing to see that type of scale come

273
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,079
in right away I don't think we don't

274
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,820
assess like nobody was checking at that

275
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,200
time to see what actually happened but

276
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,839
there was no reported outages and they

277
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,100
they turned it off pretty quick after

278
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,140
that but as you can see

279
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,019
this the spikes are normally what uh you

280
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,760
you see when somebody's doing the DNS

281
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,380
enumeration or things like that so if a

282
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,360
red team comes in they're using a word

283
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,920
list and trying to enumerate a network

284
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,180
this is what it looks like so they're

285
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,060
not as sneaky as uh as people normally

286
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,339
think they are but you'll see the word

287
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,560
list uh with DNS you can in plain text

288
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,800
you can kind of see it and on here they

289
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,720
weren't actually just coming in and

290
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,700
using a word list and it wasn't a pen

291
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,440
test or something like that they were

292
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,139
sending messages in the in the in the in

293
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,360
the um the word list so remember from

294
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,920
the Hermetic wiper malware they actually

295
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,079
put in okay here's the White House and

296
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,420
Biden uh President Biden

297
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,980
um sending that kind of message in the

298
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,139
malware hard coding that I think they

299
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,519
also were doing that here you could see

300
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,600
that it says

301
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,880
ode VIP Corp like very important

302
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,100
Corporation VIP very important point

303
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,160
zero day to your address Private Bank uh

304
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,399
so they're definitely they're not only

305
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,320
sending a an overwhelming attack as an

306
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,760
intention they're kind of like writing a

307
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,079
message on the missiles as they shoot

308
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,360
them just like a you know fighter pilots

309
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,740
write missiles on the bombs that they

310
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,320
drop uh this is this is definitely a

311
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,300
tactic and a Telltale side of a

312
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,100
premeditated military operation and not

313
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,440
just a uh a uh you know kind of lower

314
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,060
level attack

315
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,279
what we would like what we did next was

316
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,079
we we took that time period where now

317
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,459
we're zoomed in

318
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,839
um instead of looking at the the couple

319
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,579
days there we zoomed right into that

320
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,160
nine o'clock to noon uh on the day of

321
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,740
February 14th and and what we saw here

322
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,760
we broke it out into five minute

323
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,700
intervals once again on a log scale uh

324
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,440
but in the middle of it it was kind of

325
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,279
interesting to see there was an 18

326
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,639
minute Gap so they were they were on uh

327
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,800
doing the doing the DNS enumeration at a

328
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,899
large scale for for about an hour and a

329
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,540
half stopped uh or an hour stopped for

330
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,980
18 minutes and then started back up

331
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,360
again so

332
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,220
you know as you're conducting a DDOS

333
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,839
it's interesting to see it's hard to do

334
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,260
it's not as easy as people think and so

335
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,600
um you know we don't know why this this

336
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,540
blur this uh you know kind of stoppage

337
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,540
came into play could have been the the

338
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,459
Russians kind of broke their own botnet

339
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,019
had to reboot it how to get it how to

340
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,820
get it going again could have been the

341
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,579
the Ukrainian Banks uh were responding

342
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,980
uh to to this attack and and started a

343
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,480
shift in load balance and and took their

344
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,760
systems offline and booted them back up

345
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,440
um it may have taken the systems offline

346
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,540
and then they came back up

347
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,199
um I don't I don't know uh we but uh it

348
00:13:58,199 --> 00:13:59,459
is interesting to see that there was

349
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,839
this Gap and then it turned back on

350
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,019
again so we will see stops and starts uh

351
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,040
uh again so I I do think it might be uh

352
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,600
on the Russian side of things where

353
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,620
they're

354
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,120
um coordinating this attack trying to

355
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,800
sustain it it's very difficult you don't

356
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,880
know how the Network's going to react

357
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,980
until you actually do it

358
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,800
um so there's a lot of uh adjustments as

359
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,880
you're conducting these operations

360
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,100
so this is what I pictured on that on

361
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,540
that day when when they tried for three

362
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,579
or four hours and and nothing really

363
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:30,720
happened there wasn't a large scale

364
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,060
outage so somebody had to call uh

365
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,279
President Putin and tell him that it did

366
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,740
not work and we need a new plan

367
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,100
um so uh that that's what I that's what

368
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,540
I picture I hope you all have that same

369
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,760
uh peace in mind

370
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,500
um but we'll move into the second the

371
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,420
second day the second Siege what I would

372
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,480
be maybe called Plan B so they they turn

373
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,639
to uh a distributed denial service

374
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,699
attack against the dedicated IP space uh

375
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,740
on on the 15th once again starting

376
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,959
around High Noon with with Russia um it

377
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,060
started to ramp up in Moscow time so

378
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,560
kind of the same piece you know High

379
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,000
Noon military operation let's kick it

380
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,560
off let's go

381
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,540
um once again a log scale and we saw

382
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,180
that exponential increase from about a

383
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,820
10 000 piece volume and then that that

384
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,560
really went up to right right at a

385
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,279
million times what uh what was was there

386
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,699
previously so a drastic draft increase

387
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,240
in volume at a very specific time and we

388
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,579
saw that sustain you know you can see

389
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,220
that sustained for for about 30 hours uh

390
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,779
it was there and then it just turned off

391
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,180
so with with the DDOS is you turn it on

392
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,040
you try to keep it going you make some

393
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,360
Network tweaks but then and then you

394
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,860
turn it off it's it's kind of it's

395
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,079
they're very hard starting stops very

396
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,540
easy to see so we'll discuss the bgp

397
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,860
event in detail

398
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,079
um on the following slides but

399
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,240
um I mean we saw the public reporting

400
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,920
that they were offline for about four

401
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,899
hours but we see the traffic here for

402
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,660
30. so that once again I feel like

403
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,759
somebody had to give him a call or face

404
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,519
to face and say glad it didn't work

405
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,980
um and then he says yet uh we're gonna

406
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,779
go to plan K and try something else so

407
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,240
they're going to continue to escalate uh

408
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,060
in that same pattern for finding

409
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,980
something that will bring down uh or

410
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,540
bring down the Ukrainian targets that

411
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,880
they're trying to take down

412
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,800
um the the last event

413
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,300
that we're going to cover in detail is

414
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,120
the bgp uh manipulation so that that

415
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,120
occurred at a very specific time uh on

416
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,820
that red line about 1300

417
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,860
um Greenwich Mean Time on February 16th

418
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,259
so in the final volley of their denial

419
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,060
of service attacks

420
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,160
um there was a notice and publicly

421
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,540
reported

422
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,740
um uh bgp stream hijack at 1330 where

423
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,320
the the traffic routed differently the

424
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,420
paths were changed and there was a

425
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,759
definitely A disruption in the uh in in

426
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,199
the operations it didn't necessarily

427
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,839
take the the sites offline again but it

428
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,639
was it was once again

429
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,440
um it was a notice network uh Network

430
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,160
event but the the key piece that

431
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,199
um I would like to highlight is that

432
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,839
though the preferred routes were in

433
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,699
green uh and then you can see the

434
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,000
alternate route once the uh prefix was

435
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,740
was announced in the hijack occurred in

436
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,579
red uh one this goes against every bgp

437
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,679
rule that is out there so it added to

438
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,039
hop into the path for no reason so it's

439
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,939
definitely a forced a forced action that

440
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,460
they took this was a Nigerian provider

441
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,039
that you know just announced the IP

442
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,620
space for the prevot bank so it really

443
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,799
had no purpose it had to have been an

444
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,600
intentional manipulation it just did not

445
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
happen to occur by accident if this had

446
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,720
been for load balancing uh purposes we

447
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,600
would have seen a loss of volume or loss

448
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,120
of traffic before the event the load

449
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,820
balancing shift in place and bgp across

450
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,760
the the internet react and and propagate

451
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,500
a different route and then the traffic

452
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,900
coming back online as you can see it was

453
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,880
very very quick it sustained at a

454
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,740
certain level and then it went up and

455
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,620
peaked again at a factor of a thousand

456
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,880
times what it was previously before

457
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,860
which was already over a million times

458
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,720
what it was previously so we're just

459
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,480
talking about huge loads of traffic

460
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,640
relative to a previous Baseline

461
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,100
um and it defaulted to a carrier with

462
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,559
Russian ties so the the telia character

463
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,360
is all over Europe it's one of the

464
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,059
largest but they have in Eastern Europe

465
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,179
started uh recently in 2017-2018

466
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,039
alliances with with the Russian

467
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,299
government providing Russian services

468
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,100
and enabling that sort of Eastern

469
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,419
European

470
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,160
um uh you know

471
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,380
areas that are that are affiliated with

472
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,600
uh and and pro uh Pro Putin and

473
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,240
pro-russia so that's not a surprise but

474
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,860
that also just indicates hey look this

475
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,140
was this was a this was an action that

476
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,539
uh that was an intentional for for

477
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:55,020
disruption and I the the crazy piece you

478
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,120
know if you wanna put on a little bit of

479
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,860
a tinfoil hat is the only other time

480
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,120
that we saw

481
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,000
this type of Route change from the the

482
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,700
traditional in green to adding telia as

483
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,640
a 12.99 ASN into the route for the

484
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,380
prevot bank and um and the other

485
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,140
Ukrainian Banks was on January 19th and

486
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,900
on January 19th there was a visit from

487
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,280
the U.S

488
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,059
um

489
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,780
uh a U.S the U.S Secretary of State came

490
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,400
to Ukraine on that day to meet with the

491
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,640
president of Ukraine so that's also you

492
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,580
know a big show of uh political force

493
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,620
from the the United States going to

494
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,880
Ukraine to meet with their president

495
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,000
given the height intentions at this time

496
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,240
and seeing the route change uh at that

497
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,919
point but nothing occurred I mean it was

498
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,200
definitely a pre-positioning and I'll

499
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
Circle back to point three where this

500
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,360
route was changed at eight in the

501
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,760
morning uh the day of the attack but

502
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,179
there was no impact and the the actual

503
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,100
the actual traffic didn't route over a

504
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,919
path that was you know

505
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,020
announced in Conflict until about six

506
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,480
hours later right so you change they put

507
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,220
the configuration in place at zero eight

508
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,020
in the morning and then they didn't

509
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,059
actually do what they needed to do and

510
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,000
flick flick the switch until 1300

511
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,620
um that afternoon and then they tried

512
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,299
for about an hour and a half before

513
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,220
calling off the entire DDOS in my

514
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,840
opinion when it went back down to zero

515
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,000
so that type of pre-positioning is a

516
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,980
true indicator of that something bad is

517
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,600
going to occur it's like it's like the

518
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,520
Calm before the storm kind of thing

519
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,500
everything gets quiet and something bad

520
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,179
is going to happen to see a prefix

521
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,039
change that starts to do this and you

522
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,260
add a route path something bad is coming

523
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,240
uh you know kind of

524
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,280
um you know grab the kids run down to

525
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,500
the shelter kind of thing but uh those

526
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,059
were some big points that came out and

527
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,159
this really showed what the capability

528
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,159
that the the Russians have being able to

529
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,140
manipulate backbone

530
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,080
um uh prefix announcements across an ASN

531
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,360
across two different continents and then

532
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,179
have that route traffic for your

533
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,240
purposes is a huge show of your

534
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,980
placement and access and a huge show of

535
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,600
the power that you can have if you

536
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,039
really want to inflict some damage going

537
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,140
forward

538
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,960
so let's take a quick break uh a lot has

539
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,419
happened uh since since February 16th

540
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:13,799
we've got a ground Invasion we've got

541
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,020
tons of sanctions more wiper ransomware

542
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,640
has gone have gone out we've got

543
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,720
boycotts from the West we've got

544
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
boycotts from Russia and boom the uh the

545
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,880
Iron Curtain is now back up so so this

546
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,240
is uh you know definitely a new

547
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,960
um

548
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,000
type of landscape for for the internet

549
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,700
uh that that we haven't really seen

550
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,080
before where they're kind of cutting

551
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,600
themselves off and um you know I wanted

552
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,280
to talk about some other actions that

553
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,159
came into the in place at that point so

554
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,500
um the the action that we want to

555
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,360
discuss is that there's a you know a

556
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,120
growing risk uh to U.S businesses for

557
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,220
the the collateral damage that is going

558
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,840
that can come into place when the Iron

559
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,059
Curtain goes up uh for the internet per

560
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,100
se so

561
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,400
um actions taken by a country to shelter

562
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,320
their citizens shelter their economy is

563
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,360
kind of a snuff back to the uh to the

564
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,280
other side so Russia trying to Snuff

565
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,020
back to the West

566
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,120
um or Western companies

567
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,460
um by blocking traffic for whatever

568
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,600
reason

569
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,640
um Sheltering their citizens for uh

570
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,039
censorship or things like that has can

571
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,419
have Ripple effects and collateral

572
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,419
damage or some people call cyber leakage

573
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,179
um uh outside of just Russia so they're

574
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,799
just taking an action in Russia kind of

575
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,740
within their bounds but it's actually

576
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,900
impact negatively impacting businesses

577
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,120
and other citizens outside of that

578
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,740
country so the case study we're going to

579
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,559
talk about was the the RT com Twitter IP

580
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,840
space that occurred on uh towards

581
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,320
towards the end of March of this year so

582
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,679
in case this this Siege number four

583
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,600
um announcing the Twitter ipspace was

584
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,760
was very interesting where you have the

585
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,380
normal route on the left where you can

586
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,960
see in red that's Twitter's uh ASN and

587
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,520
then there's just the collector that the

588
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,520
uh Cisco bgp stream has in place in in

589
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,440
Blues in that red line so that's the

590
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,940
normal route and then all these other

591
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,340
asns on on the screen there are just

592
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,080
kind of kind of operating as normal

593
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,520
they'll find the least path of least

594
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,960
resistance and they'll go to Twitter to

595
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,960
do their thing on the right you see when

596
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,720
it was hijacked at a very specific time

597
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,400
uh on that day you can see all the

598
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,980
routes are are going through uh in the

599
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,240
center there that's uh that's a Russian

600
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,220
Telecom provider and then you have rtcom

601
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,980
uh for for Russia as the final

602
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,539
destination in red that's now announcing

603
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,860
the Twitter IP space so essentially

604
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,960
everything in Eastern Europe and some of

605
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,340
those are Switzerland and some of those

606
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,820
are Africa those ascens are now instead

607
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,440
of going to the actual Twitter website

608
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,220
they're going to a uh a bad a known bad

609
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,220
um provider with rtcom so that new

610
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,600
direct route like diverted all the

611
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,820
traffic from Twitter

612
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,100
which which is a which which is which is

613
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,179
not good

614
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,640
um so they started doing that at 1206 uh

615
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,380
GMT

616
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,299
um you know Johannes Ulrich highlighted

617
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,640
that uh to everyone uh the question is

618
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,200
you know did this affect users outside

619
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,659
of Europe it really didn't

620
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,600
um the the bgp routes you know for

621
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,940
people in the U.S or Japan they still

622
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,200
got to Twitter because they were not

623
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,340
they weren't going to go to Europe and

624
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,100
then go back uh to to the U.S

625
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,220
um did this event impact uh businesses

626
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,279
outside of Eastern Europe so uh you know

627
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,260
conclusion yes and no so

628
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,400
um there are some businesses that

629
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,720
leverage that IP space for their

630
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,400
operations within Twitter uh

631
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,960
legitimately so

632
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,100
um if they were doing business with

633
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,779
Eastern European customers they they

634
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:32,340
lost that business they couldn't go

635
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,480
there they were going to the to the

636
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,740
Russian website and not to the actual

637
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,179
Twitter one

638
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,580
um but uh and then and then also you

639
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,580
know but the other sites if they're the

640
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,840
the customers that are not in Eastern

641
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,679
Europe if they're not doing business

642
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,880
there it's they're not going to really

643
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,679
see that impact

644
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,659
um you know we also asked was this a

645
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,720
configuration error by accident so very

646
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,980
unlikely I mean given the current

647
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,539
conflict in Ukraine it's most likely

648
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,880
that they they did intend to do this

649
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,340
um and also too that this wasn't the

650
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,679
first time that this exact IP block uh

651
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,559
was hijacked by uh was hijacked at all

652
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,020
uh it was also hijacked in the Myanmar

653
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,659
coup d'etat last year in February it was

654
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,340
hijacked during that to kind of shelter

655
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,779
that those citizens and from using

656
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,480
social media against the government so

657
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,100
um it's not the first time it happened

658
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,919
Russia was also very pro-myanmar coup

659
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,720
d'etat was was political support

660
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,679
financial and and Military so they may I

661
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,240
don't know if they gave them the idea

662
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,440
and then they were like then they use it

663
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,200
themselves or they held test it but kind

664
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,600
of odd to see it happen twice

665
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,320
um

666
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,960
in the same IP block at the same kind of

667
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,919
political contest in times uh but you

668
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:41,880
know we'll leave that for further

669
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,460
discussion at another time so why does

670
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,200
it why does this type of like sinkhole

671
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,720
or bgp hijack matter

672
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,279
um as more Western businesses are

673
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,140
publicly boycotting Russia and backing

674
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,120
out and divesting their their pieces

675
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,919
there Putin and the Russian government

676
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,299
are definitely getting angry and

677
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,039
retorting back Putin has even said it's

678
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,039
been a he's called it a uh an act of War

679
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,559
um so it you know in retaliation you

680
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,779
know Russia putting on our tinfoil hats

681
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,700
here like you know what what what what

682
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,039
could happen and and has started to

683
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,080
Russia starts to boycott back to the

684
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,520
last not allowing citizens to go to

685
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,919
those sites so how they do that they

686
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,179
have their iron curtain up and they just

687
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,100
block and sinkhole that IP traffic they

688
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,299
announce it they know that there's a

689
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,700
conflict but there is no like legal

690
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,559
repercussions for announcing specific IP

691
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,080
space right now that's not yours

692
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,880
um Russia decides to start announcing a

693
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,440
lot of Ip States for anti-russian

694
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,779
companies so they just start blasting

695
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,400
this out so that their users can't go to

696
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,600
legitimate sites because if you're in

697
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,799
Russia and you're trying to go to a site

698
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,140
in Germany or in the U.S you have to

699
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,279
pass through Russian stuff and they'll

700
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,620
just divert you off to the side so I

701
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,559
mean they could also escalate as they've

702
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,360
done in the past as we saw with the DDOS

703
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,520
and the pdns they escalate their attacks

704
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,080
over time

705
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,240
um and they if they did want to escalate

706
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,880
they can alter the lower lower

707
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,159
tier tables and providers with smaller

708
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,640
IP spaces and that will uh that will

709
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,860
likely have a negative impact across the

710
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,240
board widespread if they really wanted

711
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,240
to cause that type of problem so I use

712
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,520
the case study of 2019 like big

713
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,260
providers to talk about the big ones out

714
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,000
of San Francisco you know Amazon apply

715
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,679
for Facebook they were offline for about

716
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,720
for a couple hours because a small ISP

717
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,000
incorrectly announced ipv their IP

718
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,279
blocks um and it was propagated up so

719
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,440
that was that was truly an accident but

720
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,020
like you know I I put this out there

721
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,600
like who would win against a small ISP

722
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,260
right would if you put Russia and

723
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,080
Russian apt against a small-scale ISP

724
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,480
any of them Russia's just got to find

725
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,740
one and then they can do this

726
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,340
large-scale disruption so it's uh it's a

727
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,539
fairly you know uh it's a growing threat

728
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,340
I think it's something to to start to

729
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,260
think about and look into

730
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,500
um you know the the the actions that uh

731
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,600
Twitter has Twitter had in place did

732
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,779
minimize the the impacts they had the uh

733
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,360
um some pieces in place that you know uh

734
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,640
authenticate your IP blocks across the

735
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,679
the the routing chain so that they don't

736
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,399
go or it's called rpki and that protects

737
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,220
your IP space from getting uh hijacked

738
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,899
by somebody else so that the the damage

739
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:17,039
is minimal

740
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,059
um but you know those types of

741
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,620
recommendations would go into place to

742
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,059
harden your network because this is a

743
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:23,399
real threat coming from the Russians

744
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:26,520
um so the the big piece to take away

745
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,559
from this is that the threat actor

746
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,940
Russia in this case you know definitely

747
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,200
did escalate uh their pieces over time

748
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,179
um they're you know attacks were largely

749
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,460
uh unsuccessful from from what we could

750
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,679
see other than the four hour outage

751
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,539
um the PDS attack did not overwhelm the

752
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,720
servers but they did follow-on actions

753
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,159
and increase their kind of weapons

754
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,980
stores there they did that denial of

755
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,539
service attack

756
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,940
um you know the devices that they use

757
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,559
you know we found a bunch more as part

758
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,020
of those botnets about another 50 but

759
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,580
they were all you know small compute

760
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,500
micro ticks uh electric cameras things

761
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,240
like that that can't really provide that

762
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,100
compute and that Firepower to take

763
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,179
things down

764
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,500
um so they will likely you know maybe

765
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,600
shift to using just purchase cloud-based

766
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,299
infrastructure uh moving forward

767
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,700
um you know the the shift and the final

768
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,340
kind of like volley that they did do the

769
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,380
bgp manipulation which is like the the

770
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,360
huge piece that shows your access shows

771
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,399
your control and shows your ability to

772
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,620
really manipulate uh you know the

773
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,080
backbone portions of the internet is is

774
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,059
this is something to be highlighted and

775
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,039
concerned about as a as a new tactic and

776
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,539
a new method for military cyber

777
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,760
operations

778
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,860
um you know what do we learn wipers will

779
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,059
ransomware will always still be their

780
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,860
weapon of choice uh they were effective

781
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,320
they they they they they will you know

782
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,779
likely still be used in the future again

783
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,340
um but but these other attacks are

784
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,440
becoming more prolific and uh and and I

785
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,700
think they're gonna learn and evolve

786
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,440
from theirs as well

787
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,880
um as I said before they're unlikely

788
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,279
going to you know leave the leave the

789
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,960
large-scale botnets to Anonymous they're

790
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,279
really good at getting those to be

791
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,039
effective DDOS tools and mechanisms

792
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,779
um military might not be the best to do

793
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,059
that so using the cloud providers

794
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,320
um and making sure that you can have

795
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,799
like a 16 core uh CPU

796
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,480
um

797
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,039
high-powered CPU cloud from Amazon or

798
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,140
something like that to use in your

799
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,899
operations rather than uh try to

800
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,299
leverage a small scale IP camera

801
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,340
um I I do I do think and as we've seen

802
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,960
before as we were assessing at the

803
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,580
beginning of March that their internet

804
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,899
backbone attacks are going to become

805
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,640
more prolific and those are going to be

806
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,919
a growing tool in the toolbox and a

807
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,539
weapon of choice we did see that with

808
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:37,260
Twitter uh you know 28 Days Later so

809
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,940
um with what Russia was doing so that

810
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,740
that is definitely a growing threat and

811
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,299
a piece where we can take actions to

812
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,120
harden uh before the shields really go

813
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,620
up for uh

814
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,659
um the next large offensive

815
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,940
but I know there was a lot I appreciate

816
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,799
everybody's time today

817
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,940
um we'd love to follow up with any

818
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,039
questions in the chat

819
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,980
uh or offline please please uh find me

820
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,419
on Twitter things like that I'd love to

821
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,279
to keep digging in and hopefully this

822
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,320
was all helpful for everyone kind of

823
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,720
teach your interest and then also

824
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,519
