2
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,220
so

3
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:27,500
[Music]

4
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,479
hello and welcome to giving it all away

5
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,680
open sourcing security policies

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,600
i'm stephen sumleroff and today we're

7
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,640
going to jump into something that's

8
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,880
surprisingly fun

9
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,040
in a kind of masochistic way

10
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,799
but the goal here is to make it a little

11
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,479
bit more fun and a little bit less

12
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
masochistic so obviously we've got a

13
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,200
little bit of disclaimer so we've got um

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
all views are my own none of them

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
represent any other companies or people

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
that will be talking about today

17
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,600
of course

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
uh no this is legal advice none of it is

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,200
financial advice and of course nothing

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
pertains to any clearances that anybody

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
i speak with including myself may have

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,399
had or may still currently have so we

23
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,599
are at grim con 0 by 7.

24
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
look at that cast of characters i didn't

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
think i'd

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,560
well you know maybe five years ago six

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,599
years ago i didn't think i'd be on a

28
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,920
list with a lot of people up here but

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,360
surprisingly

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,239
hey look there's me yay

31
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,560
so here's a little bit about me

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
that's my linkedin

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
you can go look it up you're not here to

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
listen to me well

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
you're not here to uh

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,720
listen about me if you really want to

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
know

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,000
there's some security stuff and other

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,360
stuff hey look creds yay

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
what you are here to talk about is the

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,760
problem that i had at about two o'clock

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
in the morning

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
a few years ago

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
two o'clock in the morning

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,040
i had

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
an

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
immediate

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
requirement

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,800
to build a set of security policies now

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,239
the problem with this one is i didn't

51
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,840
have access to many of the other

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
security policies that i had used

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,239
previously i also because of this very

54
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,800
particular instance

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,959
i did not

56
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
have

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,280
access

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,200
to really

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,560
much of anything

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,319
it's kind of a weird cart blanche

61
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
scenario

62
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
and without any of those repositories i

63
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,360
didn't have access to paper pie i didn't

64
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
have access to much of anything and so

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
here i am at two o'clock in the morning

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,200
trying to figure out

67
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
how i'm gonna get this stuff in so we

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,720
can go land a new logo for the sales

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,080
team to make sure that they can win for

70
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,760
this particular client

71
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
because they need it and they need it

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
now

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,720
very quickly

74
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,040
so obviously it is that same thing that

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,319
anyone does

76
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,080
in this scenario is i said help me

77
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,599
google

78
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,080
started using my foo

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,519
and what i found through through that at

80
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,000
two o'clock in the morning

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
was

82
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,640
well it made me a little sad

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
it made me a little sad because as i was

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
going through and trying to find every

85
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,040
darn open source policy

86
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,238
on the market any any any policies like

87
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,600
okay i know where i need to go and i

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,358
know how to start but i i don't have

89
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,919
time to do all this together so what is

90
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,880
the fastest way for me to do this

91
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
of course inside of legal boundaries et

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,360
cetera

93
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
but there were

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,360
five main problems that i ran into

95
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
five main

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
problems that i ran into

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
that evening

98
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,400
the first one is many of the policies

99
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
that i found were just too

100
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
dang specific

101
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
they were too specific they weren't

102
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,199
policies they were almost like run books

103
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,720
and if they're run books they're not a

104
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
policy a policy should be a framework

105
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,120
that things fall under

106
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
not not a run book

107
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
the second problem was the inverse too

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,320
general

109
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,919
this is our security policy and we shall

110
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,198
follow it period the end

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,800
i mean they were a little bit a little

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,919
bit better than that but they were far

113
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,520
too general

114
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
we need something that's in between

115
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,520
and

116
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,039
also many of them were unusable

117
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,720
and this is this is one of the issues

118
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
that i see all the time

119
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
all the time whether i'm out with

120
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
clients whether i'm helping build a new

121
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,759
program

122
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,199
is

123
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,160
you have a policy that either

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
well let's just be real

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919
you read through it you go no one's

126
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,160
actually going to use this right and if

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,479
it's not usable then it's a dust

128
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,520
collector

129
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
it's sitting over there on top of your

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,840
as400 somewhere just collecting dust

131
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,120
also

132
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440
as400 still need to breathe so please

133
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
take the policies off them

134
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,120
put them on the shelf next to them maybe

135
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,759
fourth problem

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
not applicable

137
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,479
not applicable whether it's be due to

138
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,560
geography

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,039
a different region a different sets a

140
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,560
subset of

141
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
of procedures or compliance or something

142
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
else that just made them not applicable

143
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,479
to what we're working on

144
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,479
and then of course i've already

145
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,520
mentioned it

146
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
the fifth one

147
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,319
didn't want to pay

148
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,600
i don't

149
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
like paying for things if i don't have

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,759
who and i know that many of you

151
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,240
don't either

152
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,479
also especially because you're buying

153
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,120
something you don't know the outcome

154
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
and i've seen tons of policies out there

155
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,840
that just are paid policies you know

156
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,600
thousands of dollars

157
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,080
and you get it you look at it and you go

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,759
uh

159
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,800
how about no and that takes us back to

160
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,560
not really applicable or unusable

161
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,520
because you don't always know what

162
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,199
you're paying for

163
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,360
and so that made me go on an emotional

164
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,720
journey again at two o'clock in the

165
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,000
morning which was i was in denial

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,840
how can i how can there not be this

167
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,560
thing that should be easy right

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
and at that point if i'm remembering

169
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
right like sans had some they don't have

170
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
the great repository that they they do

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,680
now

172
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,560
and i started to get frustrated

173
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,919
in fact

174
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,080
i started to get angry

175
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,800
and when i get angry i tend to have a

176
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,280
well we'll say a response that's about

177
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
building things and fixing them and just

178
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
solving the problem and helping other

179
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,680
people

180
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,720
uh

181
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
because

182
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,599
as i was bargaining

183
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,280
about this

184
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,039
both with myself and with google at the

185
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,840
time

186
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,280
you know i thought

187
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
there's got to be something better out

188
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
there and then of course since it's two

189
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
o'clock in the morning is already tired

190
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
i get a little depressed

191
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,160
man i really have to do this

192
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
i'm really going to build the thing that

193
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
i want myself

194
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,759
i could go buy it i don't want to buy it

195
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,759
all right well

196
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,120
then obviously the next step is

197
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,879
acceptance

198
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
i guess i'm doing this and if i'm going

199
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,560
to do this

200
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,120
then it's probably time

201
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,840
for me to roll up my sleeves

202
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,560
and

203
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,360
get

204
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,479
ready to go

205
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
let's do this

206
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,960
so i started writing

207
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,560
and

208
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,879
writing

209
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,720
and

210
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
writing

211
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,519
and victory

212
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,640
so

213
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
that particular client

214
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,080
because what we wrote we got it through

215
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,799
it

216
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,959
met all of the needs that their clients

217
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,200
who were doing their third party risk

218
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,519
needed them to do

219
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,880
so we got it in

220
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,839
we won

221
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,240
right did we

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
well

223
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,279
obviously now that i've got this great

224
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
build thing that i can now reuse and

225
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,560
recycle

226
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,600
unlike

227
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,880
previously

228
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
reasons

229
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
let's recycle and reuse it

230
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,279
let's recycle and reuse it let's

231
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,680
wash

232
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
rinse

233
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,519
and repeat

234
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,120
so that's what we started doing

235
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,200
we started wash rinse repeat

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560
recycle

237
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,399
and reuse and

238
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,240
i say we because i got to bring in some

239
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,839
big guns on this project

240
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,440
now many of you

241
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,600
happen to know the military background

242
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,480
thing um

243
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
a lot of people in the military spend a

244
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,440
lot of time writing a lot of policy

245
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,680
so i brought in

246
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,360
sean iyer and adrian tilston who

247
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
both

248
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
similar to me west point backgrounds

249
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,959
uh i was electrical engineering they

250
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,720
were both computer science and we

251
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
started making it better

252
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,839
we started making it better

253
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,040
because we were working on some clients

254
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,519
together and we could we could do that

255
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,880
right

256
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
because

257
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,680
continuously improving the position that

258
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,279
we're in

259
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,240
so

260
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,279
if you don't know sean iyer and adrian

261
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,600
tilston i recommend you go to linkedin

262
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,720
and connect with them so here's shawn

263
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,839
he's got a great company that does great

264
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,920
work admirable work for a great cause

265
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
and

266
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,320
adrian tilson

267
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,399
great guy

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,160
period

269
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,000
great work

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,399
period

271
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,399
so we did this work right

272
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,680
now we built it into something that we

273
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
could use

274
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
and initially

275
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
i started using it as a a leverage point

276
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
for professional services hey we've got

277
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
this thing i was doing kind of what the

278
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
big guys did right

279
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,760
except to start instead of charging you

280
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,120
unlock all these free things with a

281
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
hundred thousand dollars to spend

282
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,640
or you unlock all these three things

283
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,600
with a 30 000 spend or you just

284
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
you know spend a few

285
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,720
maybe tens of thousands of dollars in

286
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
pro services to

287
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,680
to come build the thing based off of

288
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,000
something else

289
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
we're doing a little bit different

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,760
said okay

291
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,839
two thousand dollars pro services just

292
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,680
just unlock it

293
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,880
and then we said

294
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,320
well

295
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
what if

296
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
what if you do something else

297
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,000
but

298
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,279
life happened

299
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
and it wasn't until i was

300
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,600
sitting with a marketing team

301
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,640

00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,760
couple other people wondering if we

340

341
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
that we're making a couple clients paid

342
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,279

and we just give it away

346
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,360
as part of our seo plan

347
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
so we put on the glide path

348
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,399
did some

349
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,079
evals on it a little bit said do we

350
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,760
think this will work and the answer was

351
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,600
actually yes

352
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,800
so we got approval

353
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,399
to go through

354
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,200
and

355
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
give it away we want to make sure that

356
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,880
we give it away

357
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,000
so

358
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,480
we put it out

359
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,399
and stratacore thankfully

360
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,560
thank you stratacore

361
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,880
allowed us to go take all that work that

362
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,440
we did and publish it open source

363
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
incredibly permissively

364
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,839
mit license

365
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,480
under the mit license

366
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,800
unrestricted use

367
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,839
so that way

368
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,360
it all becomes yours now it's not mine

369
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
it's not ours it's yours because it

370
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,279
belongs to the world

371
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,079
because we were able to open source it

372
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,279
which is awesome

373
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,880
and i'm so excited that we were able to

374
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,000
do that and then of course

375
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,920
anytime you open source

376
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,040
uh

377
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
especially when you're looking at you

378
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,120
know

379
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,800
multiple organizations being a part of

380
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,399
this between uh sean and me and adrian

381
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,519
and some of the other clients that we're

382
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,440
supporting at the time and

383
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
how it all fits together in this weird

384
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,639
ecosystem obviously it's not just going

385
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,160
to live on a website

386
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,720
and where do people in tech put things

387
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,040
where do people in tech put things that

388
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800
you know they may want somebody else to

389
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,320
contribute to

390
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,040
or make it easy for you to find

391
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,279
well

392
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,240
obviously the answer is github

393
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,600
so

394
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,560
we said

395
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,360
it'll live and be maintained

396
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,480
on github

397
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,440
and we'll do it under sean's non-profit

398
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
or ricky security so that's why it's

399
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,880
over here

400
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,079
that's why

401
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,480
when you go to find it

402
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,000
you can get it off strata course page

403
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,440
but that's not necessarily the most

404
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,320
up-to-date content you can get it here

405
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,760
on github where it is i'll say the most

406
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
up-to-date because it is still something

407
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,079
that we do to help the community it's

408
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,160
not something that we're paid for so

409
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,839
be the change you want and contribute if

410
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,959
there's things in there that we need to

411
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,360
help with and we do need help because it

412
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
doesn't belong to us it belongs to the

413
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
world at this point

414
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,079
so now i'll go ahead and shift a little

415
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,000
bit here

416
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,560
i'm going to want to share

417
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,518
this screen

418
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,758
so let's walk through some of it

419
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
let's walk through

420
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,040
one of the babies

421
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,880
that is this project

422
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,720
and we think it's so fundamental

423
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
especially to drive change at an

424
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,600
organization that we called it project

425
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,959
keystone

426
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,639
the most important stone when you're

427
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,600
building a foundation the keystone

428
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,759
because we want it to be available and

429
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,600
easy for you to use

430
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,160
we want you to be able to use it so you

431
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,920
don't have to go through

432
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,600
the five stages of grief that i had to

433
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,320
do at two o'clock in the morning

434
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,680
so it's here

435
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,880
now let's jump into it a little bit

436
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,519
enhance

437
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,880
so

438
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,399
this is the main page landing page when

439
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,560
you get to project keystone right

440
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,279
and we put it right here rising tides

441
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,360
lift all ships

442
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,279
and we want to rise the tide

443
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,800
to buoy

444
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
all of you and what it is that you're

445
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,600
doing

446
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,759
so as we jump into it

447
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,920
let's just talk about some of it

448
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,759
so

449
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,320
we believe that we have you know done a

450
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,680
good job of making sure that we

451
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
highlight where we got the majority of

452
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,440
the information and if you find

453
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,720
something that we had forgotten to

454
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
attribute to the many versions please

455
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,319
let us know so we can fix that we're not

456
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,000
in the business of plagiarizing it

457
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
should all be either very well

458
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,559
documented or

459
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,599
um

460
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,959
uh

461
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,480
completely

462
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,000
and utterly changed because there's so

463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,199
many aversions that we've gone through

464
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,280
and we've we've talked to so many

465
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,679
professionals out in the field uh in

466
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
order to get to this point

467
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,880
um

468
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,760
yep

469
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,880
free and permissive under under mit

470
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,160
and let's talk a little bit

471
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,720
about how to use this thing

472
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
i'm wondering if i

473
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,280
can we make it bigger aha we can

474
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,280
so first thing you need to know before

475
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,559
you start writing a policy for the

476
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,720
company is what the heck does the

477
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
company do why does it exist

478
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,520
is it a non-profit in the healthcare

479
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,000
space is it a for-profit fintech company

480
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
i can't tell you that you need to check

481
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,679
that first

482
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,240
you need to jump into it because the

483
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
policies that you like literally you're

484
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,160
telling the company what to do through

485
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,240
these policies

486
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,440
so it has to be applicable to them

487
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,240
it has to be actionable

488
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
and it has to be a way that's consumable

489
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,960
and in a way that they'll follow it

490
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,200
so step one is start by reading it and

491
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,039
understanding it i know that sounds

492
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,799
crazy but i can't tell you how many

493
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,240
questions we get often

494
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,960
because well as you know

495
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,840
too long didn't read

496
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,159
now

497
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,960
here's the deal

498
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,919
this set of policies

499
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,039
is for basically security and i.t

500
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,520
it has a lot of crossover

501
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,039
but what you have to be careful on

502
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,320
is

503
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,000
working through things like especially

504
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,840
the employee handbook

505
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,360
because

506
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,559
first off you don't want to put

507
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,520
counter-intuitive things

508
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,080
if red then blue no no no if blue then

509
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,320
red

510
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,760
remember it has to be actionable

511
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,960
so you probably have to read things like

512
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
this and almost every time every time

513
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,280
i've done this you know i've talked with

514
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
the hr or the client and they'll say

515
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,960
something like ah yes our employee

516
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
handbook

517
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
it's under revision

518
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,200
oh

519
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,559
okay well can you at least give me the

520
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,200
most recent version um and any changes

521
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,880
in errata so we can drive it should

522
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,360
still get us close enough

523
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,320
um

524
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
because unless there's any major changes

525
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,200
like moving into a new region new

526
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,039
compliance headquarters moving somewhere

527
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,080
else

528
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,240
bringing on uh

529
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,480
i mean a lot of it's regional based or

530
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,280
or also complaints vertical face

531
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,799
you get it

532
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,320
make sure that these are either

533
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,720
subordinate to or it will help go back

534
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,559
drive some leader pieces

535
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,600
um

536
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,400
like the acceptable use policy

537
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,160
probably shouldn't actually be in this

538
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,440
handbook

539
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
uh in the policy set that should

540
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,720
actually probably be over in the

541
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
employee handbook so

542
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,200
make sure they mesh

543
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
now keep in mind

544
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,679
this

545
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,960
should be a document that drives change

546
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
for the company that you're working with

547
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,960
so you gotta be pretty damn judicious

548
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,480
about how much change you're going to

549
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
drive and how quickly

550
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,158
because change can be a business risk

551
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
i'm going to say that again change can

552
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,840
be a business risk

553
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,200
and there have been times when i've

554
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,760
actually recommended to clients that

555
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
uh that they literally split their

556
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,400
company in two

557
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
that's not a security change stefan it

558
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,640
absolutely is because this client set

559
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,559
that you just brought on

560
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,520
they require so much lockdown

561
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,400
that if you do that we can expect 10

562
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,720
of your engineering team your dev team

563
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,240
to to leave within probably 18 months

564
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
and if that's the case

565
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,559
10 of your engineering team

566
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,200
times the recruiting fees to go replace

567
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
them

568
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,240
that's tough

569
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,919
company

570
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,840
actually followed those recommendations

571
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,679
and they split off and they were able to

572
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,799
have a pretty awesome revenue

573
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,840
investment

574
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
at roi

575
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,400
because we were very judicious when

576
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,120
defining change

577
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,039
now some of the other uh

578
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,799
external trackers and things and we'll

579
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,480
jump into those in a minute so stay

580
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,200
tuned um

581
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,480
if we don't have a reference for them in

582
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,400
the year that's fine you can build them

583
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,200
go for it uh if you do and we're missing

584
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
it please hand it over we'll get you

585
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,120
credit and uh

586
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,159
you help build your brand and remember

587
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,080
these are not technical run books

588
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
right they're not super super narrow

589
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,480
these are policies they don't tell you

590
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,559
which unified endpoint management system

591
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,640
to use they tell you that you need a

592
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
unified endpoint management

593
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,559
formerly known as mdm

594
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,760
so

595
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,840
just remember that make sure make sure

596
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,000
anybody else important at the company

597
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,080
reviews these before you just stamp it

598
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,360
right

599
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,000
because you don't want legal coming back

600
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,280
and having a problem because of

601
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,480
something that you may have you know

602
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
recommended

603
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,280
so um

604
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
let's talk a little about what's in here

605
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,280
so if you jump into it

606
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,159
uh you can download right here the uh

607
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,799
the original base document in word

608
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,760
um

609
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,600
yeah i know it's word give me a break

610
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
that's what we had at the time

611
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,480
but tony givenelli also built it out and

612
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,640
uh in mark down uh we've got some

613
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,919
updates to do around that because not

614
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,520
all the the tabbing

615
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,080
was uh was you know converted over well

616
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
give us a break guys we're working for

617
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,679
free

618
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,440
and then of course um

619
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,600
you know the markdown and what tony did

620
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,760
also is he he went through and built it

621
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,919
out in latex so just massive shout out

622
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,559
to tony giovanelli for his work on this

623
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,440
uh part time as well um you know

624
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,799
volunteer time

625
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,919
uh just

626
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,919
dude much respect for doing a lot of the

627
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,280
work that we did we didn't have time to

628
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,960
do so uh

629
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,080
let's jump into it a little bit right

630
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,039
so

631
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,919
here is the uh the markdown policies and

632
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,600
again you can tell in here

633
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,080
um like scope a and b those should be

634
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,480
bolted out yeah fine whatever

635
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
but

636
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,919
it's it's all here right you can jump

637
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,840
through it it's pretty long

638
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,000
let's jump into now

639
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
the latex version

640
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,600
a little bit easier to read for you

641
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,720
right

642
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
let's go ahead and jump in if i know how

643
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,000
to actually

644
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,919
scroll here we go

645
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,480
so the way that we work this

646
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,960
we have the overall policy

647
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,520
why does this thing exist what does it

648
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,320
do what's the scope enforcement terms

649
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
policies exceptions gotta have

650
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,000
exceptions right most of us have an

651
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,440
engineering background gotta have

652
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,279
exceptions what the documentation

653
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,720
control looks like then supported

654
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,120
policies so this this is the base

655
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,240
document this tells you where to go

656
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,480
and and all the appendices from here

657
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
flow back to this and this should nest

658
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,279
tightly again with those other things

659
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,799
like the employee handbook any vision

660
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,720
mission value statements for the company

661
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,760
like

662
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,679
nest it well

663
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,919
and then of course down here step one

664
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,520
we've got our information information

665
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,799
classification handling and retention

666
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,360
policy so what type of information we

667
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,679
have how do we split it up who gets to

668
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,000
access it and how long do we keep it

669
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,360
because that's a lot of intellectual

670
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,760
property so let's jump straight at the

671
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,679
intellectual property make sure that

672
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,480
we're doing right by our clients

673
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,159
then of course

674
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,200
we have incident management policy

675
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
and the process this is one of the few

676
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,480
times in here that we actually included

677
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,400
a process because it's so darn important

678
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,840
to make sure that you've got the

679
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,760
policies and processes defined for

680
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,520
incident management we'll jump into that

681
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,440
just briefly here in a minute

682
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,279
asset management policy

683
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,960
what do we have

684
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,120
how are we doing that how are we doing

685
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,200
inventories how often

686
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,000
yadda yadda aup

687
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,400
again it's it's we've got it here for

688
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
you it should probably be over in the

689
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,919
employee handbook

690
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
uh change management change control

691
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,520
super important

692
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,840
remote work policy i think that's a

693
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,960
stubbed out one for in here uh because i

694
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,679
believe that one uh uh we

695
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
we pushed it back to uh

696
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,080
employee handbook as well

697
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,960
uh

698
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
security awareness program policy you

699
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,159
know pretty pretty boilerplate there

700
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,840
like it's an entire page says we need to

701
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,919
have one tells you how long to do it how

702
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,200
often that training is then you know

703
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,799
some things to look at business

704
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,880
continuity policy and plan

705
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,360
everybody's you know just exercised some

706
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,520
form of this during uh

707
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,960
the coronavirus

708
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,240
and then

709
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,400
technical security policy so this is

710
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,159
where many of you

711
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,600
i think within with the engineering

712
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,200
backgrounds or the technical backgrounds

713
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,120
you're going to love this part here

714
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,039
because it'll it'll resonate strongly

715
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,400
and then of course reputation management

716
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,840
system lifecycle management those are to

717
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,480
be published

718
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
so

719
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,760
we start off here with the company

720
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,520
statement

721
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,240
uh the policy statement right and what

722
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,480
what is the purpose of of these

723
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
guidelines in policy

724
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,679
it's to help the company execute their

725
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,200
mission

726
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,440
so you start by putting

727
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
your clients mission statement in here

728
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
or your own mission statement if you're

729
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,320
writing this for your own company

730
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
so just go through and read this right

731
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
just you go through you start working on

732
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,120
it roles and responsibilities you

733
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,039
we believe that or at least hope that

734
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,159
some people

735
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,760
will read this or at the very least it

736
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,679
gives us some training for the company

737
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,279
we start with a ceo

738
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,480
because this needs to come from the top

739
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,279
down

740
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,679
the cizzo legal

741
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,400
internal audit i t team office manager

742
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,279
privileged users and then racy i wanted

743
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,720
to get to racey right here because it's

744
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,559
very important

745
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,320
if you don't have a project management

746
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,480
background

747
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,600
responsible accountable consult and

748
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,840
inform

749
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,320
responsible accountable consult and

750
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,679
inform very important to say

751
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,960
who does what who is

752
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
responsible for doing the action

753
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,399
and then who is accountable that's

754
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,399
usually the next step up to say hey

755
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,919
person that's responsible are you doing

756
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,760
it who needs to be consulted through a

757
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,960
process and then when the process is

758
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,159
complete it runs a new problem who's

759
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,000
informed

760
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,399
you how to get a good racy document in

761
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,960
you're gonna be cooking with fire

762
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,039
i'm telling you it's

763
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,480
it's actually drives a lot of changes

764
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,000
very very good

765
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
so we'll skip through some of this one

766
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,880
of the things i did want to highlight if

767
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,960
we go all the way down to the uh the

768
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,600
incident response piece

769
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,960
is

770
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,520
like the difference between

771
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,880
uh

772
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,799
who like what is an event and what is an

773
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,360
incident we've got that outlined pretty

774
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,840
well in here we've got outlined who who

775
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,520
does the triage team

776
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,200
um how do you do communications for your

777
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,840
pace plan pace is primary alternate

778
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,039
contingency and emergency communications

779
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:15,919
i don't think we actually get that

780
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,840
spelled out so i'll take that note

781
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,600
um

782
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
and then who are the people that we need

783
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,640
to talk to

784
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
do we have an msp do you have an mssp

785
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,880
local provider local fbi cert web

786
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,360
hosting insurance all of that in here

787
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,480
right

788
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
um

789
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,760
and then how do we do this how do we do

790
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
triage escalation if something happens

791
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
and we do get to the point where now

792
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,240
we're in an uh we've gone to an actual

793
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,440
incident

794
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,320
we've got our incidents defined

795
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,559
and what do we do how fast do we need to

796
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,760
do that

797
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,840
it's it's all in here and then we've got

798
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,600
some steps to take when there actually

799
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,240
is uh an incident like oh talking with

800
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,080
your marketing team make sure they know

801
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,279
how to do

802
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,799
messaging management

803
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,799
get that out to the team and

804
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,039
go fast get ahead of it

805
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,120
release it quickly i mean it's

806
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
all the same standard stuff

807
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,399
so

808
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,200
uh go go check it out

809
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,799
now i'm going to bring up carlotta real

810
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,600
quick as well because this ties into a

811
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,880
lot of the conversations that i have

812
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,039
quite often um

813
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,960
just github carlota show me the money

814
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,559
oftentimes

815
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,640
this kickoff of building out programs

816
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,240
and policies one of the first things

817
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,880
that a a v cesar will have to do

818
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
and as as i coach people as they try to

819
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,399
become a vcis or

820
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,240
go a little bit higher faster move up

821
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,159
the food chain a bit um

822
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,159
we talk about we talk about deep getting

823
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,159
deep into policies because it defines

824
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,399
change it's programmatic etc

825
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,360
um

826
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,520
carlotta does an amazing job i recommend

827
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,360
this is the second piece of it

828
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,200
and it's it's all about

829
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,080
um how you do your eval

830
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,880
how you do your eval for a company

831
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,240

how do we drive change how do we get

834
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,320
better

835
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,760
and then of course building out a road

836
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,960
map

837
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,559
so go check out carlota stuff uh this

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,840
we use it all the time uh carlo and i

840
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,120

841
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,399
you'll get some updates in there there

842

854
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,760
personality for it because it's it could

855
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,520
be that completely different than what

856
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,799
you expect right

857
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,120

858
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,399
of those githubs

859
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,720

860
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,399

866
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,840

security

868
