00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,579
with us today Siddharth is the supply

9
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,140
coordinator at uh Paramount

10
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,420
rehabilitation services he enjoys

11
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,100
learning about programming and malware

12
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,020
analysis and graduated from Delta

13
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,460
College with an associate's degree in

14
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,860
General Studies in 2019 and graduated

15
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,380
from a grand circus.net angular boot

16
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,899
camp this past February and Sarah's free

17
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,180
time you can find them in a bookstore

18
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,560
bookstore looking for something

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,420
interesting to read or in a coffee shop

20
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,700
drinking tea so we really appreciate

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,740
your time Siddharth and uh take it away

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,360
all right sounds good yo oh my name is

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,560
Siddharth

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,719
um you guys can just call me Sid

25
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,240
um and uh yeah my presentation is on

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,520
dissecting agent Tesla so let's just get

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,879
into it

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,500
all right so before we start just give

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,420
you guys a bit of an outline we're first

30
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,580
going to talk about

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,680
um malware analysis in general and how

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,599
it works

33
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,700
um we'll then cover a brief history of

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,080
agent Tesla from 2014 to 2022

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,420
um following that we'll discuss

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,040
really quick just its ID and

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,239
characteristics

38
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,980
then we'll roll into the automated

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,480
static

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,260
um

41
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,840
automated static and then Dynamic slash

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,640
behavioral analysis

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,980
uh move on again really quick to uh

44
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,959
indicators of compromise

45
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,239
go over ways to defend yourself against

46
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,300
it which are pretty simple

47
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,160
um common targets and then talk about

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,920
why recently in the past few months and

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,319
also throughout a little bit of 2020

50
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,739
it's been coming back so

51
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,420
here we go

52
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,239
so what is malware analysis well before

53
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,060
that what is malware so

54
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,840
um

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,659
malware is short for malicious software

56
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,019
and network analysis is the process of

57
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,480
examining a malware sample to determine

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,580
what it can do in the develop counter

59
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,379
measures against it

60
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,239
there are several stages of analysis

61
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,099
Depending on time available

62
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,379
the skill level the researcher detail

63
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,400
needed

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,500
and the size complexity of the sample

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,319
foreign

66
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,659
analysis stages are

67
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,940
the first is fully automated which can

68
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,120
include static dynamic or both

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,760
then there's manual static analysis

70
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,040
that is manual Dynamic analysis and then

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,459
at the end sorry again there's a manual

72
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,739
code reversing and what separates these

73
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,260
four analysis stages is

74
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,959
that fully automated is

75
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,819
the fastest the easiest the most service

76
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,200
level

77
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,620
and requires the least work from

78
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,239
an analyst

79
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,700
one second

80
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,120
oh here we go all right cool so one

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
second

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,660
yeah we got you great all right thank

83
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,180
you perfect so um

84
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,340
yeah like I said so

85
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,979
at the top level at a very high level um

86
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,840
the fully automated analysis whether it

87
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,720
includes static Dynamic analysis or both

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,540
is very easy to do

89
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,520
um in fact like you can simply take

90
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,720
hey you malware ID dump it into assault

91
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,160
into um

92
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,320
let's see some software like any dot run

93
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,880
and get an automated report generated

94
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,100
um and then after the automated oops

95
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,919
after the automated analysis

96
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,979
each stage after that increases in time

97
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,400
and complexity in the skill required and

98
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,860
um the amount of work

99
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,539
and so we'll be getting into those other

100
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,660
three into the 4-4 right now

101
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,600
so fully automated like I mentioned

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,160
fastest and easiest

103
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,620
um very service level but the purpose is

104
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,120
it can provide a good overview from

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,380
which analysts can start their

106
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,680
investigation and it's very useful in

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,539
handling large amounts of malware and

108
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:22,560
for quick

109
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
triage and you know deciding and for

110
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,680
those who don't know what triaging is

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,020
it's deciding whether or not like how

112
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,639
much of a threat something is and

113
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,100
whether it even deserves

114
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,080
whether it even deserves a deeper

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,419
analysis or

116
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,320
not so an example of that tool is any

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,380
dot run and uh virus total both of them

118
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,620
are web-based are basically websites you

119
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,400
can go to them like with a suspicious um

120
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,699
ID or hash copy and paste it into the

121
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,460
tool and once it's run it will it can

122
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,539
automate

123
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,060
both static and dynamic analysis give

124
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,220
you a simple report

125
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,900
but it does not allow for as much

126
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,020
control or as much detail as the

127
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,620
following stages

128
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,600
next up we have manual static analysis

129
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,060
it's called Static because the file is

130
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,880
examined without running

131
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,139
um

132
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,620
an example of a stack analysis tool is

133
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,680
ghidra an open source tool developed by

134
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,319
the National Security Agency and it is a

135
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,740
disassembler a disassembler is

136
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,720
essentially takes

137
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,919
um

138
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,900
let's see

139
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,720
they take some binary code and I believe

140
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,240
it returns it to assembly

141
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,000
and what this does is

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,039
it provides information for the analyst

143
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,000
to decide what to focus on or if again

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
to focus on it at all and versus just

145
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,380
moving on to something else examples of

146
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,660
static analysis findings are

147
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,199
hashes metadata which is data about the

148
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,360
data like you know the date that the

149
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,759
file was created or

150
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,500
um the data was modified things like

151
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,099
that and also any embedded resources

152
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,880
compared to

153
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,479
um

154
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,580
the automated analysis it doesn't take

155
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,620
that much more time and doesn't take

156
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,039
that much more work in general but then

157
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,380
next up you have

158
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,440
a manual Dynamic analysis so it's called

159
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,960
dynamic because War isn't static you

160
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,520
don't you simply examine the file

161
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,280
without running but Dynamic is where all

162
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,020
that changes that's where the malware

163
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,180
was actually ran and examined however

164
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,560
because

165
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,819
malware can cause serious damage to both

166
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,940
a both the developers or the

167
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,139
Distributors

168
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,280
um system

169
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,319
but also researcher system at the same

170
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,599
time a safe environment is required on

171
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,940
both fronts so this is usually done

172
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,819
using virtual machines like personal box

173
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,000
or VMware or some other kind of sandbox

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,039
environment

175
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:02,879
um

176
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,340
Dynamic analysis requires more skill

177
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,919
time and control but it also allows for

178
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,440
greater details about the malware to be

179
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,840
discovered and um

180
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,319
tools used here are

181
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,759
x64 dbg or X32 dvg both of them are uh

182
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,400
different types of debuggers so the mail

183
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,520
will be ran and the same way for any

184
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,379
developers out there um the same way you

185
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,280
would

186
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
um you have a bug in a

187
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,760
software program you just like step

188
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,080
through that it's pretty much the same

189
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,979
thing

190
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,059
here

191
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,958
um

192
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,779
and examples of dynamic analysis

193
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,039
findings are processes Network traffic

194
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,660
and um

195
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,360
how the malware interactions with its

196
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,279
environment otherwise known as Behavior

197
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,800
Analysis and another cool thing that can

198
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,839
be done with Dynamic analysis that

199
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,779
cannot be done with static is

200
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,220
the

201
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,800
a creative and malware analysts can

202
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,080
imitate

203
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,519
um different parts of the environment

204
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,000
that I will reach out to like an email

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,180
server for example and then simply see

206
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,640
um what the malware can do in regards to

207
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,100
that so

208
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,320
then at the far end

209
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,300
um you have manual code reversing this

210
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,860
is the most time consuming and skill

211
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,200
intensive process and because of this

212
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,720
many investigations

213
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,640
um will not proceed with this step

214
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,880
the tools used are both disassemblers

215
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,100
and debuggers and decompilers and other

216
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,019
plugins and tools like the ones I

217
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,339
mentioned earlier all at the same time

218
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,480
um

219
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,540
Ida Pro is a well-known option and at

220
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,480
this stage memory analysis can help as

221
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,339
well

222
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,899
um

223
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,660
manual code reversing findings include

224
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,339
encrypted data

225
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,640
domain generation algorithm logic and

226
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,519
hidden capabilities that did not show up

227
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,240
in other stages

228
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,939
foreign

229
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,680
so a brief history of agent Tesla

230
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,740
um first showing up in 2014 agent Tesla

231
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,560
start off by being sold on a Turkish

232
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,880
WordPress site

233
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,940
however it would take I'd say what two

234
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,700
or three years before it really started

235
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,399
appearing on everybody's radar before

236
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,320
um a lot of reports of it started being

237
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,160
generated by different um companies and

238
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,940
um

239
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,519
the threat group that currently

240
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,200
distributes and modifies it seems to be

241
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,899
based in Nigeria and is referred to as

242
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,060
Swede by Cisco or silver

243
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,700
carrier by miter

244
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,279
and although Asian Tesla has faded in

245
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,560
and out of popularity over the years its

246
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,779
ease of use dedicated support and

247
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,360
constant Evolution has given its staying

248
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,940
power in various fishing campaigns in

249
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,720
fact

250
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,820
one of the common ways of obtaining it

251
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,140
is

252
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,260
through a dedicated website called agent

253
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,540
tesla.com where there's different

254
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,940
payment plans listed the same way you

255
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,100
would like pay for any other software in

256
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,320
each level can get you like a different

257
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,760
level of

258
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,360
support and set up updates

259
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,019
um

260
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,420
and so on and um all of that for an

261
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,120
extended period of time depending on

262
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,640
what someone is willing to pay and

263
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
because they make it so easy that's why

264
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,519
it's been around for so long so

265
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,519
let's see body and characteristics

266
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,300
um

267
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,279
miter's ID for it is s oops is s0331

268
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,339
it's classified as a rat which stands

269
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,839
for remote access Trojan we'll get into

270
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,300
that in the next slide

271
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,959
um

272
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,660
some characteristics that haven't

273
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,060
changed over the years are that it's

274
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,440
written.net

275
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
it mostly works as a key logger they can

276
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,940
do other things too

277
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,380
it can fill processes so for example

278
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,160
um

279
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,740
any process that say an analyst is

280
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,260
running that might be able to

281
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,620
um analyze it it can detect those and

282
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,320
possibly kill them so

283
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
basically it gets in the way of an

284
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
analyst trying to analyze it

285
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,060
um let's see its factors are that it's

286
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,980
delivered mostly through spam emails

287
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,200
either from

288
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,940
legitimate but compromised email

289
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,639
addresses or malicious email addresses

290
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,639
that look normal at first glance

291
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,980
um it communicates through meaning it

292
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,959
sends once it gets its data

293
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,060
from the victim computer

294
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,240
it sends that data back to

295
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,839
in to like a mail server through SMTP

296
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,420
the most most the time but it can also

297
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,800
use FTP HTTP and recently as in like

298
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,300
within the last few months it's also

299
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,180
been seen sending data to private

300
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,260
telegram chat rooms

301
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,399
now let's talk about what a remote

302
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,260
access Trojan is

303
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,180
or a rat for short

304
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,880
it allows attackers to control computers

305
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,620
similar to what would be allowed by

306
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,839
System administrators

307
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,000
but without the um without like some of

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
the restrictions that even system

309
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,440
administrators would have

310
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,720
um a sophisticated attacker may use

311
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,180
remote access Trojan to scope out the

312
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,220
environment for a long time before

313
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,920
making any moves and this would not only

314
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,480
allow them to

315
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,639
gain more knowledge about the

316
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,800
environment but also avoid detection for

317
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,240
a long period of time

318
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,500
so

319
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,480
Asian Tesla Beyond just being an

320
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,279
information stealer can also create a

321
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,800
jumping point for an attacker to infect

322
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,440
more emails and steal more credentials

323
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,760
which is why I mentioned the previous

324
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,560
slide that

325
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,620
um these spam emails can come from

326
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,579
legitimate but compromised email

327
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,860
addresses which makes it a lot harder to

328
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,279
deal with

329
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,459
all right so we got an automated

330
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,399
analysis with any dot run

331
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,120
um

332
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,699
as you can see here there's

333
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,880
one second so

334
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,600
uh you have let's see one dropper I

335
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,519
guess one dropper file here you have

336
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,740
another dropper file right here

337
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,079
and then finally you have agent Tesla

338
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,540
right over here so

339
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,339
I'll be discussing more about dropper

340
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,300
files in another slide but it's just a

341
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,980
general preview of what it looks like it

342
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,860
seems like agent Tesla no matter what um

343
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,500
year I look at

344
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,180
um from the reports it seems like it

345
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,279
always seems to follow the same format

346
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,240
of

347
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,579
two dropper files followed by the

348
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,079
payload itself

349
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,240
so

350
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,940
static analysis um agent system will

351
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,160
start off by identifying the computer

352
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
name the user's name

353
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,199
IP information internet connectivity

354
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,899
processor name and information

355
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,260
memory and operating system

356
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,720
and it'll start setting those over for

357
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,040
use by the threat actor

358
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
um I mentioned earlier that um Asian

359
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,600
Tesla is a keystroke logger so that's

360
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,639
one things they can do but it can also

361
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,220
gather screenshots it can steal

362
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,899
credentials for example the ones that

363
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,959
are saved in think um

364
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,699
autofill

365
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,560
autofill information that some people

366
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,620
store in uh browsers

367
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,019
um it can still browser cookies and can

368
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,560
also check if another you know piece of

369
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,480
like Asian Tesla malware has already

370
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,420
infected the same host computer and shut

371
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,579
it down if it has

372
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,320
and um

373
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,420
finally after it's collected all this

374
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,800
data that I mentioned

375
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,579
it can in some cases uninstall itself

376
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,560
in order to cover its tracks and make it

377
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,759
look like it was never there in the

378
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,060
first place

379
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,620
so Dynamic behavioral analysis like I

380
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,540
said it usually contains two dropper or

381
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,759
executable files before the actual

382
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,459
payload agent Tesla file starts up

383
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,740
the purpose of a dropper file is to

384
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,660
evade surface level detections and look

385
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,779
as harmless as possible

386
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,480
and also dropper files can

387
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,880
get in the way of analysis efforts and

388
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,720
slow things down

389
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,800
some more stuff so agent Tesla will

390
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,720
check if it's running on a virtual

391
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,820
machine so like those sandbox Solutions

392
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,339
I mentioned earlier which and which um

393
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,380
analysts will use to study agent Tesla

394
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,500
it'll detect first if it is running on a

395
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,699
virtual machine

396
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,420
and if it detects I believe

397
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,639
I believe it's like if it doesn't detect

398
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,220
user input it'll shut itself down after

399
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,339
a certain period of time without running

400
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,600
um

401
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,740
in one case it injects code into Reg

402
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,140
assembly like dot exe to collect Target

403
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,020
info like the name of the computer and

404
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,939
credentials

405
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,919
and it also checks for network

406
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,900
connectivity once data is collected and

407
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,559
use SMTP in most cases to send stolen

408
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,000
data to a remote mail server

409
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,360
foreign

410
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,559
domains are pretty I think out of all

411
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,360
three indicators of compromise the ones

412
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,820
that are most useful are the hashes

413
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,020
because

414
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,520
like I mentioned earlier you can take

415
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,200
you can simply copy and paste one of

416
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,720
these hashes put them into any.run or

417
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,840
virus total and check and see if anyone

418
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,820
else has uploaded the same thing whether

419
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,720
it's malicious or not what um

420
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,100
anti-virus Solutions will

421
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,160
detect it or not and go from there as

422
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,480
well as look at similar hashes

423
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,580
so um defense against Asian Tesla

424
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,840
um

425
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,299
it's pretty simple use a well-known

426
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,880
well-supported antivirus as I saw in

427
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,860
virustotal debt not all antivirus

428
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,200
Solutions will detect the same malware

429
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,059
sample not all of them

430
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,980
have um

431
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,440
have I guess encountered it or have you

432
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,960
know checked for it also make sure you

433
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
keep it updated

434
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,380
watch out for strange emails and

435
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,200
seemingly innocuous attachments so one

436
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
example of you know a seemingly

437
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,120
innocuous attachment are um

438
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,080
let's see an Excel file but you'll have

439
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,880
at the end of the Excel file attachment

440
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,799
it will have another

441
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,200
file name after that but most people

442
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,940
will just look at the Excel file

443
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,919
attachment and think like okay it's

444
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,919
legit and then start downloading it

445
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,260
and uh when in doubt

446
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,059
don't click the attachment or link to

447
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,400
another website simply set it aside and

448
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,539
have somebody else look at it

449
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,820
so common targets are

450
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,059
there's a wide variety of turrets but

451
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,260
um let's see

452
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,419
I believe there's a Spam there's um

453
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,600
fishing campaigns throughout armor

454
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,299
late 2020 that focused on energy and

455
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,600
manufacturing companies mostly

456
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,440
um

457
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,000
some fishing campaigns that have used

458
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,480
Asian Tesla have taken advantage of high

459
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,039
profile events around a lot of people's

460
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,860
minds like kova 19 and the Ukraine

461
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,820
conflict

462
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,299
so one way of fishing campaign using

463
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,480
agent Tesla alert victims was by sending

464
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,620
an email

465
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,179
regarding

466
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,860
through crane Russia's supply chain

467
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,700
conflicts with a executable file titled

468
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,220
req supplier survey and that would of

469
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,360
course get a lot of people's attention

470
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
because they're worried about you know

471
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,659
supply shortages or and so on and in the

472
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,820
early stages the pandemic there was a

473
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,679
campaign a fishing campaign that

474
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,440
advertised base fast supplies with a

475
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,320
malicious PDF attached so

476
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
current state so as of um

477
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,520
April

478
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,740
it is currently ranked number three in

479
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,200
top malware families by checkpoint

480
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
security and it affects two percent of

481
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,159
global organizations

482
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,980
and some of the reasons for

483
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,799
Resurgence are like I said in the first

484
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,140
slide ease of use friendly support in

485
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,880
setting things up

486
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,039
um increased options for communicating

487
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,280
all that to the SEC to success of this

488
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,919
malware telegram is sending data back to

489
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,799
a private telegram chat room is actually

490
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,299
the latest

491
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,020
um

492
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,240
like communication option

493
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,820
for this malware the new version is

494
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,280
harder to statically analyze and no

495
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,659
longer uses

496
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:04,799
um

497
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,360
AES for encryption it uses um

498
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,820
I believe it's pronounced zore to

499
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,679
obfuscate and make it harder to like

500
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,960
statically analyze

501
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,580
um they can extract data from more

502
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,840
Targets in the latest version and buy

503
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,120
more targets I mean

504
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,720
um more browsers for the most part

505
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,980
um the fact that it's been successful

506
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,900
for years as to its credibility like I

507
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,179
said this thing has been it's existence

508
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,140
since 2014 but it's been it's been

509
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,380
popular it's been useful since like 2015

510
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,960
2016 and 2017 and it's just stayed

511
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,679
around

512
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,080
continuing to be modified

513
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,240
um in small ways to make sure that it's

514
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,460
successful in a wide variety of

515
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,000
scenarios

516
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,400
all right so acknowledgments

517
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,080
um I'd like to thank Grimm for allowing

518
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,179
me to present I'd like to thank my

519
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,179
mentor uh Miss Whitlow for giving me

520
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,980
guidance and resources that I never

521
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,840
would have found otherwise

522
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,700
I like my fat I'd like to thank my

523
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,380

541
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,380
Joe you got anything uh while I look in

542
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,419
the other place we've got two questions

543
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:49,799
after you're done with those two I've

544
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,260
got one go ahead and if anyone else has

545
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,320
any other questions please uh write them

546
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,960
down in the chat uh we're monitoring and

547
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,600
we can ask them on your behalf

548
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,820
um so uh did you want me to ask the two

549
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,780
that have already been asked

550
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,580
um yeah sure I'm not seeing them so go

551
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,940
ahead okay cool no problem all right uh

552
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,700
so we'll Sid make the slide deck

553
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,980
available for us to download if so where

554
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,020
can we download it

555
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,940
um if you're on Discord already uh you

556
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,320
can probably post the link in the

557
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,780
Discord if you if you don't mind

558
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,240
otherwise uh if you have a location for

559
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,679
the sides or if you're planning on

560
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:29,820
sharing those

561
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,559
yeah I absolutely plan on sharing these

562
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,020
so um I can uh should I just like copy

563
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,760
should I just like um copy and paste to

564
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,500
like

565
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,179
um get into like the Discord chat or is

566
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,500
there a certain area I have to like uh

567
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,740
cop like um attach it to or

568
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,779
I mean Discord chat seems as good as any

569
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:48,000
place I think you could just uh copy

570
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,039
paste it unless it's got videos or

571
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,360
anything that makes it too big for

572
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,980
Discord

573
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,799
nope none uh let us know if you have any

574
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,659
problems we'll find a place to host it

575
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:58,980
for you

576
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,340
okay all right cool and then uh second

577
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,140
question any tips and tricks to

578
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,659
de-obfuscate heavily obfuscated code or

579
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,460
scripts during static analysis

580
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,980
any tips to de-obpluscate

581
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm gonna be honest like I didn't I

582
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,919
don't know the answer to that question I

583
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,980
didn't dive too much into

584
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,720
um how to de-obiscate

585
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,679
um

586
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,539
I have the obfuscate files in general at

587
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,480
any step of the process so

588
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,240
um sorry about that ah no problem I mean

589
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,059
it's it's a pretty common thing that you

590
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,799
have to balance as an analyst like how

591
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,900
much do you want to dive into actually

592
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,299
the obfuscating the code versus how much

593
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,520
do would you much rather pull from doing

594
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,740
Dynamic analysis

595
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,960
um because

596
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,220
there's also the balance of when you're

597
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,320
an author of malware as well is you

598
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,940
don't want obfuscate too much because

599
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,580
that's a signature like it is very much

600
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,980
a signature that can be detected even on

601
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,620
even on the wire so it's not something

602
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,260
you want to rely on too much

603
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,360
um and then you have the extreme end of

604
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,279
it where it's like VM protect where

605
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,380
everything is just in this encrypted VM

606
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,120
that all the sys calls are the only

607
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,279
thing you'll ever see and it's like well

608
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,960
again like that is something that's

609
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,940
pretty easy to pick up on and it's

610
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,799
pretty noisy

611
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,640
um as far as uh

612
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,860
anti-virus signatures go

613
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,659
um right and um I just wanted to add in

614
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,220
real quick like um I was reading on a

615
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,340
blog post that um even like

616
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,240
um

617
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,980
I'm not sure like if how much this was

618
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,380
back from the obfuscation but even like

619
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,559
a larger file size can you know alert

620
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,480
um malware analysts that like okay like

621
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,919
some things

622
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:41,940
um they're like something's kind of

623
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,000
fishy here and you know lead them to

624
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,400
um examine the file a little more deeply

625
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,760
so I mean there's that too also super

626
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,360
small files are pretty big red flag as

627
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,400
well uh I've definitely had someone tell

628
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,900
me this is how we caught it we just

629
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,020
sorted by size and I just laughed so all

630
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,980
you can do

631
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,039
all right and the the one question I had

632
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,360
was I I don't know if you've played

633
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,159
around with instrumentation it's not

634
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,100
necessarily A malware versus Engineers

635
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,360
required toolkit but I use it a lot in

636
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,640
doing vulnerability analysis and back

637
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,860
when I spent some time in a malware shop

638
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,900
uh where you're essentially just trying

639
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,600
to exercise the binary wall it's in a

640
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,460
sandbox or in your Dynamic analysis

641
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,760
environment uh trying to hit as much of

642
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,580
the functionality as possible and some

643
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,620
of it can be automated but like I felt

644
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,779
like most of the time I spent massaging

645
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,520
it just to try to get it going I was

646
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,900
curious if you have any experience with

647
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,700
instrumentation

648
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,220
so um when he's like you're just talking

649
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,299
about um

650
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,640
just pools in general Beyond like you

651
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,520
know any dot run and buyers total right

652
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
right so um

653
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,620
I don't I mean early on like um like two

654
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,120
weeks ago

655
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,140
um I did try setting up a um was it

656
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,779
I tried going through a malware unicorns

657
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:01,620
um

658
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,500
reverse engineering uh like lab setup

659
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,720
and ah yeah well the resources were out

660
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
of date so I couldn't get the lab set up

661
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,140
so what I ended up doing for this whole

662
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,299
presentation was

663
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,200
um just reading blog posts and uh

664
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,820
like reading blog posts that like

665
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,260
reading blog posts and write-ups that

666
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,360
other people had done in order to figure

667
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,799
out

668
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,740
um what agent Tesla did so I don't have

669
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,840
any I have virtual box on my computer

670
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,240
but I don't have an environment set up

671
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,640
yet and um

672
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,520
I think like I don't know I

673
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,320
I want to be a bit careful when I'm

674
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,480
setting up the environment because just

675
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,880
like a few weeks ago

676
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,740
um I believe some an attacker actually

677
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,200
compromised their own system with agent

678
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,080
Tesla on by you know I'm not sure how

679
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,760
but it just goes to show what can happen

680
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,440
if

681
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,360
um you're not careful with environment

682
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,740
setup so

683
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,120
that's something I want to take some

684
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,460
more time on

685
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,340
yeah there's some uh interesting VMS

686
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,720
published

687
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,120
um I think mandian has one that's pretty

688
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,860
popular I forgot it's called flare or

689
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,799
flame uh yeah I think it's a flare VM

690
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,020
and then I've also heard of uh remnucks

691
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,340
as well so

692
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,539
nice

693
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,640
yeah those those often includes will

694
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,260
include a lot of the tools you'll need

695
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,539
which is really nice because trying to

696
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,720
set up your own image uh like sometimes

697
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,039
you'll you'll just get the sandbox

698
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,220
running and just the way you want it

699
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,320
um but then trying to collaborate uh can

700
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,059
be pretty difficult if you don't have a

701
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,340
standardized set of tools

702
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,880
um

703
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,220
but I I believe some of those do include

704
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,440
something like instrumentation so that's

705
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,419
definitely worth checking out

706
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,580
all right does anyone else have any more

707
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,080
questions

708
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,179
um happy to ask on your behalf otherwise

709
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,159
we can play a video

710
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,860
uh until

711
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,580
1400 which so we've got about 20 minutes

712
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,700
yeah we'll be back with a talk on uh

713
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,620
teaching big companies about security so

714
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,760
looking forward to that one

715
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,720
