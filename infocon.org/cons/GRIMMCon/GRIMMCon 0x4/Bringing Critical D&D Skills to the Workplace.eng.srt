1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,560
that's

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,040
awesome i love the led is that led that

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,320
like they're the light scheme

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
all year round or is it only for today

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,880
it i have two sets of leds now and they

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,440
can

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,199
each be different and because the

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,119
karaoke setup is here

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,279
the green that you see can be light

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,480
reactive

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,720
on a number of different settings that's

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,680
pretty cool

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,039
i'm impressed i mean

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,000
that is a that is a baller setup my

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,200
house is like it's like

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,680
animal crossing wall coverings it is not

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,440
the same as your

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,920
very impressive lions fighting in the

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,680
background

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
so yeah someone asked me about the

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,399
tapestry and it was just cool i used to

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:48,960
have a big

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
office so i bought it for one of the

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,600
walls but i like it

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
so it would be my tapestry if i had to

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,039
choose one

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
are we are we correcting that you're yet

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,320
another sig

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,080
inter or former sig enter yeah i

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,320
someone else was a former singer and he

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
claimed to be a former marine but i've

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
heard there's no such thing as a former

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
marine

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
that is what it said in the bio so we're

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,560
just gonna have to believe what he sent

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,600
in

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,119
and i feel like we're like the

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,439
association of old crows has decided to

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,799
descend upon us

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,640
i mean that's some you know dc

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,439
cider stuff going on here that's deep

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:29,840
now

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
that's deep so uh

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
what better what better people to

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,759
understand

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,799
you know the intelligence process in dod

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,680
though

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,159
right i mean like it's natural natural

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,000
fit to help in cyber security from that

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
field

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
i i think you know one of the things

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,119
that

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,720
they've always told me is that like

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
human lies and sigint never does

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,920
because people don't lie to themselves

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,680
but they will definitely lie

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
to you human lies but singing never does

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,159
no second is the ground truth that's how

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,520
it works sigin

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,878
is comprised of data but you have to

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,720
understand like when we were talking

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,120
about

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,239
intercepting like you know cell phones

64
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,520
as an example

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,640
um people are gonna lie on the phone

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,560
is it my phone is it his phone whose

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,319
phone is it who owns the phone how long

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,440
have they had the phone

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,920
it's not as simple not as simple

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
and deriving intelligence from that data

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,440
is another

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
is another question together which i

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,760
actually think one of our former

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,280
speakers addressed

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
yeah uh one of them tying it back to a

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,120
previous talk

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,239
i love it yeah if you have intelligence

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
without analysis it is just data

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,720
there it has to be analyzed so far by

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
humans i don't think we will be

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,200
having ai robots replace humans for

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,720
terms of intelligence analysis

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,360
i will say there has been some advances

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
in terms of

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
um fine when you get a mass amount of

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,440
data being able to do

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,720
like subject matter analysis and

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,640
so like if i want to separate all the um

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
russian bots who are spewing a very

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,200
particular trend of thought

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,400
even though they're using different

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,480
phrases and words you often can do

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,519
a lot of work with that but i think

94
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,480
i think oftentimes the application of ml

95
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:30,799
is

96
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
uh is something to ameliorate

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,440
the the challenge and to aid the humans

98
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,959
not to remove the humans from the loop

99
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,640
entirely

100
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,840
and i think the focus on on aiding

101
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
humans in the loop uh categorizing the

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,519
data faster

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,000
helping us analyze the data faster in

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,040
any

105
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,439
in any intelligence whether it's sigint

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,799
or human or cyber threat intelligence

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,879
is going to be vital because there's far

108
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,760
too much data for any person to look at

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
right so can we automatically categorize

110
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,159
events that are attacking my

111
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,239
infrastructure against the miter attack

112
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,760
framework with like 90

113
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,640
success like that would be fantastic and

114
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,360
then

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,399
you know categorize the level of concern

116
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,959
or risk of those events so i can look at

117
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,798
what i need to look at because i'm never

118
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,840
going to look at everything

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,639
i think that's exactly right we should

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,080
do your intro

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
and we have not done your intro we've

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,360
just decided

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
go ahead oh bryson yeah no i want to do

124
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,280
a public service announcement

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
um so uh for those of you who are

126
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
concerned about the schedule it's like

127
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,360
all conferences right there's more than

128
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,919
one track there is no way to take it all

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,040
in take a break drink some water

130
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
step away these in-betweens are just us

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,120
doing banter you're not gonna miss

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,600
anything

133
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
take a break uh everything is recorded

134
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,440
it'll be there for you later

135
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
right okay so do not hurt yourself

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
trying to catch

137
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
catch everything uh we love that you're

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,840
there that you're that excited that

139
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,199
there's this much awesome

140
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,199
from all the volunteers and the speakers

141
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,240
and the coaches that have made this

142
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,039
possible

143
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,400
um and of course my my guest mcs uh

144
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,479
but you know do it at your own pace okay

145
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,080
and now we'll introduce john

146
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,160
very well at least i don't know if i'm

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
the the best suited for it because i

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,479
have never played dungeons and dragons i

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:26,880
am

150
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,360
sorry to say it's been on my to-do list

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,600
but i was going to form my group

152
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
and then the pandemic happens and so

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,039
wait i have not yet done it

154
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,520
can i ask john a quick question first

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,320
yeah go ahead

156
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
okay when when if you grew up playing

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
dungeons dragons for 30 years

158
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
right and that means that your internal

159
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,440
understanding of people

160
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,840
has an alignment chart as its basis i

161
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,479
assume

162
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
so which alignment are you

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,479
i'm chaotic good okay because i assume

164
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,360
that everyone

165
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
in our industry will say they are

166
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
chaotic good if other people were

167
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,160
talking about you

168
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,120
what would they say you were category

169
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,400
neutral

170
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,639
is the alignment chart from dungeons and

171
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,039
dragons that chaotic good

172
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,039
yes i spent several hours trying to

173
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,000
explain to my

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,319
nephew who was about eight at the time

175
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,039
how

176
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,120
morality worked and why we couldn't just

177
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,400
kill all the villagers

178
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,880
in explanation of the alignment chart um

179
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,319
so he may grow up to be

180
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,600
a very smart uh very scary person but

181
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
you know hopefully hopefully he'll learn

182
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,680
but uh i was like no that that's evil

183
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,199
that's evil can't just kill all the

184
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,479
villagers

185
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,319
i think my favorite alignment chart i

186
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,759
will be honest is the doug

187
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,560
song alignment chart where he labeled

188
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
different companies

189
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,560
and personas in the information security

190
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,520
space

191
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,759
and of course he put immunity as neutral

192
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,720
evil

193
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
which i feel is an accurate reflection

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,319
you need to drop that in the discord

195
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,440
because i haven't seen that i want to

196
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,479
check that out

197
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,759
i will drop it in the discord but i'm

198
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,199
excited for your talk because i've

199
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,919
actually gotten a

200
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,680
huge amount of value from my dungeons

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,360
and dragons experience

202
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,599
expect doing military war games of all

203
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,880
the weirdest things

204
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,280
because they are the same thing and so

205
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,639
i'm really excited about this

206
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,039
and um i guess without further ado we

207
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,919
should let you

208
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,919
do it well he's got he's got two more

209
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,759
minutes before we start so we're gonna

210
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,199
keep taking a break right now

211
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,919
um this is a light-hearted career

212
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,199
focused talk

213
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,560
i i that will discuss non-hard cyber

214
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,080
skills and why they're important cyber

215
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,880
security

216
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,680
as a three plus year player and dungeon

217
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
master with dungeons and dragons

218
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,240
uh he thought this talk might lure in

219
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,199
some folks to discuss soft skills

220
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,879
he he thought it might also help

221
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,479
overcome imposter syndrome

222
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,160
because for a lot of roles you need to

223
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
be well-rounded dnd

224
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,639
taught him how to think on his feet

225
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,280
resolve

226
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,520
conflicts with people you consider your

227
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,840
friends

228
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,759
and as a as a dungeon master i

229
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
he he game planned what-if scenarios

230
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,840
quickly

231
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,520
and learned how to tell stories which

232
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
are critical to lots of roles

233
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
i apologize for slightly butchering that

234
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,280
and also i have to say

235
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,160
me not knowing that those uh charts had

236
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,039
something to do with dungeons and

237
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,039
dragons will now forever be recorded

238
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,160
um so i'll just have to live with that

239
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,759
but i'm very excited for this talk

240
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,360
and for those of you who do like playing

241
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
dungeons and dragons my virtual happy

242
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,320
hour will be

243
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
a choose your own adventure as we go

244
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,599
through an incident response

245
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,479
you don't want to miss that i will try

246
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,000
to be there but you do not want to miss

247
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,279
that

248
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,959
alright so am i sharing my screen

249
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,959
i see it it's beautiful all right

250
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,600
so thanks to the grimcon volunteers and

251
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,519
bryson for letting me speak here today

252
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,240
um i think this is the third grim con

253
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,160
i've been involved with in some capacity

254
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,279
and they've all been

255
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,720
super excellent so i am in discord i

256
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,160
obviously probably can't keep an eye on

257
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,480
that

258
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
while i'm giving the presentation but

259
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,240
i'll be available for questions there

260
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,959
afterwards and as long as i feel good

261
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
later i will try to join the choose your

262
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,080
own adventure

263
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,120
and i won't give anything away so

264
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,399
just a little bit about me i'm not going

265
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,160
to spend too much on this but i am

266
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,200
apparently the second former second uh

267
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,920
personnel

268
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,440
who presented today so that's very

269
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,519
interesting um sig into signals

270
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,560
intelligence

271
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,480
um if you have questions about that i

272
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,399
will tell you what i can about that

273
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,600
uh offline you can dm me um

274
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,519
i have a whole bunch of certifications

275
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
which was being discussed in the chat

276
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,800
i have a whole bunch of certifications

277
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
because they help me advance my career

278
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
um we can discuss whether or not any or

279
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
all of them

280
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
are actually helpful for any or all of

281
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
the work i've done in this field

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
i've been in cyber security for about 11

283
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,000
years with 21 total in light intel and

284
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
dod

285
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
most of my experience since i got out of

286
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
2010 has been focused on the dod

287
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
and mostly in and around the fort meade

288
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,760
maryland region

289
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120
i'm also huge into soccer huge in soccer

290
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,440
and

291
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,640
obviously role-playing games and

292
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,560
dungeons and dragons so

293
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,320
if you have just joined this talk and

294
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
you have no idea what dungeon dragons

295
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,839
is i'm going to give like a quick maybe

296
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,880
two minute overview so this is a fantasy

297
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,959
often described as tabletop role-playing

298
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
game plenty of dungeon and dragon games

299
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
have gone virtual especially during the

300
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
pandemic or can be done virtually

301
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
i prefer the in person as opposed to

302
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
virtual ideally two to eight people

303
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,959
typically your friends um and it's

304
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,480
really funny because pretty much the

305
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
nerdiest game on earth that requires you

306
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
to have a group of friends to play

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,399
whether online or in person right

308
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,120
i am the liverpool fan also so i'll try

309
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,880
to keep an eye on discord and boy our

310
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
season

311
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,120
um so books dice miniatures which are

312
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
little tiny figures we used

313
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
to represent things that are happening

314
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
on sort of like a battlefield

315
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,800
when you encounter monsters you'll hear

316
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,959
the term dungeon master or game master

317
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,320
quite regularly so

318
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,760
a lot of a lot of rpg say game master

319
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,720
now because it has

320
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
you know not any weird connotations with

321
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,279
it so that's sort of the organizer so

322
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,640
that's who's running and building the

323
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,360
session

324
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
who's sort of directing the group of

325
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,079
player characters

326
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,279
through the story and everybody else is

327
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,040
making up the adventuring party so

328
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
everybody makes up some sort of a

329
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
character and they role play as that

330
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
character they're the adventuring party

331
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
the dungeon master or game master then

332
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,839
throws

333
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,279
things and story at them and then that

334
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,959
adventuring party is reacting to what's

335
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,200
going on it's sort of like a play

336
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
where you are given a part except there

337
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,240
are no scripts and you actually don't

338
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,279
know what the play is about

339
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,279
you just show up on stage and then stuff

340
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,920
happens and you have to play

341
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,399
your character if anybody is familiar

342
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,000
with murder mysteries it's very much

343
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,680
like a murder mystery where you're given

344
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
a part to play

345
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,160
we use a lot of dice so you will see

346
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,440
polyhedral dice

347
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
d20s d6s d4s they're the worst to step

348
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,120
on

349
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,440
and i actually have so many dice it's

350
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
not funny

351
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
so you've probably if you've ever gone

352
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,639
to the game store you are familiar with

353
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,839
this it can take a lot of different

354
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,560
forms

355
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,519
um so there are some terrain setups lots

356
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,360
of tabletop rpgs are going to look

357
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
like this in some capacity or they're

358
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,680
gonna look like this in some capacity

359
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,200
you could see the dice you can see all

360
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,959
the miniatures everybody has their

361
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,040
player character sheet in front of them

362
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
and that's a really large group to be

363
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
playing a tabletop game if they are all

364
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,639
actually involved

365
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,320
and dungeons and dragons is pretty much

366
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,480
suited for all ages probably like 10 and

367
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,040
up and then obviously you can cater to

368
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,600
to the needs of the group

369
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,560
so many books so many books are required

370
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,079
for dungeons and dragons right

371
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,120
and that actually leads me in to my

372
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
first uh actual topic about research and

373
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,160
reading comprehension

374
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
i remember when i started playing

375
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,519
dungeons or dragons around the age of

376
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,880
like 12 or 14

377
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
i just came across all these terms and

378
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,240
all these rules

379
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,959
and words and i had to like go look up

380
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,720
and that's pretty much the first time

381
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,000
i've ever encountered the terms

382
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,560
meritocracy oligarchy patriarchy

383
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,440
right it was from reading dungeons and

384
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,560
dragons books

385
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
and frankly dungeons and dragons is the

386
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
reason i became an avid reader

387
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,800
when i was in my pre-teens and early

388
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
teens it was nothing to do with our

389
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,600
english class it was

390
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
all about reading basically any dungeon

391
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
dragon's book or any

392
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
novel based on the two dragons i could

393
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,800
right

394
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,920
so i will say that

395
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,800
the complexity and depth of material

396
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,560
that most people who are involved in

397
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,760
role-playing games

398
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,880
is familiar with and and consumes

399
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,519
regularly is frankly astounding if

400
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,720
you've never been around the

401
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,880
role-playing community before right

402
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,399
i mean people will have hundreds of

403
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,399
books and the books will oftentimes have

404
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,920
hundreds of pages

405
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,240
and we'll re-read things and some of its

406
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
rules and some of it's just

407
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,240
stories and there's a lot of fantasy

408
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,959
novels

409
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,079
built in and around all of these worlds

410
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,160
that exist in fantasy role-playing as

411
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,800
well

412
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
and then you have someone else i think

413
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,320
on the on the

414
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,839
on the other track on track two was

415
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,360
talking about his love of harry potter

416
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,199
and lords of the rings and that all

417
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,839
gets uh you know involved into this as

418
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,560
well

419
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,600
so i say that this is one of the first

420
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,800
items because for those of us in it

421
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
tech cyber security this ability to

422
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
read for actual comprehension

423
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,160
and to do significant research is

424
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,519
required

425
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
for any role right i don't care what it

426
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,639
is that you're doing

427
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,240
we google or bing

428
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,440
so much to answer questions because

429
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,320
we'll never know everything stuff and

430
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,360
information

431
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
is coming out regardless of your

432
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,600
specialization in the cyber threat intel

433
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,240
world

434
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,959
right we're we're constantly inundated

435
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,480
with new information about

436
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,600
adversaries new tactics techniques and

437
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,279
procedures ttps

438
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,600
if you're on the pen test side right

439
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
there's new tools that are coming out

440
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,399
you

441
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,360
so this ability to read large volumes of

442
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,000
data

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
understand what that data is actually

444
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,320
telling you

445
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,360
to be able to skim information

446
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,480
to be able to do effective research on

447
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,800
cyber security and tech topics

448
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
i feel like if those are things that

449
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,639
you're good at and maybe you're good at

450
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:34,880
it

451
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,639
not because you're involved in dungeons

452
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,160
or dragons or an rpg

453
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,600
maybe you're good at it for some other

454
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
reason those skills

455
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,120
carry over to pretty much any role in it

456
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,560
or cyber security

457
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,600
right so that's my first one and again

458
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
some of this is

459
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
especially for my junior folks who might

460
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
watch this now or watch it later

461
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,839
there's a lot of imposter syndrome these

462
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,360
are skills that are critical for our

463
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
industry that you have

464
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
or that you could bring to the table

465
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,120
even into a junior entry-level role

466
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
right so if you're really good at this

467
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,040
then you can always keep in the back of

468
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,680
the mind

469
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,279
what i'm really good at that is actually

470
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,880
applicable to my job

471
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,920
and this is one of those skills

472
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,040
this is a big one communication i'm not

473
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,560
the first person to talk about

474
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,639
communication today

475
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,440
both written and verbal communication so

476
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
written communication in the world

477
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,920
i work in is so critical right there are

478
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
some really excellent examples and there

479
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,639
are some really

480
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,440
poor examples of communication in

481
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,160
multiple

482
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,279
forms whether it's uh you know very

483
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,040
technical communication

484
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,480
some sort of like a nist publication um

485
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,040
whether it's a verbal presentation that

486
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,399
someone is giving

487
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
internal maybe it's feedback about an

488
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,600
incident right there's all sorts

489
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
communication is so critical for this

490
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,320
industry

491
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
and frankly we should do better at

492
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,560
communicating with each other and cross

493
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,519
teams and cross specializations and in

494
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,000
our purple

495
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,319
team engagements right i don't care

496
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,160
where you work in tech or where you work

497
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,439
in cyber security

498
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,240
this communication and how to do it well

499
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,599
is critical

500
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,880
and if you are used to being involved in

501
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,000
role-playing games you know this

502
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,119
is true as well right so you know verbal

503
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,720
communication

504
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
skills around the role playing games is

505
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,319
going to carry over

506
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,200
because you also probably have been

507
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,880
developing some empathy through some of

508
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,160
the role-playing games

509
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,120
not everyone does but hopefully you

510
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,799
learn to be empathetic with the other

511
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,160
players that are playing

512
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,440
you might even learn empathy through

513
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,320
playing a role that you aren't that

514
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
familiar with right so you know you play

515
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,280
a role

516
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
as an elf or a dwarf and there are

517
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,919
certain stereotypes with that

518
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,400
right so you can actually learn empathy

519
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
through role-playing games as well

520
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
i'm gonna come back to that a little

521
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,679
later um

522
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,160
so i think these written and verbal

523
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,799
skills

524
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
are critical the other thing is that

525
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,600
and broadly speaking here a lot of

526
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,400
very technical people very hands-on

527
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,559
keyboard people

528
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,799
really don't enjoy writing the reports

529
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,360
they don't enjoy that aspect of the job

530
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
that's not true for everyone

531
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,360
but in a lot of cases some of those

532
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
people have chosen to do very technical

533
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,080
hands-on

534
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,919
types of things because that's what they

535
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,120
like to do

536
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,360
right so someone needs to write the

537
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
report someone on the red team

538
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,160
needs to write a report that is

539
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,280
excellent

540
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,679
right so who's going to do that i

541
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,200
personally have worked with a number of

542
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,799
people who work in the pen testing field

543
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,679
who have told me

544
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,160
they don't like writing right it's just

545
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,760
not something they're comfortable with

546
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,559
or that they prefer to do right so it's

547
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,120
not an aspect of the job they love

548
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,320
this is so important and some of the

549
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
things you can bring to the table with

550
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
communication written in verbal is that

551
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,720
empathy

552
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,919
and emotional iq which is often

553
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,520
abbreviated eq

554
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,799
when we're communicating right so those

555
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,880
are some skills that you

556
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,760
might have from this hobby that you're

557
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,480
bringing into the workplace

558
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,360
the next topic cooperative problem

559
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,720
solving

560
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
all right yeah someone in chat is says

561
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
don't be a pentester if you can't write

562
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,280
there's uh there's a lot of jobs where

563
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,039
you shouldn't go to the job if you don't

564
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,400
think that writing

565
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
or communicating verbally is going to be

566
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
really critical

567
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,720
um cooperative problem solving um

568
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
we all see this in the role-playing

569
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,720
games right there's a group of players

570
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,840
and the game master is throwing out

571
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,200
some sort of problem encounter that they

572
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
have to deal with right

573
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,400
so there's immediate cooperative problem

574
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
solving and then there's sort of the

575
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,840
in game right the players you know the

576
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,520
elves and the dwarves figuring out what

577
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,080
to do

578
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
and then there's the metagame the out of

579
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,840
game problem solving

580
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,600
that all role-playing groups are going

581
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,360
to have right like

582
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
they will be there will be discussion

583
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
amongst your adventuring party

584
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,280
the actual people you know you know

585
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,400
jenny and billy

586
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,679
and fred as to what best way to solve

587
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,559
the problem

588
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,960
and then there is the in-game problem

589
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,600
solving of what their elven wizard

590
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,760
and dwarven paladin think they should do

591
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,720
with in-game knowledge right so there's

592
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
actually two levels to interesting

593
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,679
cooperative problem solving that exists

594
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,400
in most

595
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,440
role-playing games right so

596
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,640
this cooperative problem solving and

597
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,120
hearing other people's ideas and taking

598
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,520
different ideas into consideration

599
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,039
yeah you're probably going to need that

600
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,799
until you die

601
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,480
right so throughout your whole working

602
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,320
life and i assume into the retirement

603
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,120
community

604
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,600
there is going to be cooperative problem

605
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,640
solving

606
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,559
right at every level whether it's the

607
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,840
most junior person

608
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,480
trying to resolve you know a jira ticket

609
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
in the system

610
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,280
or whether it's a cooperative problem

611
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
solving in the c-suite about where we're

612
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,240
going to spend

613
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,760
you know the remaining two million

614
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
dollars this quarter

615
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,559
it is all cooperative problem-solving

616
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,320
and there are people who are really

617
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,240
good at cooperative problem solving and

618
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,480
there are some people who probably could

619
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,880
use some training on cooperative problem

620
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,919
solving

621
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,320
one thing that i heard recently that

622
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,120
really stuck

623
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,520
with me and i think this kind of goes

624
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,799
into cooperative problem solving a

625
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,240
little bit as well

626
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,039
is influence and having spheres of

627
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,559
influence

628
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,120
and good leaders will create spheres of

629
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,240
influence

630
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,880
and poor leaders will create spheres of

631
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,400
control

632
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,679
you will see this in role-playing groups

633
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,520
some gm's or dms want to control groups

634
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,559
some players want to control

635
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,640
groups and be the dictator and there are

636
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,440
other people that are much better at

637
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
cooperative problem solving

638
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
because there may be more than one way

639
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,200
to do something and the group has to

640
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
agree on what the best way

641
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,440
is and you will find that there are

642
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
people who

643
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,039
are better at understanding different

644
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,799
people's perspectives and taking that

645
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,320
into account and considering

646
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
alternatives and those are all critical

647
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
skills

648
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,600
pretty much anywhere but but since we

649
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,360
are in the infosec industry

650
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,000
that's where i'm concentrating i assume

651
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,039
most people

652
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,360
could improve regardless of industry

653
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,880
about cooperative problem solving

654
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,320
project or program management

655
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,799
if you have ever been in a role-playing

656
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,520
group

657
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,799
you understand that the graphic up there

658
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,120
about organizing your rpg session

659
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,679
is accurate whether it's virtual or in

660
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,039
person

661
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,120
so again this is not a hard technical

662
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,559
skill

663
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,200
however there are some when you're

664
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
really getting to like pmp or project

665
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
plus and some of the more advanced

666
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
project management activities i would

667
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,720
say that there's

668
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,559
quite a bit that you need to understand

669
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,640
and know especially when it comes to

670
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,000
to budgeting and project planning

671
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,559
and you may be familiar with this if

672
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,679
you're in an rpg

673
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,480
group or you've run rpgs as a game

674
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
master

675
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,159
any activity with these multiple people

676
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,520
is difficult to plan

677
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,960
right so these skills are going to

678
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,200
translate into things you do

679
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,720
at work right so what are we going to do

680
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,039
about

681
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
food right let's just take that as an

682
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,039
example like well what if we have people

683
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,080
with special diets what if we have

684
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,600
somebody who has an allergy what if

685
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,279
we have somebody who has that weird like

686
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,279
cilantro thing so if we get mexican they

687
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,480
can't have that because it tastes like

688
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,200
soap to them

689
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,279
whatever that's called right how are we

690
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,880
going to deal with the payment

691
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,200
what about like fred who like hasn't

692
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,279
paid the last two times

693
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,240
well what about that does he not have

694
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,120
the money

695
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,840
like let's actually let's actually use

696
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
you know problem solving skills to try

697
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,000
and tackle

698
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,279
some of these things right what do we

699
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,000
want to do

700
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,840
in the in-game planning so if you're

701
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,360
running the games and it's not a

702
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,400
pre-made game

703
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,760
right you're running your own scenarios

704
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,600
which is what i prefer to do

705
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,080
um you know what's your what's your

706
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,600
story arc

707
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,440
what's the what do the sessions look

708
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,279
like to get me to where the story arc

709
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,559
wants to be

710
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,320
at the right time for the right

711
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,400
progression of the character levels

712
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,720
so that the project can can be delivered

713
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,760
to the client wait now

714
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,679
so that we can get to the right story

715
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,360
arc at the right time for where i want

716
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,240
the players to be at the right level

717
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,960
right a lot of this a lot of this is

718
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,000
going to translate

719
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
into your project or program management

720
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
you just hadn't thought about it that

721
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,480
way yet

722
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,039
right calendars emails invites

723
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,159
coordination

724
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,360
my daughter who is in college has some

725
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,240
of the best

726
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,360
organizational skills i've seen compared

727
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,840
to people that i have had to work with

728
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,200
who are making six figure salaries

729
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
if you if you are someone who's really

730
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,200
comfortable

731
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,960
about making sure when you send an

732
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,480
outlook calendar to invite to go to the

733
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,679
schedule checker to make sure

734
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,360
everybody's free at the time that you

735
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
send the meeting invite

736
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,880
do you have any idea do you have any

737
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,760
idea how helpful that is

738
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,559
right so all of those little things

739
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,080
especially if you're trying to break

740
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
into the field or a junior

741
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
that you think maybe aren't actually

742
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
important work skills

743
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,440
they're important work skills they're

744
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,679
gonna get noticed by the people who

745
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,520
hopefully are mentoring you

746
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,440
as you work on maybe some of the more

747
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
technical skills that you're currently

748
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,320
upskilling

749
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,240
we mentioned communication right

750
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,159
communication is so critical

751
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,760
and so is understanding that these

752
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,840
skills can translate over

753
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,959
into your work setting

754
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,240
creativity and imagination right so

755
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,720
this is really important for cyber

756
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,840
security

757
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,880
because what we're doing

758
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,919
isn't working

759
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,679
you may have noticed this year

760
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,840
a number of high-level breaches i don't

761
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
know maybe you've kind of caught some

762
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,080
things about that

763
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,200
um so the united states continues to

764
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,320
spend

765
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,080
uh uh money that is to me

766
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,600
hard to even imagine incalculable

767
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,039
and we continue to mostly

768
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,440
do the things that we were doing

769
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,799
pre-breach five years ago

770
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,159
for the most part so we are making

771
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,000
strides

772
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,600
but i'd say it's slow going

773
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,480
right so now we're starting to see a lot

774
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,039
about

775
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,000
purple teaming right and it's not just

776
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,200
bringing the red team in the blue team

777
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,320
together because they're just going to

778
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,600
argue and apparently get in some sort of

779
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:55,919
like

780
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,159
jiu jitsu fist fight right there's

781
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,919
actually a lot of skill

782
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,960
in getting that to work

783
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,279
as a purple team it's not just inviting

784
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,960
them to the same conference room or zoom

785
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,840
call

786
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,559
okay have you built up trust are there

787
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,159
good lines of communication

788
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,320
is there cooperative problem solving did

789
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,600
you check to see if they're all

790
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,440
available on the calendar before you

791
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,279
invited them

792
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,120
what's the goal of the meeting did we

793
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,960
send out pre-meeting

794
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,679
notes or are we still sending out

795
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,039
meetings with no

796
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,320
details because please stop doing that

797
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,399
i'm not going to come to the meeting is

798
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,679
there an agenda

799
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,960
can i have an agenda why am i here

800
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,320
i'm a red teamer i'm not a purple teamer

801
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,039
this is the way we've always done it

802
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,520
everyone who is also a veteran has heard

803
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,320
that

804
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,559
answer to the question of why are we

805
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,080
doing this this way

806
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,200
probably more than one time the military

807
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,320
is very slow

808
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,960
to adapt as are most government

809
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,080
organizations

810
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,000
that i have worked with very slow to

811
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,120
adapt

812
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,520
so we have to use our consulting

813
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,000
business knowledge and prowess to

814
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,799
shoehorn

815
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,960
creativity and imagination sometimes to

816
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,840
help them

817
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
it's not always natural for certain

818
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,120
organizations

819
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,240
to embrace change

820
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,279
right so through change

821
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,679
and when we're changing for the better

822
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,120
we can use our creativity and

823
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,559
imagination

824
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,120
in my opinion this is a critical skill

825
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,080
in this industry

826
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,200
that we don't talk about a lot right

827
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,000
so it could be as simple as we need an

828
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,279
analogy

829
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,399
that the users will understand right

830
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,080
because the users don't know what a

831
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,039
fishing email is and we've probably

832
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,480
confused them

833
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,520
by using fishing because bobby

834
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,880
goes fishing and he has no idea that

835
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,760
there's supposed to be an analogy no

836
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,000
one's

837
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,039
ever told him the analogy before

838
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,240
so it's very confusing right

839
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,640
so this creativity and imagination can

840
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,279
help in a multitude of ways

841
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,279
regardless of where you're at in your

842
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,320
specialization in cyber security

843
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,960
oh i inherited this excuse seven years

844
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,919
seven years chuck

845
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,240
this is what they gave me when i started

846
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,960
right

847
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,720
so this is the same incident response

848
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,320
plan we've had for five years we just

849
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,000
update the date

850
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,760
yeah is it only stored on the sharepoint

851
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,440
drive because that's going to be down

852
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,360
if there's a ransomware tag we have this

853
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,200
printed somewhere

854
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,799
right and since i'm mostly in the cyber

855
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,840
threat intel and tell side of this

856
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,520
world the creativity and imagination

857
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,279
helps us think like an adversary

858
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,279
right so for all of the people that

859
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,760
aspire to be pen testers or red teamers

860
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,240
or cyber threat intelligence people

861
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,279
you know what will the adversary do

862
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,240
all right so we can take that at any

863
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,880
level from tactical to strategic

864
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,799
about what the adversary is going to do

865
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,240
there was an excellent twitter thread

866
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,279
yesterday and now i'm going down a

867
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,080
rabbit hole

868
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,720
about a former intelligence person on

869
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,200
twitter

870
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
basically explained why we're never

871
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,240
going to go war with china and i was

872
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
very excited by this

873
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,080
because what here all the time is that

874
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,679
our defense spending is necessary

875
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,120
because we have to be successful in at

876
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,440
least two two large worst

877
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,640
two large simultaneous engagements right

878
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,039
it's a reason we spend like a bajillion

879
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:25,679
bitcoin

880
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,840
on the dod every year right and have 10

881
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
nuclear aircraft carriers

882
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,600
let's actually get people who understand

883
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,720
china holistically to explain to me

884
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,640
why it might be unlikely to go to war

885
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,120
with china where's that discussion

886
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,200
where can i watch that panel discussion

887
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,440
right so that's at the most strategic

888
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,240
level

889
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,520
right i could bring that all the way

890
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,120
down to tactical about like what

891
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
controls are most important

892
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,159
what controls are most important that we

893
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,320
maybe want to focus on as a blue team as

894
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,159
a defender

895
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,279
based on our industry vertical

896
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,720
based on the threats that have

897
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,399
previously and that we think

898
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,720
are most likely to target me but i have

899
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
to understand the adversary i have to

900
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,600
understand

901
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,360
the ransomware operators i have to

902
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,720
understand the north korean apt

903
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,120
and why they're actually pretty

904
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
significantly different

905
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,760
from the iranian apts and

906
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,480
understand that different iranian apts

907
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,120
are different from other iranian apts

908
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,720
but i have to actually understand how

909
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,559
the adversary thinks that requires

910
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,159
creativity and imagination

911
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,200
because i'm a white guy who was born in

912
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,519
america

913
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,880
and i actually grew up in west virginia

914
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,480
so sometimes i could even pretend to

915
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,760
have a west virginia accent

916
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,039
conflict resolution so you think

917
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,279
conflict resolution is difficult to do

918
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,399
at work try conflict

919
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,799
resolution with a group of some of your

920
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,440
best friends around a role-playing game

921
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,600
right so i think there's no better way

922
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,000
to get better at conflict resolution at

923
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,640
work

924
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,360
across whatever the conflict might be

925
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,080
than

926
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,080
to have had repeated conflict resolution

927
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,960
on the role-playing tabletop game with

928
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
your friends

929
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,159
right i mean friendships could be on the

930
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,640
line has anyone else ever had to like

931
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,360
ask someone to not return to the

932
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
role-playing group

933
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,480
boy can that be awkward i think i've

934
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,640
ruined at least one friendship that way

935
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880
so there's some lessons learned there

936
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,399
right so again

937
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,720
empathy we're talking about building

938
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,919
relationships

939
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,720
losing relationships right having

940
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,320
problematic relationships with your

941
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,200
friends maybe

942
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,519
family if you play with your family

943
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,640
right

944
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,360
and the conflicts in dungeon dragons are

945
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,480
in any rpg

946
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,799
right it could be around any number of

947
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,080
different factors

948
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,559
just like conflict resolutions at work

949
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,360
can be around

950
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,720
any number of factors at work one of the

951
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,679
current ones

952
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,760
that you will soon be involved in no

953
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,600
doubt is

954
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
do we allow everyone to continue to

955
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,679
telework all of the time

956
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,399
boy that's going to be interesting and

957
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,000
there are going to be some companies and

958
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,679
organizations that get it right

959
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,440
and they're going to be some that don't

960
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,320
get it right i can guarantee that

961
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,519
and that will come around empathy it's

962
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,559
going to come around

963
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,480
influence which we've talked about a

964
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,000
little bit

965
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,519
i also think a lot of conflict

966
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,519
resolution and some of the concepts that

967
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,360
i've talked about already here and other

968
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,880
speakers have talked about

969
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,279
also goes into social engineering and

970
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,120
yes social engineering is basically a

971
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,000
specialty that you

972
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,039
can have a job in right so

973
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,080
you can be known and

974
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,760
concentrate and upskill social

975
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,000
engineering as part of engagements that

976
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,080
use social engineering

977
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,320
i learned probably two years ago that

978
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,360
there's in

979
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,080
there there's physical pen testing i

980
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,519
didn't know that was the thing

981
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,799
that sounds pretty cool um so

982
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,919
a lot of these uh topics in this

983
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,360
presentation so far

984
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,600
are gonna be critical in the workplace

985
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,760
and again if you're a junior person

986
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,239
and you think that these are some of

987
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,359
your strengths

988
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,918
then lean into your strengths as you

989
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,440
upskill other areas so

990
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,879
i could probably make this presentation

991
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,560
go on for like three hours but i think

992
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,879
i'd probably lose some of you

993
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,879
i really appreciated the keynote this

994
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,000
morning and

995
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,760
this is the first time that i've had

996
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
sort of an end of the day presentation

997
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,879
and i was editing this this powerpoint

998
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,119
as the day went on to make sure i hit

999
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,879
upon some of the same things from

1000
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,918
earlier

1001
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,199
the soft skills aren't optional

1002
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,119
we all know some people who think

1003
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,879
they're optional

1004
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,879
those aren't people i enjoy working with

1005
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,879
or working for

1006
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,520
so if you find people who think soft

1007
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
skills are optional

1008
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,680
they're gonna have a reputation whether

1009
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
it's widely known

1010
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,040
or not they're going to have a

1011
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,640
reputation on their team

1012
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
with their employees their bosses

1013
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,880
probably know who they are

1014
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,800
and someone like that will possibly get

1015
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,520
far in certain aspects of our industry

1016
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,960
if their technical skills are really

1017
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,920
good

1018
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,440
i think that that's unfortunately very

1019
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,200
problematic

1020
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,240
the people who have soft skills and

1021
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,280
technical skills

1022
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,640
are the sorts of people that i want to

1023
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,880
work with hire and work

1024
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,040
for and i think that that's important

1025
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,839
so i don't care whether you're junior or

1026
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,440
ciso watching this

1027
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,599
soft skills are critical to this

1028
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,200
industry they should be

1029
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,599
considered in the hiring process and

1030
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,200
they should be considered in people's

1031
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,880
career development

1032
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,720
but if you're into dungeon or dragon's

1033
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,000
role-playing games

1034
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,760
there's all sorts of skills up here that

1035
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,599
i think are vital

1036
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,960
somebody right now is probably thinking

1037
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
he has root cause analysis listed up

1038
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,599
there

1039
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,880
what root cause analysis we have

1040
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,400
an evil wizard who has created a cursed

1041
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,040
magical item that he is using to enslave

1042
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,119
villagers in this village

1043
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,839
how would you guys like to tackle this

1044
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:12,320
problem

1045
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,240
i'll tell you right now there's some

1046
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,440
root cause analysis

1047
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,800
and cooperative problem solving

1048
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
happening in that d d group

1049
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,000
right five whys why is the wizard doing

1050
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,880
this

1051
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,520
right oh because he was betrayed by the

1052
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,000
king

1053
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,160
why did the king betray him well

1054
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,680
actually the king's not a really good

1055
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,880
person he betrayed him because the

1056
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,400
wizard was going to try to album because

1057
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,079
the king was stealing all kinds of money

1058
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,280
from all the people

1059
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
saying he was putting it back into you

1060
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,800
know infrastructure projects but really

1061
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,680
he was just banking

1062
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,640
an offshore goblin account why is nobody

1063
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,240
investigating this and why are we

1064
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,920
working for the king again when he's

1065
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
actually the bad guy

1066
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,720
there five wise in the d d scenario

1067
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,760
right problem solving some other things

1068
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,119
that i think are going to be really

1069
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,359
important is active listening we've kind

1070
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,960
of talked about communication a little

1071
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,599
bit

1072
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,359
there are some really excellent

1073
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,240
communicators when they're communicating

1074
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,079
at you we probably all know some people

1075
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,280
like this

1076
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,280
but they are not good at listening

1077
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,240
right so active listening is a skill you

1078
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,280
pick up in d d

1079
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,000
real quick right because the dm will say

1080
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
something like are you sure you want to

1081
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,320
do that

1082
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,599
and then you have to be like oh my

1083
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,320
goodness am i sure

1084
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,160
so i'm going to wrap up in about another

1085
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,760
two minutes

1086
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,280
we have some gamification and

1087
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,440
storytelling those are big things in our

1088
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,040
industry that are coming about

1089
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,440
if you're familiar with role playing

1090
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,400
then those are

1091
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
areas in the industry that are growing

1092
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,720
that you can lean into

1093
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,240
so my last little bit here is so

1094
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,160
if the non-tech or soft skills are so

1095
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,040
critical where's the training

1096
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
i've hired multiple people i've gone

1097
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,800
through zero training about the correct

1098
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,079
way to hire people

1099
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,160
i've written job wrecks i have zero

1100
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,200
training about how to write job wrecks

1101
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,720
i do have some training on some of the

1102
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
soft skills i was lucky enough to attend

1103
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,040
the

1104
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,079
air force osi two-week

1105
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,200
in-person training for leaders

1106
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,160
where we talked about emotional and iq

1107
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,440
which is eq

1108
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,040
and communication but in this industry

1109
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,720
if we are going to tell people that the

1110
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
non-tech skills are critical

1111
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,760
we also have to identify training

1112
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,800
and make training available for

1113
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
the non-technical skills as well so

1114
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,240
that's sort of the last thing i added in

1115
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,160
here and this is more of a

1116
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,599
something for us all to think about

1117
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,280
because for any for

1118
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,119
any of these problems to get solved it's

1119
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,880
going to take all of us to try and help

1120
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,720
solve the problems

1121
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,160
so i'm on twitter i'm at one mr stoner

1122
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,240
you shoot me an email i'll get back to

1123
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,680
you if you have questions

1124
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,400
and i think there is about 15 minutes

1125
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
before the keynote

1126
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,400
so i'm gonna keep an eye on discord and

1127
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,240
if there are questions i will be over in

1128
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,520
the expert track

1129
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,599
to answer your questions or if you have

1130
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,280
questions later you can always hit me up

1131
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,839
on

1132
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,920
on twitter i'm also on linkedin i'm

1133
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,119
pretty easy to find

1134
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,280
i am not the john stoner that works at

1135
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,200
splunk that is another person who is my

1136
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,320
doppelganger

1137
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,560
and despite trying to contact jon stoner

1138
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,160
he has not replied to me

1139
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,760
he has spoken at sands that is a

1140
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,160
different john stoner

1141
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,080
but i think that's a wrap for me today

1142
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,330
[Music]

1143
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,079
all right so i feel like you came in

1144
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,800
chaotic good but you left lawful good

1145
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,079

were there any questions that i missed

1147
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,040

1150
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,640
in your various phrases that we thought

1151
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,160
were funny um

1152
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,359
i don't think i missed any comments

1153

1154
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,359
questions questions i scrolled through i

1155
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,800
noticed that you were like replying in

1156
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,640
real time while still giving your talk

1157
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,359
and i was like

1158
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,440
that is a level of multitasking in the

1159
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,560
brain

1160
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,800

1161
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,079

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,240
i have four screens up so i always have

1163
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,640
a timer up somewhere on one screen

1164
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,119
so i know where my time's at and then on

1165
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,119

1166
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,960
try to look multitasking

1167
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,800
real quick real quick funny story on

1168
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,079
that is when i was still

1169
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,480
in the army i had all my merc channels

1170

like 20 merc channels up on one of my

1172
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,960
big screens

supporting real-time operations in

1174

it's funny because

1181
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,359
as we uh bring more tech to like the

1182
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,119
soldier on the battlefield

1183
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,119
they are so used to so many inputs from

1184
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,400
like video games

1185
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,640
especially and all the tech everybody

1186
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,760
has all the time

1187
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,359
it's really interesting that i think

1188
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,359
humans are changing to be able to

1189
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,400
process

1190
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,800
um more information real time from

1191
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,599
multiple sources

1192
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,680
that's very very interesting it

1193
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
definitely might be something that

1194
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,119
you're better at at age 25

1195
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,920
than age 44 as well i'm not saying it is

1196
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,319
but

1197
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,560
it might be it might be one of those

1198
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,480
things too

1199
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,520
i mean i think there's also a level of

1200
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,359
structure that you apply to it as well

1201
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,400
have you ever run a military war game

1202
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,760
that had cyber in it

1203
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,040
uh not directly i was involved in some

1204
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,760
exercises a little bit but not some of

1205
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,960
the full-scale ones but

1206
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,400
actually for one unit i did develop

1207
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,000
the closest i would say i did was

1208
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,760
developing sort of this

1209
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,880
uh capstone exercise where we made an

1210
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,160
entire sort of like

1211
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,760
quasi-anonymous hacker-esque

1212
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,280
you know we had like their fake twitter

1213
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,040
profiles and fake news articles and

1214
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,240
everything like that and that was sort

1215
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,400
of gamification of the capstone

1216
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,200
um and we would run that routinely um

1217
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,640
someone else mentioned backdoors and

1218
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,359
breaches

1219
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,119
i am also an incident master with

1220
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,119
hackback gaming which is sort of like a

1221
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,839
new thing where we do like a two-hour

1222
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,319
rpg style incident response and i've

1223
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,520
been involved in a couple of those

1224
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,720
they've been super fun

1225
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,560
because most tabletops are on incident

1226
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,640
response are generally not fun

1227
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,079
so there's a lot of stuff like back

1228
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,839
doors and breaches and hack back gaming

1229
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,359
and you're gonna see more of this

1230
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,319
gamification is a big thing um the

1231
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,400
military's really into gamification

1232
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,960
of training and a lot of a lot of the

1233
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,720
commercial sectors moving that direction

1234
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,280
uh

1235
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,960
go ahead please uh give a shout out to a

1236
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,760
founder of mine

1237
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,920
uh named keenan skelly who has created a

1238
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,440
company called insight

1239
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,040
and she's done that where they have

1240
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,640
gamified um

1241
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,480
cyber hygiene learning right everybody

1242
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,680
who's been dod

1243
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,040
remembers your terrible annual

1244
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,560
training requirement right everybody

1245
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,839
just clicks through it and everything

1246
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,200
right

1247
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,440
and so um that's something i'm hoping to

1248
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,960
bring to the next grim con

1249
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,280
uh is the opportunity for folks to get

1250
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,839
to play that

1251
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,880
yeah we we all we all love doing those

1252
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,960
trainings that only run in like the

1253
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,520
oldest web browser possible

1254
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,400
man you must use ie9 and have java

1255
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,200
enabled

1256
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,480
for this dodd never mind never mind

1257
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,920
active action it's not as bad as the jaw

1258
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,319
the i think uh the new jersey or

1259
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,839
something like that their um

1260
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,400
unemployment website it said you can use

1261
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,960
ie7 or netscape

1262
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,680
um and at the beginning of the pandemic

1263
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,680
so bad

1264
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,000
i mean i think that's a real like that

1265
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
would demonstrate that you have

1266
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,680
a lot of information security knowledge

1267
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,000
if you can install and run

1268
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,440
like mosaic then

1269
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,680
you're good at this stuff i get it

1270
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
that's the next like ctf is like the

1271
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,920
first person to install windows 3 to

1272
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,760
like go get some flags or whatever

1273
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,160
i have absolutely spent like at least

1274
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,400
three hours in the ctf trying to install

1275
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,520
sage math with the right python and then

1276
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,280
it took me an hour to actually write the

1277
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,960
write the solution

1278
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,839
but i was gonna say i i learned um how

1279
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:38,800
to

1280
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,960
uh write exploits uh through ctf and i

1281
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,359
think it was the gamified atmosphere

1282
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,240
that made it so fun and entertaining for

1283
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,880
for me i

1284
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,640
i don't think that i would have wanted

1285
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,920
to spend my weekends

1286
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,240
uh doing this at the very beginning had

1287
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,920
i not been surrounded by people and had

1288
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,359
we not been trying to

1289
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,040
um rank uh on ctf time

1290
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,240
so i think there's a lot of

1291
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,880
um educational components and upskilling

1292
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,960
components that could get gamified

1293
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,119
because if i have to attend another boot

1294
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,560
camp which i actually have to attend a

1295
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,599
pmp bootcamp

1296
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,839
but i'm so tired of like that sort of

1297
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,720
training and that sort of methodology

1298
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,800
i would much rather have some pmp rpg

1299
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,599
because it would be fun right and i

1300
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,720
think

1301
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,640
right in the chat earlier we were

1302
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,400
talking about this a little bit

1303
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,720
and you know about the gamification and

1304
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,520
like the training

1305
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,720
issues um if the training was

1306
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,040
fun we also might be able to like get

1307
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,800
some people that otherwise wouldn't be

1308
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,960
in the field interested in the field

1309
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,119
earlier as well right because we're

1310
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,839
we're also not solving the job shortage

1311
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,839
uh everything we're doing in the

1312
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,040
industry is not working well

1313
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,520
i will say i i did just take a training

1314
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,520
that was not gamified at all but it was

1315
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:57,920
like

1316
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,040
tried to have a fun gui and it was

1317
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,000
far more painful than just the uh boring

1318
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,800
boring train

1319
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
trainings because i couldn't i couldn't

1320
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,000
click through it

1321
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,599
i had to sit oh man it was there was a

1322
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,240
time

1323
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,560
yeah as opposed to trainings that don't

1324
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,240
let you advance the slide

1325
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,960
or pause if you click out of the tab i'm

1326
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,920
i'm looking at you

1327
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,720
big consulting firms in particular to

1328
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,400
make sure i do the training

1329
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,920
maybe we could make the training better

1330
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,560
and more

1331
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,560
interesting there's a hack to this

1332
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,000
508 compatibility

1333
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,760
is which folks with disabilities have to

1334
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,599
be able to access the content

1335
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,640
so if you go through 508 you can just

1336
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,000
read the text to get through it and

1337
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,880
you're not beholden to the video

1338
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,640
that's a good shout well let me uh

1339
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,160
let me get off of here so we get the

1340
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,839
keynote started
