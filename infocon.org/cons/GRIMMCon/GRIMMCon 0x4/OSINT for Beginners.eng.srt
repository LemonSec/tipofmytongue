1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,480
my own face keeps popping back up at me

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,799
there we go

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,440
hi um today i want to talk about uh how

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,519
to get started with really basic level

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,559
ocean

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,480
i've been doing ocean research for years

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,000
in various ways for

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
various reasons i started out while

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,440
working in sales

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,119
and i learned how to research leads so

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,560
that i could create targeted sales

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,359
pitches for them

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,720
by incorporating things that were

14
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,840
important to them um

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,920
and i found these things by using open

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
source intelligence or ocean resources

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,519
to research the businesses and the key

18
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,800
decision makers

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,480
i was looking for things like how much

20
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
money did the company make last year

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,800
how many employees what technologies do

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,559
they have

23
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,000
when i was researching the key decision

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
makers i was looking for things

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,000
to help open a conversation what did

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,719
they like

27
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,640
what were they more likely to listen to

28
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,000
how could i connect to them on a

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,239
personal level

30
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,920
so things like their favorite sports

31
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,600
teams did they have a pet

32
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
what kind of hobbies were they into

33
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,280
anything that i could use to form a

34
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,800
personal connection to build trust with

35
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,840
the customer

36
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,640
to help build the bridge to the sale the

37
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
skills i learned researching sales leads

38
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
have translated into my security work

39
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,799
really well

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,119
first a little bit about me um when i'm

41
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,640
not working on my favorite hobby that's

42
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,520
ocean

43
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
i am a master maker i made a small human

44
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,119
he calls me mom

45
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,479
and he's by far one of the coolest

46
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,240
things that i've ever made

47
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,080
i'm hanging out with my dogs this is

48
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,240
thor lucy and skye and together i call

49
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,680
them tls

50
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,759
they also have their own instagram yep

51
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,600
i'm that dog mom

52
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
or i'm watching true crime documentaries

53
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,680
probably something about a serial killer

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,399
so osint is a really broad topic and i'm

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,320
going to narrow it down for today's talk

56
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
it's not limited to what we discuss and

57
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,240
there are lots of different ways to use

58
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,119
ocean data

59
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,399
and to perform research these are tools

60
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,079
and techniques i started out with when

61
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,680
researching people and businesses

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
and it's my hope to get you more

63
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,920
comfortable with the concept of osun

64
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,799
research by the end of our time today

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
there are lots of really great ways to

66
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,000
use the skill and it can be a

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,399
lot of fun please don't use any of the

68
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,080
information i share today to do illegal

69
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,879
things

70
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,200
thanks

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
the term open source intelligence or

72
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
osin describes a type of information and

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,480
how it's used

74
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
basically it's any type of information

75
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,520
available to the public

76
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,200
even if it's behind a paywall that's

77
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,640
used for research intelligence or recon

78
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,400
how that information is used can vary

79
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,640
vastly osints used by journalists

80
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,080
legal professionals security

81
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
professionals librarians and so many

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,560
more it's a very broad field

83
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
ocean researching is a great skill to

84
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,319
grow and it adds really well to your

85
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,480
security team's techniques

86
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,120
we all use ocean type data every day

87
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
from personal things like looking up a

88
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,360
phone number

89
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
finding an address looking to see if

90
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,200
that ex from high school's on facebook

91
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
i'm joking please don't stop people do

92
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,519
our jobs well we might look up a

93
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,920
potentially malicious ip address or file

94
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,720
hash or

95
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
check systems and showdan or research

96
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,599
apt behavior

97
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,239
high sutton and bellingcat are really

98
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
great resources for oasis information

99
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,680
this graphic shows the different types

100
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,519
of ocean information like social media

101
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,599
geospatial data commercial registrations

102
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,319
and more

103
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,040
it's all organized into what type of

104
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
data it is so it makes it really easy to

105
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,159
take a look and see where you might

106
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,120
find information

107
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,640
so how can you use um

108
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
the mindset and skills we use to

109
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
research threats in our environment is

110
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
really similar to the

111
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,360
skills used to find people i enjoy

112
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
researching and i enjoy digging into

113
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,879
really fine details and if that's

114
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,159
something that you enjoy

115
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,840
you'll enjoy ocean as well there's tons

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,000
of information available out there

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,760
about people what they like where they

118
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,120
live what their habits are

119
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,239
and so much more most people in security

120
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,599
are familiar with the reasons we should

121
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,040
keep our personal data private but

122
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
unfortunately the average user is not

123
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,400
and they leave a heavy digital trail

124
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
scattered with information

125
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
discussing how this information could be

126
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
used by malicious actors with your end

127
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
users can help protect them

128
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
as well as the company by making them

129
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,519
aware of the concepts of targeted sphere

130
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,560
phishing attacks

131
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,238
or other social engineering attacks

132
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,839
where personal information could be used

133
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,358
to manipulate them

134
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,520
there's a great scene in mr robot where

135
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,120
elliott the main character is trying to

136
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
gain access to a target's account

137
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,479
he looks at their social media account

138
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,600
for words that can be used in a

139
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,320
dictionary attack to crack the passwords

140
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
he's able to gain information from their

141
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
accounts like their favorite sports team

142
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,600
their address their pet's name and so on

143
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,880
there have been a few times in my

144
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
professional life where i've used osun

145
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
to track back an external malicious

146
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,759
email or username

147
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
and personally i like to participate in

148
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,560
osync capture the flag events or ctfs

149
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,080
where you search for missing people to

150
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,759
gain points or flags

151
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
and compete against other people to get

152
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
the most points these can be really

153
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
challenging and they're a lot of fun

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,759
getting organized can be a real

155
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,360
challenge when you're doing an

156
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
ocean investigation there's a lot of

157
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,039
information out there and it gets really

158
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,560
hard to keep it all organized as you

159
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,919
move through an investigation

160
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,759
i like to think about where i will be

161
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,600
looking before i get started

162
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
generally i look at things like public

163
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,720
records social media

164
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
general web searching to see what's on

165
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
major search engines

166
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,360
because the majority of the internet

167
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,880
isn't accessible from major search

168
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
engines i do occasionally like to look

169
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
at the deep or the dark web

170
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,840
you'll want to think about who your

171
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
target is and focus mostly on things

172
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
that they might interact with

173
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,919
social media is a great place to get

174
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,360
started with your search i've had a lot

175
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,560
of success

176
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
finding information about people on

177
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
social media and most people have some

178
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,039
kind of presence on there

179
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,639
once i was working on finding

180
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,160
information for a missing child as part

181
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
of a ctf where i was able to pivot off a

182
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
family member's account to get a lead on

183
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,440
where she could potentially be

184
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
how i did that was through a very simple

185
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,039
google search i searched the young

186
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,280
the young girl's name and her location

187
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,600
and up popped her grandfather's obituary

188
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
obituaries can be a great resource they

189
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,199
often list the first and last name of

190
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,240
family members

191
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,039
sometimes with their locations i checked

192
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,400
those names and i searched them all on

193
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
social media until i found her sister's

194
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,880
account

195
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
on her sister's account there was a

196
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
recent picture of her her sister and a

197
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,720
boy

198
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
by digging into that boy i was able to

199
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,919
see that she had recently been with him

200
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,960
and i was able to submit that

201
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
information to be included in the

202
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,199
investigation package

203
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
mind mapping is a really great way to

204
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,479
start laying out your investigation

205
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,160
it's also great to organize thoughts for

206
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,600
any large project

207
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
it helps to have one place to throw all

208
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,479
your ideas and then just link them

209
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,080
together visually

210
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
it works really well for ocean and it's

211
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,000
a great tool for beginners

212
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
it can help you keep track during an

213
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,400
investigation and is great for a ctf

214
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
to help you make sure you get all those

215
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
flags this mind map is created by a

216
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,960
member of the ocean community for xmind

217
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,720
it does have a free version the um

218
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
it's really thorough and it's really

219
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000
easy to use and it's one of my go-to's

220
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
when i want to use a mind map i like it

221
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,759
because it has links built into each

222
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,479
section

223
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,639
and you can customize those tool links

224
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,599
based on what you want

225
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,960
when i'm doing a longer investigation i

226
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
usually organize a trello board

227
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,960
something like this inside each card i

228
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
can attach artifacts or if they're of

229
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
extremely sensitive nature i just make a

230
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,720
note of where i've stored them

231
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
it's important to track your work for

232
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,919
many reasons the biggest is that it's

233
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,039
helpful when handing the

234
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,360
to investigation organizers they need a

235
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,479
clear understanding of what you're

236
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,720
giving them and how you found it

237
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,080
so that it can be handed over in the

238
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,599
investigation package that will be given

239
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,960
to authorities

240
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,080
it doesn't matter if you're

241
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
investigating a missing person a center

242
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,360
of a malicious email

243
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
in both cases they're going to want to

244
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,639
know how you came to your conclusion

245
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,639
and if the information is for a ctf you

246
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,759
need to provide this

247
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,560
to get your points

248
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
if you're doing a simple investigation

249
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,160
say for a ctf or if those tools feel a

250
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
little overwhelming an excel spreadsheet

251
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,720
is great it keeps the information easy

252
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
to read and organize

253
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
i like to place a title at the top with

254
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,240
the name of the missing person

255
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,039
or the username that i'm looking for any

256
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,720
details that were provided to me at the

257
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
top like a missing person's poster or a

258
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,240
brief summary of the case

259
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
i separate the columns to list what i've

260
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,120
found in the documentation to support it

261
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
also never underestimate the importance

262
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,160
of a good

263
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,479
bound notebook to take notes in as

264
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,599
you're working through things

265
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,879
it's helpful to have something just to

266
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,919
jot things down into

267
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,679
so tools and resources there are a ton

268
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,679
of resources available for free to help

269
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,959
with investigations

270
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
i'm going to share a few things that i

271
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
used when i got started that i still use

272
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
almost every time

273
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
while using tools can be controversial

274
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,399
in osen research because tools sometimes

275
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,920
break or they go away i

276
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,839
personally find it's a great way to get

277
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,440
started and familiar with the different

278
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,360
types of information out there

279
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
to me it's a little bit less

280
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
overwhelming when a tool like spiderfoot

281
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
can do a quick scan

282
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,880
and provide you some starting points

283
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
it's important to have a backup plan

284
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,640
and for that i'll talk about google

285
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,120
torquing

286
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
this is the ocean framework it's one of

287
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
the first resources i started using when

288
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,920
i started doing osen

289
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,200
it's a great place to start for

290
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,399
investigations and it has a

291
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,000
comprehensive list of sites

292
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,839
as you open the topics you'll find links

293
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,440
to websites where you can run searches

294
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,200
on different types of artifacts

295
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,040
to see what additional data is available

296
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
about them people often use

297
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,040
the same or similar usernames across

298
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,880
multiple platforms so this resource can

299
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,399
come in handy if you hit a dead end or

300
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
you just don't know where to start

301
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
in one of the missing children cases i

302
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,519
worked as part of a ctf

303
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,279
their facebook account was really locked

304
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,640
down so i couldn't see what they had

305
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,279
posted

306
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,800
and i wasn't getting much off friends

307
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,640
and family members either

308
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
this is becoming increasingly more

309
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,760
common with younger people as they move

310
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
away from facebook in favor of other

311
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,279
social media sites

312
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,640
i was able to find their instagram

313
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
account by searching their username

314
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,440
using namecheck

315
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
it's a list off of the osun framework

316
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,040
and their instagram account was public

317
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,959
and more recently active which led to a

318
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,560
new list of friends and associations i

319
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,760
was able to include in the investigation

320
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,920
there are also links to dark web search

321
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,200
tools here and if you're going to use

322
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,519
them

323
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,959
you will need a tor browser and i

324
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,479
strongly recommend using a vpn

325
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,240
so i'm going to walk you through a

326
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,000
little bit of the ocean framework so you

327
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,720
can kind of see what it does

328
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,399
so the first place that i usually come

329
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,640
is here into usernames

330
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,200
you can search specific sites so if you

331
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,360
happen to know you know maybe they're

332
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
in their late teens early 20s and maybe

333
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
they have a tinder you can come in here

334
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,519
and use

335
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,959
that search to find their tinder

336
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,279
accounts um

337
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,720
or you can come into name check

338
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,560
and run a quick search all of them work

339
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,920
just like a regular search engine

340
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,880
they're super easy to use

341
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,640
type in your username you hit go

342
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,920
and down at the bottom here it's going

343
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
to load up a whole bunch of

344
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,560
um different account sites now the

345
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,519
yellow means

346
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,240
that the account is not valid so it's

347
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,600
not a name that could be used at that

348
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,079
site

349
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,680
the green mean that means that it's

350
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,839
available and the gray means that it's

351
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,800
in use

352
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,760
if you click on one of the in use it'll

353
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,240
actually

354
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,000
show you that account

355
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,519
and if you get a red one it just means

356
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,959
that it didn't work there's something

357
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,640
wrong either with the site or it's wrong

358
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
on the other end

359
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,720
there's a search tool for email

360
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,279
addresses

361
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,120
that's them is incredibly useful

362
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,959
um i don't have an email address that's

363
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,320
going to come up on here

364
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
but this one here is is really great and

365
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
it'll actually link you back to any

366
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,880
known

367
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,399
addresses that are tied to the email

368
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:10,160
address as well which is really awesome

369
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,200
if you're looking for a business or

370
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,639
you're trying to figure out the format

371
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,519
of an email

372
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,600
there's tools for that as well so you

373
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,519
can either use corporate email formats

374
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,720
or email format here

375
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,399
um and it'll give you an idea of what

376
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,120
that company's email format might be and

377
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,639
this is based off other people who have

378
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,480
used it so this is this may not be valid

379
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
because it only has a score of two but

380
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
other ones will have scores of up to ten

381
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,040
that'll give you an idea of whether or

382
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
not it's valid

383
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,760
there's also a link to breach data

384
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,440
intelligence x is a really

385
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,600
great site and you can type in an email

386
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,959
address in there and it'll give you

387
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
anything that's associated with

388
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,240
for breaches so you can also put in like

389
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,279
it says urls

390
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,440
or domains or ip addresses there's a

391
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,880
bunch of different things you can put in

392
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,720
here to get back information about what

393
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,920
where it might have been included in a

394
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
breach

395
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,079
there's also other social networks which

396
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,279
is important because

397
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,959
when you're thinking about ocean you may

398
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,320
not always be looking for someone who's

399
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,519
here in the united states you may be

400
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,880
looking for someone in another country

401
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,160
and they do use different

402
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,839
different social media sites than we do

403
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,360
here in america

404
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
so you want to be aware of what those

405
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,000
might possibly be

406
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,639
one of the sites i used to use a lot is

407
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,240
actually a public record

408
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,839
site and

409
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,399
i have a funny story about this site i

410
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,399
had a package delivered to my house

411
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,399
about a week before christmas

412
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,639
and i called hsn and i said this doesn't

413
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,079
belong to me but it was shipped to my

414
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,839
address how do i find out

415
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,959
who this belongs to and they said i'll

416
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,320
send it back to us we'll send it out i

417
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,199
said well there's no way they're going

418
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,560
to get it before christmas there's just

419
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,519
no way and it was

420
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,079
very clearly a bunch of camera equipment

421
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,560
so i went online and i used this

422
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,760
site to find the person um and it i was

423
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,199
able to find their

424
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,240
the purchase of their um

425
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,079
home but i was also able to find their

426
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,360
arrest record

427
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,639
so it was a little awkward when i was

428
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
dropping it off but i was able to return

429
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
the package which was great

430
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,680
down at the bottom here is a list of

431
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,920
tools

432
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,279
and there is some references for

433
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,839
automation for virtual machines we're

434
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,040
going to talk about virtual machines a

435
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,399
little bit later but this is a great

436
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,079
link to some of them buscador is no

437
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,279
longer supported

438
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,880
um so i don't believe that that link

439
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,959
will work but tracelabs has a really

440
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,320
great vm

441
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,560
and we'll talk about that later one of

442
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,800
my favorite things is linked off of here

443
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,399
and it's a game

444
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,199
um and that is geo guesser geo guests

445
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,800
are super fun and if you're trying to

446
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,199
learn

447
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,920
more about figuring out where photos

448
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,839
come from this is a really great game to

449
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
play

450
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
so spider foot is another tool that i

451
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,920
use pretty often

452
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,079
it's got a quite a few capabilities i'm

453
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,600
going to show you how i would use it to

454
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,199
look up an email address

455
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,639
there are two versions that are free

456
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,079
there's a cloud hosted edition and

457
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,519
there's some limitations with that and

458
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,120
then there's an open source downloadable

459
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,000
version that has

460
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,880
less limitations i generally like the

461
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,639
web-based because it's less work for me

462
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,720
to maintain and i can access it from

463
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,959
any machine i don't have to be on my own

464
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,320
machine

465
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,560
if you want to use all the features they

466
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,079
have pay plans but unless you're

467
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,920
incorporating ocean into your security

468
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,759
program the open source or hobby license

469
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,600
is probably going to do what you need

470
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
so when you log into spiderfoot you'll

471
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,160
see there's a lot of different options

472
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,680
if you're using the free version

473
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,199
the only option that's available to you

474
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,599
is scan

475
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,199
and to do a new scan just hit the new

476
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,758
scan button

477
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
you can put in all sorts of different

478
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,759
things into the search section you can

479
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,519
put in email addresses you can put in ip

480
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,800
addresses

481
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,360
um you can put in real human names um so

482
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,880
i could search like siobhan kelleher and

483
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,959
see what comes back there

484
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,680
um there's modules that you can tune

485
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,839
down here but the api keys are not

486
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,240
permitted unless you have a pay license

487
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,839
one of the cool things that did happen

488
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,000
recently is they increased the in

489
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the individual scan limit from 15

490
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,440
minutes to four hours so if you're

491
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,120
scanning a big domain that gives you a

492
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
lot more time to scan which is super

493
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,839
cool

494
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
to run the scan you just hit run scan

495
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,519
now and then it refreshes and will run

496
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,040
your scan

497
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,639
i've already run this scan so we can go

498
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,160
back and look at it

499
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,839
from the main site

500
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,920
hopefully there we go

501
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,240
so this is the page that comes back once

502
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
you've run a scan it gives you

503
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,839
i know it's an email address i found

504
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,160
some usernames i found some raw data

505
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,359
i found accounts on external sites

506
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,720
and then sometimes you'll get another

507
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
column that will say um

508
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,079
packed email accounts which is just

509
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,640
breach data if you get breach data you

510
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
can take that and then put it back into

511
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,039
the intelligence

512
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,919
um website and then find out what

513
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,000
breaches it was included in

514
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,359
sometimes you can get a password there

515
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,880
now you don't ever want to log into a

516
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,760
user's account

517
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,080
because that's just not a good idea but

518
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
you can provide that to whoever

519
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,799
you're giving the investigation

520
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,919
information to and that can be really

521
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,320
helpful

522
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,160
here you have a list of all the websites

523
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
that it's included in and

524
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,799
just because a username is associated

525
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,880
to a site doesn't mean that it's

526
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,919
actually

527
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,440
that user so you need to do a little bit

528
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,520
of investigative research to see if

529
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,600
that fits the profile of the person that

530
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,880
you're looking for or if there's any

531
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
actual evidence that you can tie

532
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,200
that account to the user that you're

533
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,080
looking for

534
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,160
but this gives you a good starting space

535
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,480
there's also a really cool little node

536
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
graph and this is great

537
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
if you're doing an executive report

538
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
because we know how much executives

539
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
love graphics and this shows you how

540
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,240
everything is linked together which is

541
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,720
really cool

542
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,360
so another quick demo i want to show you

543
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
is google dorking sometimes

544
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,039
tools fail so it's important to have a

545
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,160
backup plan

546
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,919
google dorking is a really quick and

547
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,679
effective way to search google for

548
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
something

549
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,240
so say for example i want to look at

550
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,799
um something specifically on twitter.com

551
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,160
i would type site

552
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,520
twitter.com and then i can type in

553
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,879
in text let's say malware

554
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,320
that's going to come back with mostly

555
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,440
results that search

556
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
just twitter.com if i was to do a google

557
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,960
search and type in

558
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
just twitter.com and malware i'm going

559
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,080
to get a lot more

560
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,240
stuff that's not necessarily related to

561
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,679
what i'm looking for

562
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,919
so that kind of limits it down so that

563
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,640
you don't have to

564
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:39,600
dig through a bunch of irrelevant sites

565
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,679
other things you can do you can add a

566
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,880
and or an or and put

567
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,840
and you'll want to use quotes if you put

568
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,440
these are called boolean operators

569
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,400
that's not really important

570
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,160
oh well that one didn't come back with

571
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
much but it does come back with

572
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,080
malware and exchange so you can see that

573
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
it's listing the new cds for exchange

574
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,799
which is really cool

575
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,840
um there's a really great website that

576
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,720
has a ton

577
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,039
of different google doors and you can

578
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,400
use google docking for all sorts of

579
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,679
things like if you want to find s3

580
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,960
buckets or if you want to find

581
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
api keys that are hanging out there on

582
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,240
the internet you can google dork for

583
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,840
that kind of stuff

584
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
be careful doing that sometimes people

585
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,720
don't get thrilled when you find their

586
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:34,320
open doors

587
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,240
all right so i've run into a few cases

588
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,159
where the account or the images i was

589
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,159
looking for were deleted so i'm going to

590
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,679
show you the wayback machine which is

591
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,000
one of my favorite tools um sometimes i

592
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,480
use it to look at things like old

593
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,159
message boards from like way back in the

594
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,919
day because i get a little nostalgic

595
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,000
and the way back machine has them and

596
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,919
google cache which is super super easy

597
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,400
to use

598
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,440
so the wayback machine does take a long

599
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,360
time so i've preloaded the sites so that

600
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,640
we don't have to sit here waiting for

601
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,320
them to load

602
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,679
you come into the wayback machine you

603
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,880
type in whatever it is that you're

604
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,240
looking for

605
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,760
down at the bottom here you'll see this

606
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
site this whole site has not been

607
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,280
crawled but

608
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,120
archived pages were crawled so i would

609
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
click on this and then it loads up

610
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,679
this site these are all the posts that

611
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,039
i've made from my twitter account

612
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,480
since it's creation i decided to pick on

613
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,440
this one

614
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,200
and this loads so i get like a little

615
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,360
march 15th 2020. there's a little

616
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,960
snapshot there because that's when i

617
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,280
posted it this is when it's snapshotted

618
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,440
and then when i click on that it loads

619
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,640
up here so you can see that this is the

620
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
wayback machine there's one capture it's

621
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
from this date if there were other

622
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
captures of this site

623
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,960
there would be other um highlights here

624
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,240
where you could click on and see other

625
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,520
versions of it which is

626
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
really cool so you can see how things

627
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,000
have changed over time

628
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
with um

629
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:12,960
google cache you just type

630
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,480
and then the website hang on i have it

631
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,679
over here so i can just copy it

632
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,120
and there's my cached version and you

633
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,039
can see when it was cached

634
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,520
by looking at the view source so this

635
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,880
says it was cached on february 15th 2021

636
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,400
and if you look at this version

637
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,960
you can see that there's like no

638
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,480
extension in my name that's the easiest

639
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,760
thing to notice here and then if you

640
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,960
look at today's

641
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,480
you can see that there's an extension in

642
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
my name because i'm here today

643
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,840
so you can see that there's a difference

644
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
in the site so if you're looking for

645
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,760
maybe

646
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,799
a twitter account that was deleted or an

647
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,000
image that was deleted from

648
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
twitter or from any website you can look

649
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,559
at it that way

650
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,520
there we go

651
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,559
okay so another tool i want to show you

652
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,159
that's specific to

653
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,039
twitter is called the visualized and

654
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,080
this is just

655
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,840
super cool i really enjoy this tool

656
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,760
so the visualized keeps trends on social

657
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,679
media so you can click and see trends on

658
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,200
twitter you can click into trends on

659
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
spotify

660
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,480
you can see that turns on medium

661
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,840
it's really really cool you can follow

662
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,400
trends or you can look at a specific

663
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
twitter timeline

664
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,840
this is useful if you want to see really

665
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,919
quick all on one page what someone's

666
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,039
been posting about

667
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,320
what their um their most tweeted

668
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,080
like common words are other people that

669
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,039
they interact with

670
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,320
so if i look up my twitter

671
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,919
you can see um all of the posts that

672
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:06,480
i've made

673
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
right here on the right hand side you

674
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,039
can see how frequently i post

675
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,080
you can see um who the most common

676
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,640
people i

677
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,720
interact with on twitter are so you can

678
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
see what my relationships are

679
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,120
you can see what my most common hashtags

680
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,840
are which of course today it's grim con

681
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
and then you can see that i'm mostly

682
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
active on twitter on friday at 11

683
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,600
o'clock because i never sleep

684
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
um and it's coven so what else am i

685
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,919
doing on friday night

686
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,760
uh this information is all exportable

687
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,200
which is really cool as well if you want

688
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
to include it in a report

689
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,880
but this is one of my favorite tools for

690
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,240
looking at a twitter account

691
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,279
because it gives you all that

692
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,320
information in one quick snapshot

693
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,000
another tool that i've recently

694
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
discovered is called a

695
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,240
tick buddy and it's actually a creator

696
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,960
platform

697
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,919
for tick-tock but it has a side effect

698
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,159
of being a really cool ocean tool

699
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,720
so you can come in here and you can find

700
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,159
a creator

701
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,200
um you can search by all kinds of

702
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,799
different things so if we go to creator

703
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,919
search

704
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,679
i can enter a keyword i can enter like

705
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,039
cats or

706
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,080
funny i can search by regions

707
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,159
if i have an actual username i can do

708
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,520
that so if

709
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,440
i search by kevin hart

710
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,400
his tick tock comes out and this gives

711
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,720
me

712
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
analytics about his ranking and you know

713
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,000
things that are kind of just kind of

714
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,640
cool but

715
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
maybe not so helpful but if i click on

716
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
video analytics

717
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
it'll actually show me all of the videos

718
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,600
that he's posted and how often they've

719
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,400
been posted

720
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,640
and that can be really helpful if you

721
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,159
happen to have a username

722
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,679
you can come in here a lot of people

723
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,840
again use the same username from site to

724
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,480
site

725
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,159
and post it in here and see if they've

726
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,679
got a tick tock

727
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,039
and that might give you more information

728
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,880
especially about younger

729
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,520
younger people

730
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,159
i think you're doing good on time but we

731
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,279
are uh

732
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,919
quickly approaching 2 30. it's 2 25 now

733
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,320
so

734
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,480
you do have five minutes all right

735
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,919
perfect thank you

736
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,520
i got like five slides left yes

737
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,600
all right it's um it's really important

738
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
to make sure you perform ocean research

739
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,159
safely

740
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,520
um two things that i would strongly

741
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,679
recommend you keep to keep yourself safe

742
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,120
is using a virtual machine

743
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,159
um or a vm and using a vpn you can roll

744
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,320
your own vpn if you want i use proton

745
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,799
they're all pretty decent whatever you

746
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,400
use it is best practice to attempt to

747
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
connect from that area the target is in

748
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,039
sometimes that's not possible because

749
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,559
social media connections in that area

750
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:32,880
just

751
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,880
aren't allowed you can use a proxy in

752
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,640
that case or just connect from another

753
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,360
location

754
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,200
whatever you do it's really important

755
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,880
not to mix your personal connection

756
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,080
with an investigation it is also

757
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,919
best practice to use a dedicated machine

758
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,520
when you're doing ocean

759
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,200
that you don't use for your personal or

760
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,360
work but this can be a barrier for a lot

761
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,120
of people when you're competing in a ctf

762
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,360
i have always used a well isolated vm

763
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,960
because an extra machine is just out of

764
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,080
reach for me

765
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,200
i use a mac so i use vmware fusion

766
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,799
and like i said there are links off of

767
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,200
that the ocean framework where you can

768
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,799
grab some vms

769
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,960
or you can grab the trace the trace lab

770
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,360
ocean vm they're all really great

771
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,840
um and don't let linux intimidate you

772
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,640
they have a

773
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,960
graphical interface just like windows

774
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,559
does so if you're not comfortable in

775
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,320
linux you can just use the graphical

776
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,679
interface and work yourself

777
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,960
gently into the command line

778
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,799
when i do oc network i do have a

779
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,640
dedicated workstation for that because i

780
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,039
don't want to take anything

781
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,440
using a vm or a separate machine will

782
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,279
ensure that your personal social media

783
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,039
information and browser information

784
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,159
isn't going to spill into your

785
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,880
investigation

786
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,399
it's really important to protect your

787
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,320
personal identity by not using any of

788
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
your own personal social media

789
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,679
accounts you don't know who you're going

790
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,600
to be looking at and your personal data

791
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,240
can mess up your algorithms as well

792
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,760
and i'm sure most of you know this but

793
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,279
if you're on facebook and you're looking

794
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,559
at a user

795
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,840
and you click into their account it's

796
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
then going to recommend the account that

797
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,559
you look at them with

798
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,120
as a friend to them so they can track it

799
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,640
back right to you if you're using your

800
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,320
own personal social media account

801
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,840
a stock puppet account is a fake

802
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,559
identity that you use for recon

803
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,159
that will protect you from that

804
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,720
situation happening

805
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,559
so how do you create a sock account

806
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,039
safely when you create a sock puppet

807
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
also commonly referred to as a sock

808
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,720
you want to use an isolated system

809
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,520
behind a vpn like like a vm or something

810
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,240
like that

811
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,000
some social media sites won't allow that

812
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,360
there's a few ways around it like a

813
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,080
burner cell

814
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,399
or using a proxy service in the past

815
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,159
i've also used public wi-fi to set up a

816
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,279
sock account

817
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,360
for a ctf you probably don't need to be

818
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,799
as rigorous i've set them up

819
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,200
at home on my wi-fi in a pinch but

820
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,000
remember not

821
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,919
to use ctf socks for an actual

822
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,480
investigation

823
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,200
um because i'm not doing a long-term

824
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,120
investigation i don't do a lot of work

825
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,320
on my sock accounts

826
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,640
i just put them together follow a couple

827
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
of accounts you can use fake name

828
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,080
generator or just make something up that

829
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,559
doesn't tie back to you

830
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,000
you just want to make sure that you put

831
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,520
enough in there that they don't get shut

832
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,840
down

833
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,240
keeping your socks alive and organized

834
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,840
can be a challenge

835
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,600
i keep my socks organized in excel

836
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,440
spreadsheet so i can log into them from

837
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,039
time to time and keep them alive

838
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,039
i use my burner phone to access my stock

839
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,960
accounts you should never log into your

840
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,679
stock accounts

841
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,679
from your personal devices you should

842
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,840
never log into your personal accounts on

843
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,360
your sock devices

844
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,039
if you do either of those you've burnt

845
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,159
your burner and you've tainted your

846
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,279
socks

847
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,720
your socks should not be friends with

848
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,760
you they shouldn't be friends with

849
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
people that you know in person

850
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,120
and your socks shouldn't be friends with

851
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,520
each other just follow some obvious

852
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,000
accounts like political accounts actors

853
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,600
sports professionals whatever is

854
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
initially uh suggested to you

855
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,279
and try and think about the type of

856
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,039
target that you're going to be going

857
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,120
after

858
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,320
when you create your socks

859
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,159
so i know this seems like a lot of

860
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,600
information but please don't let it

861
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,640
overwhelm you

862
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
if you can google you can get started

863
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,240
with ocean while i've been researching

864
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
people companies and other entities

865
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,679
using ocean for years

866
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,200
i only learned ocean and social

867
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,640
engineering were a real thing a few

868
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,159
years ago at defcon

869
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,480
the first time i participated in an oc

870
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,399
ctf was at a conference in rhode island

871
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,399
about two years ago

872
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,559
since then i've competed in several ctfs

873
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,320
i've consulted on cases related to

874
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,679
domestic violence and revenge

875
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,640
pornography

876
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,399
none of this is terribly complicated

877
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,000
it's a really good skill to grow and it

878
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,080
translates really well into your day job

879
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,840
if you want to start using ocean as part

880
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,600
of your security program

881
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,720
staying organized throughout the

882
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,559
investigation has been my biggest

883
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,520
challenge

884
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,039
and the information out there is really

885
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,880
vast using some of the tools i shared

886
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,760
with you today should help you succeed

887
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,440
thank you all so much for letting me

888
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,039
share this information with you i hope

889
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,640
that you enjoyed it and that it took

890
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,720
some of the intimidation out of ocean

891
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,080
you can follow me on twitter if you'd

892
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,440
like and i'm happy to answer any

893
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,840
questions that you might have

894
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,120
all right that was awesome thank you

895
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,000
very cool so you were taking questions

896
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,799
live right

897
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,919
so uh we've got our questions

898
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,840
up and um who did the introduction here

899
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,440
delaney i believe you did so let's have

900
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,880
you run with a question

901
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,960
uh there haven't been any questions in

902
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,080
the uh discord channel yet

903
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,559
a lot of people have been recommending

904
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,919
their own resources

905
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,039
or in general just in

906
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,399
awe of the resources that you've shared

907
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,640
uh it looks like we do have a question

908
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,600
in the

909
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,960
webinar interface here do you have any

910
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,120
tips for creating a sock puppet facebook

911
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,399
account getting around

912
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,240
identity verification and other hurdles

913
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,279
yes so two two things

914
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,440
um if you're creating it for an official

915
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,559
investigation it gets a little more

916
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,240
complicated and there are proxies out

917
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,080
there that you can use that trick your

918
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,840
connection into thinking that you're

919
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
actually at a residential address i

920
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,919
think one of them's called smart proxy

921
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,480
it's been a while um but if you're

922
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,600
creating them for

923
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,519
a ctf you can probably just create them

924
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,799
from your home connection

925
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,600
um and when you need to verify you can't

926
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
use a google number anymore so you do

927
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,880
want to have

928
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,440
a burner phone to do that with and you

929
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,000
can just pick

930
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,679
up literally any cheap burner phone i've

931
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,360
heard mint mobile suggested a couple of

932
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,720
times

933
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,799
okay i know a lot of uh

934
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,080
burner phones won't accept cash

935
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,640
and and try to push for credit card

936
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,360
purchases

937
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,840
is that something that you found uh

938
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,360
issue with being tied back to you

939
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,840
on a credit line or is that not a

940
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,760
concern

941
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,360
it depends on what you're doing it for

942
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,200
um

943
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,159
if you're again if you're using it for

944
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,679
work it's a different circumstance but

945
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,399
if it's for

946
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,480
a ctf you're probably going to burn the

947
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
the sock afterwards anyway um for the

948
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,200
most part

949
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,840
so i've not i'm not worried about it

950
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,080
okay

951
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,760
so one question i had do you have like a

952
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,279
list of resources because you

953
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,679
you name some incredible tools that uh

954
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,720
the feedback uh

955
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,519
in the chat has been uh great about do

956
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,760
you have like a listing someplace or

957
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,120
some place where it's all compiled that

958
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
we can we can go and reference later

959
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,240

982
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,679
that other question we got one from

983
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,079
matthew

984
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,800
just came in so if you have any tips for

985
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
getting your sock account

986
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,239
accepted by other people and creating

987
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,560
connections that way

988
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,280
ah so it depends on who you're targeting

989
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,679
if

990
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,079
you um if you're targeting a bunch of

991
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,839
like teenagers you want your picture to

992
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,239
look

993
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,560
convincing and you want the things that

994
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
you're following to look convincing

995
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,560
sometimes if you send like a dm ahead of

996
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,719
time like hey i think you're so cute

997
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,480
um you're more likely to get a

998
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,320
connection from them than you are if you

999
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,839
just send a friend request

1000
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,918
um and then there's also the prize or

1001
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,280
spry and pray like you just friend

1002
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,960
everybody and see who steve comes back a

1003
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,399
lot of people especially on like twitter

1004
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,079
will just blindly follow accounts all

1005
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,040
