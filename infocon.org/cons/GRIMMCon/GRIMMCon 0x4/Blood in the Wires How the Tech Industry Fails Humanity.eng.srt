1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,520
hi everyone thank you for coming to my

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:03,919
talk

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,720
titled blood and wires how the tech

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,279
industry

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,480
fails humanity

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,719
now before we get started i just want to

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,560
make sure that everyone's aware

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,119
um there there is some content in here

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,480
that's going to be a little bit gritty

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,880
so uh if you just aren't don't have the

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,920
mental bandwidth

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,160
to listen to this or you've had a day

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,199
it's been a lot

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,000
uh no harm no foul if you choose not to

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,519
stick around for it

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,200
but if you couldn't tell from the title

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,280
of the of the presentation

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,480
we are going to be talking about the

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
ways that humanity is impacted by the

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,200
work that we do

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,920
so with that out of the way i would like

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,320
to

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,360
pitch you all on a new startup idea

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,520
an idea that i think is going to make

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,640
the world

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,520
a better place this idea has the

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,800
potential to profoundly

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
improve the lives of every planet on

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,320
every person on this planet but it can

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,280
only be that way with your help

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
now by the end of this talk you will be

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,560
so excited

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,200
to invest in this idea maybe not in

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,600
money

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,760
but hopefully in some of your time and

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,000
energy

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
this bold new idea though needs

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,560
something to represent it like uh

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,640
something like a mascot like something

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
that's as big as the idea

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,799
itself something like uh like an

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,560
elephant um

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,159
and if we're gonna have an elephant then

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,079
we might as well give it a name so like

45
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
why not let's just name it topsy

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
so hi my name is emily cross i've been

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,159
involved in the field of information

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,000
security for over a decade

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,520
i started my career with the us

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
intelligence agency with u.s

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,720
intelligence agencies

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
before leaving the us government for

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
jobs in the tech startup world

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,680
my current job is as an ics pen tester

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
which means that i

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,399
usually spend most of my professional

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,560
time around heavy machinery and

58
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,520
factories but you didn't come to here to

59
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,560
talk about me

60
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,200
you came to hear a talk about elephants

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
so let's get back to topsy top's the

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
elephant's story ends in 1903

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
but the story of topsy's end begins as

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
so many tragic ends do

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,000
with a format war in the 1880s

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,599
commercial electricity was coming to the

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,080
united

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
states and the greatest minds in the

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,599
world had been hard at work for

70
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,400
generations

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
trying to recapture ben franklin's

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,920
lightning in a bottle

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,480
and con in this contest two front

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,879
runners emerged direct current

75
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,280
that was championed by thomas edison and

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
alternating current

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,319
it was being championed by george

78
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,239
westinghouse and his partner nikola

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,760
tesla

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,280
and what came to be known as the war of

81
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
the currents both edison and house

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
were vying to provide the means of

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
electric generation

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,280
and distribution to the public before

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
this time humans have been burning wood

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,920
oil lamps and candles to light and heat

87
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,159
our homes and cities but you know

88
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,519
burning things comes with

89
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,120
uh with some overhead it's very

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,760
dangerous it's cumbersome

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840
and it was common for misplaced flames

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,000
to burn down entire major cities

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,440
as it did in seattle in 1889 and boston

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,879
in 1872

95
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,560
or in chicago in 1871.

96
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
both westing westinghouse and edison saw

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,680
the potential value to humanity in this

98
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
promise that electricity

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,000
brought with it they also saw the

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,840
potential monetary value in that

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,760
proposition

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,239
edison's dc power had major drawbacks

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,040
though

104
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,799
it couldn't be delivered as efficiently

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,040
as tesla and westinghouse's ac scheme

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,799
which would mean that remote areas of

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,319
the united states would be a lot more

108
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,239
difficult to power

109
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,200
dc was therefore ill-suited to the

110
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
purpose of power in large areas

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,239
ac was clearly the better technology and

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,200
we know that even today

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,640
ac was what humanity needed but as is

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,080
so often what humanity needs is not the

115
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,519
only motivating factor

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,439
in invention edison knew the business

117
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,120
cost of losing this war and he was

118
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,519
determined not to come in second

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,238
so the question for edison became how do

120
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:18,798
you win

121
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,639
a format war that you're losing

122
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,880
in november of 1887 edison received a

123
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,680
letter from a man named alfred

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
it's not like a brilliant idea for

125
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,280
electricity it was so great

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
his idea was to use electricity as a

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,040
humane

128
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,960
method for prisoner execution

129
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,880
sathik had heard the story about some

130
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
guy getting drunk and killing himself

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,560
when he touched a live generator so

132
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,720
sao thicke being a dentist and working

133
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
mostly with patients that

134
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,280
sat in a chair he thought that this

135
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
invention

136
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,560
he thought an invention that used

137
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
electricity to immediately kill a

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,639
prisoner

139
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
while seated and chair actually sounded

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
pretty great so

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,320
he penned a letter to edison asking him

142
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,680
the best way to electrocute humans

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,840
publicly edison was opposed to the death

144
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
penalty and he agitated for the

145
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,880
abolition of capital punishment

146
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
edison told sapphic that he didn't want

147
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,039
himself or his invention to be

148
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,639
associated in any way with killing

149
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,160
humans and so he

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,680
he told suffolk to kick rocks as we say

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,759
a month later suffolk sent edison

152
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,600
another pitch for the same idea

153
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,160
this time edison's answer was a little

154
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
bit different

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
he suggested that suffolk use

156
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,720
westinghouse's ac

157
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
to do the job it it seems

158
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
that in this one month period of time

159
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,560
edison noticed a business opportunity

160
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
right in front of him

161
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,680
if he could associate death by

162
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
electricity with his competitor

163
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,479
he might yet have a way to win this war

164
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
so privately edison began funding the

165
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,240
engineering and construction of the

166
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,759
world's first electric chair to

167
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,360
accomplish this goal

168
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
thus a new invention solely for the

169
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,560
purpose of

170
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,520
expediting the the killing of humans

171
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,639
efficiently

172
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,199
was born from a technology designed for

173
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,919
ultra

174
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,039
altruistic uses and it was all being

175
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,360
done

176
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,319
in the name of business

177
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,360
edison thought that if he could convince

178
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
the public that ac

179
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,800
electricity was synonymous with death

180
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,639
that he'd create just such a repulsive

181
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,440
image

182
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,280
for alternating current that the public

183
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
would just never accept it

184
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,639
edison figured that this actually

185
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,280
translated for him directly into dollars

186
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,240
and cents and

187
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
he wasn't totally wrong about that

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
in later years the term westinghouse

189
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
became a popular way of saying that

190
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,680
someone had just been executed

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,639
in an electric chair somewhere but

192
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
edison wasn't just a businessman

193
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
and he wasn't just an inventor he was

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,720
also a showman

195
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,880
he had a plan to drive home his point

196
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
about the dangers of ac with the public

197
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,520
and what he had in mind was pretty

198
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,680
gruesome

199
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
the next year in 1888 edison staged a

200
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,120
series of public animal executions

201
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,960
he would go on ending the lives of stray

202
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
animals with ac until about two years

203
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,319
later when edison upped the ante

204
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,880
in 1890 a murderer named william kemler

205
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
was placed in the chair that edison had

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
secretly helped build

207
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,759
he became the first man to die in an

208
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,360
electric chair

209
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680
the execution of william kemler was so

210
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,120
horrific

211
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
i'm going to spare you the details but

212
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,880
suffice to say that it turned out that

213
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
execution by electrocution was less

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
efficient than mr sathik and mr edison

215
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
had predicted that it would be

216
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,919
it was so ineffective in fact that

217
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
westinghouse was later reported to have

218
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,400
said

219
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,639
they could have done a better job with

220
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
an axe

221
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,639
now you might think that this failure

222
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,800
constituted an abject failure for the

223
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
entire idea of the electric chair

224
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,919
wholesale

225
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,759
and that the idea of this being used as

226
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,080
a humane tool for execution would just

227
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,479
be

228
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,960
that would be the end of the story well

229
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
the last inmate executed in the electric

230
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,759
chair in the united states was in 2013.

231
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,160
less than a decade ago some states in

232
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,280
fact still haven't

233
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,720
outlawed its use in execution

234
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,879
but emily what does this have to do with

235
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,560
an elephant not to mention one so

236
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,800
specifically named

237
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
don't worry we're getting there as

238
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,639
westinghouse won more and more contracts

239
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,039
for ac power across north america

240
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,639
the war of the currents slowly but

241
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,320
surely came to an end around 1893.

242
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
by 1900 the war of the currents was more

243
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,599
or less over but

244
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,640
in 1903 there would be one last animal

245
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,279
execution

246
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,399
topsy was a circus elephant she killed

247
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,000
three of her handlers and for this it

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,680
was decided that she needed to be put to

249
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
death

250
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,600
as a society we've come to realize over

251
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,279
the years that elephants are some of the

252
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
most gentle and empathetic creatures on

253
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,399
the planet

254
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,080
we know that they can lash out and hurt

255
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
or kill people when they're mistreated

256
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,480
so

257
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
we've since begun to treat them a little

258
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
bit better than we used to

259
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,760
we recognize that an elephant's empathy

260
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
kind of mirrors our own this is

261
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,480
especially important to remember when we

262
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,399
take note of the fact that topsy was

263
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,600
physically abused her whole life

264
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,160
we see our own humanity reflected back

265
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
at us and topsy's reaction to lifelong

266
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,920
abuse and torture

267
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
by the way that last handler that she

268
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,040
killed happened to be a drunk who

269
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,000
federal lit cigarette

270
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
so it came to be that a decade after the

271
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
war of the currents ended two of

272
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
edison's men were sent to assist in the

273
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,640
public execution of tops of the elephant

274
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,959
with westinghouse electricity in luna

275
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:43,839
park new york

276
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
in front of a crowd of locals this

277
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
execution had

278
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,240
no way of turning the tide in favor of

279
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,800
dc edison didn't stand to benefit from

280
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,160
taxi's execution

281
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,200
and yet the involvement of his company

282
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,160
in the execution of topsy stands as a

283
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,959
brutal

284
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,600
legacy of turn-of-the-century commercial

285
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
competition

286
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,160
i bet when you all came you didn't

287
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,720
expect

288
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,160
to hear a story about how

289
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,800
an elephant the treatment of an elephant

290
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
reflects our own

291
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
innate humanity but what is humanity

292
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
anyway is it people

293
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,640
sure but maybe that definition is a bit

294
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
too vague maybe humanity means

295
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,279
some other amalgamation of intangible

296
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,640
traits that

297
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
defines what it means to be human

298
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,760
philosophers and science fiction authors

299
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,360
have had us asking this question

300
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,560
for for thousands of years as technology

301
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,760
improves

302
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,079
we wonder what makes human intelligence

303
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,760
unique in comparison to

304
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,360
machine intelligence if you're from the

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,000
descarte

306
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,079
school of thought i think therefore i am

307
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,720
as proof of your unique ability to

308
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,040
apply self-reflective thought according

309
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
to descartes

310
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,040
not just to think but to exist at all

311
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
you see humans our ability our ability

312
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,120
to think

313
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,600
rather than compute this is this

314
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
inherent difference that we can

315
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,440
identify about our own meta cognition

316
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
our human intelligence is able to

317
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
compare both quantitatively in the same

318
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
way that our computers can but also

319
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,600
qualitatively that's something that our

320
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
technology just

321
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,600
isn't able to do yet and while computers

322
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,360
ability to enumerate and calculate

323
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,680
things as far surpassed our own

324
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,200
objective thought is still beyond the

325
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,440
grasp of our most complex machines

326
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,120
we can create a mode of music we can

327
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
compare our enjoyment of chocolate

328
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,000
we as humans have taste and art we can

329
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
have opinions about politics

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,360
we can feel things

331
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
and we also recognize that the value of

332
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
helping and we also recognize the value

333
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,120
of helping other people who are in need

334
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,780
i don't claim to have the definition

335
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,120
[Music]

336
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,560
to to answer this the the complete 100

337
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
gospel truth on this but maybe being

338
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,000
able to empathize

339
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,959
with and help another human is just a

340
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,560
small part of what makes

341
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,560
humans human in the same way that we

342
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
make these comparisons about our

343
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,800
intelligence

344
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,399
maybe we should be contrasting our

345
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,360
humanity with our technology

346
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,959
personally i think confucius got it

347
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
right when he said that vanilla

348
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
benevolence is the characteristic

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,440
element of humanity

350
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
almost every technology dreamt into

351
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,600
existence

352
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
comes at the promise to improve the

353
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,880
human condition

354
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,360
what the story of topsy shows us is that

355
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
there is the great and terrible

356
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,040
potential of our own invention

357
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,760
when it's paired with selfish interests

358
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,639
when this happens

359
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,240
a conflict of interest becomes

360
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
inevitable

361
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,079
innovation at its most noble is

362
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,839
inspiring it offers us

363
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,200
a vision for a brighter future

364
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,880
it offers us less human toil but there's

365
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,600
this other side of innovation the

366
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
business side that often works

367
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
against the greater interest of humanity

368
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,320
and it's driven by self-interest

369
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,160
in this paradigm decisions are made that

370
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,839
benefit the bottom line rather than

371
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,360
what's best for the people

372
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
the technology impacts these two

373
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,720
concepts

374
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
aren't always at odds with each other

375
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,399
but more often than not if there's a

376
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,800
conflict between these two

377
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,240
then the profit motive wins with respect

378
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,399
to the story about topsy we could

379
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,600
barely wonder if electricity for edison

380
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,240
was ultimately for the sake of humanity

381
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,519
or for the sake of the dollar

382
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,600
you see there's an invisible balance

383
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,440
between these two conventions that needs

384
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,279
to be maintained for a project to be

385
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:49,680
both

386
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
financially viable and ethical in our

387
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,000
modern age

388
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
not enough money and you risk not being

389
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,279
able to pay for your project or

390
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,079
even for your own survival not enough

391
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,760
ethics and you risk unleashing a

392
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,040
technology that

393
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,959
into the world that tears the fabric of

394
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,560
our society especially

395
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,920
when it's in the wrong hands

396
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,839
this balance between humanitarian

397
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,440
interest and profit is maintained

398
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,399
primarily

399
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
between three groups the dreamers

400
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,079
the investors and the scientists

401
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,040
one provides the idea or the vision one

402
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,399
provides the money

403
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
and the last provides the labor the

404
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,959
dreamers are the entrepreneurs they have

405
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,839
this idea

406
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,600
and it's great and it's going to change

407
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,839
the world and they're working to bring

408
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,279
that idea to fruition

409
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,639
they're responsible for building the

410
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,240
business and directing the development

411
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
of the idea

412
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,720
they're the boss some of you

413
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
watching may be members of this group

414
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
your job is to balance the interest of

415
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,920
your ideas

416
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,440
with the interest of the second group

417
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,279
the investors

418
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,639
i do not envy you the investor's

419
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,399
interest is in generating profit in the

420
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,560
form of monetary gains from the dreamers

421
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,440
idea

422
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,000
a dream may excite them and the its

423
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
implications for humanity may be kind of

424
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,120
like a positive

425
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,160
uh maybe a feel-good incentive

426
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,600
but wealth is really the ultimate goal

427
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,279
their responsibility is primarily

428
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,440
focused on the financial viability of

429
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
the project of the dream

430
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
but these three group these two groups

431
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
can't make the dream

432
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,560
reality alone they need a third group

433
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,040
they need the scientists

434
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
like myself many of you in the audience

435
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,600
probably fall into that last group

436
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,759
i work as part of team with other

437
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,079
scientists to bring a dream to life in

438
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,279
part

439
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,639
i have to adopt the dream of the company

440
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,440
and make it my own because most people

441
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
like to believe

442
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
in and what they they do work and so if

443
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,399
i don't believe in my dream if i don't

444
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,600
believe in the dream of the company

445
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,199
there's probably a good chance that i'm

446
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,360
not helping make it a reality

447
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,199
so the motivation of the scientists is

448
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,480
perhaps the most

449
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
complex of these three groups

450
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,519
money is obviously a strong motivator

451
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,120
for the scientists but it may not be the

452
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
only motivator

453
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,600
so often we do our own calculation

454
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,160
on that balance between the work that we

455
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,360
believe in and how much it pays to do it

456
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
we may take benefits into account when

457
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,279
we take a job how much money it's going

458
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,040
to put into my retirement account what's

459
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,079
the base pay

460
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,279
are there stock options involved etc

461
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,399
we as scientists become a microcosm of

462
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,839
the overall balance

463
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,880
in ethics versus profit companies know

464
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,320
this and they aim to sell their

465
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
positions through to us through a pitch

466
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,639
or an open job offer that involves good

467
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,199
pay

468
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,279
good benefits but also an important

469
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,519
mission

470
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,759
the success of any given technology

471
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,759
depends on the individual decision

472
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,040
making of the dreamers

473
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,880
and the investors and the collective

474
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,959
decision making of the scientists to

475
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,759
participate

476
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,639
in building a dream this is the silicon

477
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,800
valley agreement

478
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,720
these three groups then represent the

479
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
members of a fast-paced culture

480
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,119
that's kind of sprung up around silicon

481
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,000
valley

482
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,679
and the development of new technology

483
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
it's easy for ethical technology to get

484
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,599
lost in a culture that thrives on this

485
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,959
model of build fast

486
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,000
fail fast and rewards cutting costs and

487
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
money

488
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
when the car when when it comes to

489
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
investing time and energy

490
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,319
back into a product though sometimes the

491
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,799
dream

492
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,200
gets cut short in this rapid fire world

493
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,799
society ends up

494
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,559
getting the short end of the stick

495
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,880
when it comes to the ways that the tech

496
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,120
industry impacts humanity today

497
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
it's not only about the way that we as a

498
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,039
society use technology

499
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,440
but also the way our habits and quirks

500
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,320
find their way

501
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,799
into the technology that we build for

502
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,520
example

503
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,760
we've known about usability issues

504
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,240
around handedness for decades

505
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,160
in the middle ages left-handed people

506
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,919
were thought of as evil we called them

507
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,440
sinister and we treated them with

508
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,679
skepticism eventually

509
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,760
we came to realize that life for lefties

510
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,160
is just harder in a right-handed world

511
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,320
and so adaptive technologies were built

512
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,360
to accommodate this

513
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,240
underserved class of people this is why

514
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,600
we have left-handed scissors

515
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,720
makes sense right recognizing this

516
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,799
usability bias against lefties led to

517
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,320
the creation of a whole suite of

518
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,000
products designed to make life

519
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,160
easier for this one particular class of

520
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
people

521
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,760
that's one of the small ways that we've

522
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,000
adapted technology to meet humanity's

523
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,640
needs

524
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
without putting too much emphasis on the

525
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,360
financial viability of the idea

526
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,200
the problem was solved in the solution

527
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,600
has since became a facet of our culture

528
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
but what about biases that have a deeper

529
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,120
more long-term

530
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,039
impact on the quality of life for other

531
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,880
classes of people

532
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
what about some biases that people have

533
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
against different races

534
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,840
genders sexualities economic classes

535
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,799
in the early 1980s vehicle statistics

536
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,039
began to show concerning trend

537
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,799
while the data showed that more men

538
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,039
drove well the men drove more

539
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,039
more miles than women on average and

540
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,799
therefore died at a higher rate in

541
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,919
collisions

542
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,480
women were 17 percent more likely to be

543
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
killed in an accident while sitting in

544
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,960
the front seat

545
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,400
than a man at the same age

546
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,720
similar similarly any seatbelt wearing

547
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,559
female occupant of a

548
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,840
had a 73 percent greater chance of being

549
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
seriously injured in a frontal car crash

550
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,120
than a man

551
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,559
in the same kind of accident so

552
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,840
why the statistical variance it turns

553
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,120
out that life-saving technical

554
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,600
mitigations built into cars that protect

555
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,400
vehicle occupants were built were not

556
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,880
built

557
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,840
or tested for women's smaller on average

558
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,200
bodies

559
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
this was due to the fact that the auto

560
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,039
industry only used crash test dummies

561
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,400
that matched an adult an adult male

562
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,159
when the data began reflecting these

563
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,000
alarming statistics regulators

564
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
started to ask for crash testimonies to

565
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,520
be made to spec for an average adult

566
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
female

567
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,520
it would take another 20 years for a

568
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,360
crash test dummy to be built reflecting

569
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
a smaller human body

570
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,840
seemingly small oversights like this are

571
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,440
one way that tech development

572
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,000
and the industry around it failed humans

573
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,039
but not all

574
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,440
oversights are so innocent in nature

575
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,120
right now there are technologies being

576
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,720
pitched and sold

577
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
that claim that they're going to

578
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,000
revolutionize the way that we police our

579
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,440
communities

580
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,280
they claim to do this through predicting

581
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,559
who will commit crime

582
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,600
and where they do this through the use

583
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:43,919
of

584
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,720
myriad of indispensable data and live

585
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
sensors

586
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
the philosophy of course is that it's

587
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,799
harder to commit a crime when you know

588
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,120
you're being watched

589
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,360
over the past decade u.s municipalities

590
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,400
have been taking a

591
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,200
great deal of interest in these magical

592
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,360
solutions to crime

593
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
so why is this kind of text so bad then

594
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,400
if it can predict where crime is going

595
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,240
to happen why wouldn't you want to use

596
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,760
that knowledge to allocate police

597
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,840
resources accordingly

598
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,720
the devil's in the details these

599
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,919
technologies take in

600
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,480
broad regional criminal statistics and

601
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,400
analyze it to help local governments

602
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,799
make

603
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,280
conclusions on its face these

604
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,880
technologies have a lot of potential

605
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,760
monetary value to their investors

606
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,919
but who's really paying for it

607
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,559
here again is where our balance of money

608
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,480
and humanity is thrown into stark

609
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,640
contrast

610
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
data analysis is going to tell us where

611
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,039
crimes are happening but if we don't ask

612
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,760
why the crime is happening here we are

613
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,799
willfully ignoring the human half of the

614
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,640
problem

615
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,960
what these machine learning technologies

616
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,720
don't consider is the qualitative

617
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,760
reasons behind crime

618
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
the things that that caused the crime in

619
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,600
the first place

620
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,440
these types of technologies don't expose

621
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,520
the critical context of why the crime

622
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,039
might be high in one neighborhood

623
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,840
and low in another all that matters is

624
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
the conclusion

625
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,679
they say that past is prologue and

626
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,679
nowhere is that more true than when you

627
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,880
consider the effects

628
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,280
of endemic discrimination designed and

629
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,120
enforced by our own government and

630
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,480
economic system

631
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
to keep certain communities trapped in a

632
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,039
perpetual state of economic depression

633
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,600
in the 1930s the federal home loan bank

634
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,640
board the fhlbb

635
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,000
commissioned a company called the

636
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
homeowner's loan corporation

637
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,799
holc to draw up a map showing the

638
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,760
security

639
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,840
of financial investments made in certain

640
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,679
neighborhoods in certain cities

641
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,039
around the united states

642
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
on the left you can see one such map

643
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,840
that the holc

644
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,440
created this one is for the city of

645
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,000
baltimore

646
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,480
this map was then used to allocate real

647
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,159
estate investment from both private and

648
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,600
public sources but

649
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,240
there's only one small problem this map

650
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
was created based exclusively on

651
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
racial demographics the holc

652
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,360
then gave a rating to each neighborhood

653
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,440
a1 being the safest neighborhood to

654
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,320
invest in

655
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,799
or the whitest neighborhoods in the city

656
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,640
all the way down to d9 which reflected

657
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,159
the most insecure neighbors or the

658
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,760
neighborhoods with the highest density

659
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
of non-whites

660
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,840
for decades this map then dictated which

661
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
communities got financial investments

662
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,280
and which didn't

663
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
isn't the first step of abstracting

664
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
important social factors into the

665
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,799
fuzzier concept

666
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,159
of a neighborhood on the right you can

667
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,919
see these neighborhoods mapped to

668
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,320
a social vulnerability index where zero

669
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,679
green

670
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,840
is less vulnerable and one red is more

671
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,240
vulnerable

672
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,679
unsurprisingly most of the same

673
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,200
neighborhoods that were being invested

674
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,799
in the 1930s

675
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,880
rate lower on the social vulnerability

676
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
index today

677
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,880
this historic practice of limiting

678
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,159
investment on

679
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,120
to a certain group of people based on

680
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,320
where they lived became

681
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,158
part of what's referred to as redlining

682
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,240
if you'd like to know more here's a link

683
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,600
that will take you to the interactive

684
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,360
map that you just saw in the last

685
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
and last slide should help you digest

686
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,480
the data a little bit more

687
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,159
practices like redlining and jim crow

688
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,000
laws are etched into public policy

689
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,080
while the market adopted strategies like

690
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,880
racial steering and price discrimination

691
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,039
all of this was done for the purpose of

692
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,120
financial advantage based entirely on

693
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
skin color

694
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,559
these policies shaped neighborhoods they

695
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,360
created so-called sundown towns or all

696
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,279
white municipalities that insulated

697
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,200
communities by race and forced out

698
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,640
non-whites

699
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,120
holc's investment security map all but

700
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,000
ensured that

701
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,080
far fewer economic advantages would be

702
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,919
offered to one particular group of

703
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,360
people

704
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,679
with this history in mind it is is it

705
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,200
any wonder really

706
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,039
why crime statistics might reflect

707
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,559
higher in certain places and among

708
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,120
certain groups

709
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,480
time abstracts this history and it

710
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,360
re-contextualizes it in our current day

711
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,559
and age

712
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,799
our technology now seems to abstract

713
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,840
that history even

714
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,320
further when the dreamers and the

715
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,080
investors come with their ideas of a

716
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
better tomorrow

717
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,120
they often don't come with food printers

718
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,400
and flying cars

719
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,640
they're coming with pre-crime facial

720
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,679
recognition

721
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
robocops and surveillance drones

722
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,720
future generations are going to blame a

723
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
technology for these injustices instead

724
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,320
of the people who created it

725
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,159
instead of the original perpetrators of

726
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,679
the injustices in the first place

727
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,159
the good news is that in response to

728
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,080
activist warnings some communities are

729
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
now moving to preemptively ban

730
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
some of these technologies from public

731
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,480
use before they can be fully adopted

732
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,000
but that hasn't stopped the companies

733
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
from building a technology and taking it

734
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,039
to market anyway when we advocate for

735
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,720
technology that isn't capable of

736
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,480
considering the years of governmental

737
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,640
neglect and abuse that lead an area to

738
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
be economically depressed

739
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,360
and prone to crime for generations we

740
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
have to ask ourselves again

741
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,240
who benefits is this for the betterment

742
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,520
of mankind

743
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,879
or for the dollar

744
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,679
this legacy of corrupt technological

745
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,679
development necessitates that we have to

746
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,000
do

747
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,720
something about it today to respond to

748
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,559
the damage that the cycle has on

749
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,240
humanity

750
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,200
we are at a critical moment in history

751
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,279
we are training the first generation of

752
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,279
machines whose processing is going to be

753
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,440
used to replace our own decision making

754
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,760
on

755
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
social issues the choices that we make

756
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,200
today will have

757
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,360
impact for generations to come so

758
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
how do we make technology more ethical

759
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,600
then

760
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,120
one question that we could be asking of

761
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,039
our technology is is this

762
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,559
giving more to humanity than it's taking

763
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,480
not every idea is worth the investors

764
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,600
dollar

765
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,679
similarly not every idea is worth a

766
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,600
scientist labor hour

767
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,440
if you're a scientist like me you can

768
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,679
ask yourself is the project that you're

769
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,400
working on

770
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,480
a benefit to society do you feel good

771
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,000
about the idea and is the end result of

772
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
your work something that you'd be proud

773
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
to associate your name with

774
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
i know that i've had my fair share of

775
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
jobs where i wasn't sure that the answer

776
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,279
to those questions were yes

777
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,440
i was lucky enough to also be able to

778
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,600
disassociate myself from those prospects

779
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,720
before

780
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,520
i they got too bad and i was not

781
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,000
comfortable

782
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
with them our economic system then

783
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,279
incentivizes us to care less about the

784
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,399
job and more about

785
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,520
the money that the job pays it

786
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,440
encourages us to hold our noses and do

787
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,880
work that we might object to

788
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
if money is not part of the equation

789
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,000
one of my favorite technological

790
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
visionaries sci-fi author

791
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,799
philip k dick said this the true measure

792
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,919
of a man is not

793
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,120
his intelligence or how high he rises

794
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,159
in this freak establishment

795
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,840
you know the true measure of a man is

796
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,440
this how quickly

797
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,760
he can respond to the needs of others

798
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,520
and how much of himself

799
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,360
he can give we need to get away from

800
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,840
this idea that chasing paper is this one

801
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,039
and only true virtue that exists

802
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,440
the amount of dollars one has does not

803
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,919
on its own approximate intelligence

804
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,679
and it also doesn't prove the strength

805
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,840
of one's

806
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,520
in american culture we often look at the

807
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
richest people and aspire to have their

808
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
level of wealth

809
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,799
we equate their wealth with their

810
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,960
intelligence and we see ourselves using

811
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,520
our own

812
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
smarts to attain that same level of

813
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,679
wealth you know we think

814
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,919
if we could just work hard enough we'd

815
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,919
have just as much money as they do we'd

816
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:48,880
be just as

817
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,720
righteous as they are we'd be just as

818
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,120
good

819
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,480
as they are but there's a side effect of

820
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,960
this thinking as well

821
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,399
but that same logic that says that we

822
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,240
can simply will our way out of a

823
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,200
financial

824
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,000
our current financial station in life we

825
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,919
wonder why others don't just

826
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,279
choose to do the same we cast blame on

827
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,000
those with less

828
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,799
than us for not having pulled themselves

829
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,600
up by their own bootstraps

830
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
ultimately we decide that if they're

831
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,960
poor

832
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,279
it's more or less because they choose to

833
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,120
be poor

834
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,440
it seems that same blind corner that

835
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
exists in technology

836
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,600
development also exists in our own

837
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
inherent perception of

838
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,879
human value itself

839
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,480
we need to disentangle our flawed

840
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,159
perception of human value from the

841
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,640
number on a bank statement

842
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,200
in this way we can begin to see how our

843
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,039
own choices impact others

844
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,720
we can start to build technologies that

845
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,960
serve mankind instead of an economic

846
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,600
system that encourages us to devalue our

847
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,000
human

848
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,200
wealth worth

849
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,799
if we want to see change in the

850
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,559
technology that we produce

851
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,520
we have to reassess the system of values

852
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,840
that we use as a basis for these

853
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,960
technologies if you're a dreamer with an

854
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,080
idea for technology

855
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,600
start thinking about the ways that your

856
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,279
technology helps people

857
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,240
that may never interact directly with it

858
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,360
start thinking about

859
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
the positive and negative ways that that

860
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,840
technology will impact those same people

861
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,039
the people who may never

862
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,080
touch it decide on a guiding principle

863
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,919
and resolve to never make a compromise

864
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,919
that might hurt society instead of help

865
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,720
it

866
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,240
if the technology that you're working on

867
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,159
already exists then there's

868
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,720
never a bad time to start thinking more

869
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,640
ethically

870
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
but also think about the cultures that

871
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,840
you build

872
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,760
try to empower your workers and free

873
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
them as much as possible

874
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,360
give them opportunities to speak openly

875
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,120
and don't punish them for being honest

876
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,480
with you

877
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,159
trust their judgment and listen to their

878
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,480
concerns don't just listen

879
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,440
but take them to heart often the

880
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,360
scientists have a deeper familiarity

881
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,120
with those blind ethical corners that i

882
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
was talking about than even the dreamers

883
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,640
do

884
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,720
how the dreamers react to the scientists

885
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,919
feedback makes

886
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,200
all the difference in the world both

887
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,720
dreamers and investors

888
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,640
can and should regularly consult with

889
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,399
ethics lawyers who can help guide the

890
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,080
conversation about the right way forward

891
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,440
with investment and development and

892
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,960
development

893
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,720
if the end goal really is to make the

894
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
world a better place then your actions

895
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,960
your actions should reflect that ethos

896
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,080
the good news is that we are not yet

897
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,840
condemned to a future

898
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,159
in a high-tech hellscape where blood

899
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,840
runs through the wires of our machines

900
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,760
instead of electrons

901
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,000
we can always atone our technological

902
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,159
sins and make something that gives to

903
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,840
humanity instead of takes away

904
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,880
in 1945 dr robert oppenheimer stood on a

905
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,720
parcel of land called the hornada del

906
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,440
muerto

907
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,559
or the route of the dead man who watched

908
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,880
the single largest man-made explosion in

909
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,640
history

910
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,480
the trinity test made way for one of the

911
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,039
most deadly technologies that humanity

912
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,080
ever created when we think of weapons of

913
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,519
mass destruction

914
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,360
most people think of this bomb

915
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,519
the explosion was so violent that it

916
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,120
caused him in that moment

917
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,159
to recall a famous passage from a story

918
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,360
called the bhagavad-gita

919
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,240
and he had to reflect on how this quote

920
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,720
now applied to himself

921
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,679
but a little over 60 years after the end

922
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,200
of the war of the currents

923
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,039
another milestone in electricity would

924
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,360
be reached

925
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,399
on december 20th 1951 ebr won the

926
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,240
world's first nuclear power reactor was

927
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,760
switched on

928
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,000
at first it only powered four light

929
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,120
bulbs

930
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,120
and then it powered the entire facility

931
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,200
technology has always been emblematic of

932
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,760
change and change is often perilous

933
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,159
we control our technology we determine

934
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,399
the course of our own history

935
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,720
we control the balance of the technology

936
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,679
that we produce

937
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,480
and we increasingly are using those

938
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
technologies to observe

939
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,080
analyze and control the world around us

940
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,039
we are hopelessly intertwined with our

941
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,320
own technology

942
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,360
whether it's a nuclear plant or one of

943
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,600
our prehistoric ancestors using a tool

944
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,120
for the first time

945
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,360
our technology is definitive of our

946
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,799
human existence

947
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,000
on this planet it's up to us to make our

948
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,799
technologies

949
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,240
work in our own best interest not just

950
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,120
for the survival of ourselves but for

951
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,919
the survival of the species

952
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,080
and so in closing i'd like to refer to

953
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,240
the words of another great contributor

954
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,279
to atomic science

955
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,200
you cannot hope to build a better world

956
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,440
without improving the individuals

957
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,000
to that end each of us must work for his

958
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,120
own improvement

959
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,120
and at the same time share general

960
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,919
responsibility for all humanity

961
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,840
thank you

962
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,239
i cannot think of a better way to

963
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,119
in the day that was absolutely wonderful

964
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,960
the the history the cadence

965
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,719
it was just it was really excellent

966
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,000
okay i was worried i was worried i

967
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,760
sounded too much like i was reading from

968
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,199
a paper because i was no it was very

969
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,560
it it was it was an excellent um

970
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,639
it was an excellent tone especially it's

971
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,599
the the

972
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,719
keynote appreciation it was

973
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,440
really interesting really well said

974
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
good good thank you for the thanks for

975
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
the positive feedback

976
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,800
yeah perry you had commented earlier

977
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,159
that's where i was trying to tease where

978
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,599
you said somebody had noted that it

979
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,119
seems like there was a theme to this

980
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,480
conference

981
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,560
and there was that was me who made that

982
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,520
comment

983
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,000
yeah so as the organizer and the head of

984
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,680
the cfp committee

985
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,960
one of the things i really wanted to

986
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,079
push that would be a little different

987
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,119
this time

988
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,880
was while there was certainly a lot of

989
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,560
tech there was a constant theme

990
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,320
throughout most of the presentations and

991
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,640
particularly with the opening keynotes

992
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,960
all the way to the closing keynote about

993
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,400
humanity

994
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,520
and i think that's something that we

995
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,880
also forget a phrase that i often say

996
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,960
is that we have too many nerd solutions

997
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,200
for nerd problems

998
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,520
the end of the day users are people

999
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,760
behind those computers are people

1000
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,520
and what i liked about what emily did is

1001
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,599
we took the compassion

1002
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,280
that was seen in multiple talks from

1003
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,119
that initial keynote

1004
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,960
took it to more of a systemic level of

1005
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,280
looking at it on this macro scale

1006
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,800
of what is our role in that level with

1007
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,520
humanity and industry and systems

1008
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,880
so i thought that was incredibly well

1009
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,480
done very poignant very insightful

1010
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,640
thank you i'm glad i i'm glad i have my

1011
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,560
hard work paid off it was

1012
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,000
it was a late night last night

1013
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,440
was there was there any feedback in the

1014
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,760
chat

1015
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,200
or that one a lot in chat

1016
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,640
so um in uh yeah in discord there's a

1017
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,920
ton on chat right now you're getting a

1018
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,880
bunch of

1019
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,880
uh kudos okay great

1020
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,200
people are sad about the elephant poor

1021
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,160
top i know

1022
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,359
it's sad it's such a sad story i was

1023
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,079
when i was like

1024
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,680
up really late last night and my body

1025
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,119
hasn't adjusted to the the time

1026
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,599
difference so i was like

1027
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,200
pepsi 11 o'clock last night

1028
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,560
sad i mean it's sort of

1029
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,800
i guess one of the questions i had in my

1030
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,920
head as i was listening to your

1031
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
presentation was

1032
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,400
you know do you have specific

1033
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
technologies that you feel

1034
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
have just crossed all of your lines like

1035
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,280
are you like er bitcoin or or some like

1036
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,960
nfts or whatever

1037
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,119
yeah no i could like i could definitely

1038
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,960
go on the warpath the problem is that

1039
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,000
like a lot of these companies

1040
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,240
are also really litigious so i don't

1041
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,920
want to like call out anyone by name

1042
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,359
because

1043
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,440
their their business model is kind of in

1044
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,960
that that sell out

1045
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,400
of the human spirit and if you say that

1046
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,640
overtly then they like tend not to like

1047
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,839
that so

1048
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,480
um i i think that everyone this is this

1049
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,599
is the great thing about a talk like

1050
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,280
this is like i don't feel like i have to

1051
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,560
say any of those names

1052
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,240
out loud because everybody has a sense

1053
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,560
for who those people are right like

1054
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,680
it's not as if people take a job

1055
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,200
at a specific company and then they're

1056
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,280
like oh well this is great like i'm i'm

1057
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,680
really

1058
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,160
i feel great about this this job and

1059
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,079
it's it's definitely

1060
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,440
satisfying this need that i have uh to

1061
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,400
be productive

1062
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,119
and and help people like everyone wants

1063
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,400
to help people

1064
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,040
but from the outside looking in i think

1065
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,560
a lot of people get that sense about

1066
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,320
some companies like it's just not

1067
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,280
that's not what they're doing there do

1068
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,480
you feel like there's

1069
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,960
there's counter examples of that where

1070
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,720
there's companies you feel really are

1071
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,240
making a difference for humanity that

1072
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,760
you've noticed

1073
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,320
yeah well most of those companies um in

1074
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,000
the technologies that they build tend to

1075
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,040
be

1076
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,839
um tend to be things that are done in

1077
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,280
retrospect like

1078
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,960
um like google had some issues recently

1079
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,240
in the last few years where they were

1080
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,520
training

1081
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,800
excuse me they were training machine

1082
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,119
learning algorithm to like

1083
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,920
identify faces and it ended up being

1084
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,320
that

1085
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,880
um the the algorithms were trained to

1086
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,680
identify

1087
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,079
like uh an african-american's face as a

1088
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,680
gorilla and this was like

1089
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
not a great thing it's a really bad

1090
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,720
thing so

1091
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,480
they ended up just like nuking the

1092
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
entire training algorithm that they were

1093
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,200
using

1094
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,680
um so like there there are ways to make

1095
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,400
good choices about these technologies

1096
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,640
um but the the problem that i see is

1097
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,520
that it happens

1098
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
in retrospect way too much it's always

1099
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
like a like a second thought like

1100
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,599
they open the pandora's box and then

1101
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,599
they realize like oh like we

1102
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,040
we just did something that we had no

1103
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
intention of doing and now this is

1104
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
we gotta like put that genie back in the

1105
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,720
bottle it's it's not a great

1106
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,959
way to mitigate those problems

1107
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,680
in the same way that security is often

1108
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,440
applied as a band-aid rather than as

1109
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,040
something built in from the

1110
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,520
from the start yeah there's a lot of

1111
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,880
there's a lot of rhymes

1112
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,680
in in infosec and this talk i just gave

1113
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,279
so i hope that people picked up on those

1114
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,560
cool i'm i did not know bryson if you

1115
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,599
wanted to do

1116
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,760
a a full-on announcement of the

1117
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,960
different

1118
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,800
meets that are happening because

1119
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,160
yeah we talked about earlier but some

1120
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,079
people might not have heard it

1121
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,040
yeah um so emily again thank you so much

1122
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,440
um

1123
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,119
i know when we first started talking

1124
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,640
about this a while ago you were a little

1125
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,760
nervous

1126
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,119
and it was definitely a hard

1127
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,240
topic right these the reality

1128
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,680
is we're not going to just throw a few

1129
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,960
more lines of code and solve these

1130
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,880
problems we really need to acknowledge

1131
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,440
some of the darkness that's there and i

1132
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,200
think that was absolutely appropriate

1133
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,040
so i appreciate you being so brave to do

1134
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,720
that yeah thanks for giving me the

1135
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,560
opportunity it was a challenge

1136
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,599
okay so um emily's gonna be over

1137
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,680
on discord for those of you who would

1138
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,680
like to talk to her in person

1139
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,079

thanks everyone here uh posted the

1147
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,880
discord link in

1148
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,640
there you go discord link for those who

1149
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,079
haven't seen it at this point

1150
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,599
um uh

1151
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,040
thank you to dave and perry for

1152
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,079
staying with me all day and making

1153
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,359
me look smart um second

1154
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,440
uh thank you to all of the coaches the

1155
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,280
speakers and the volunteers and

1156
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,720
all of the grim staff that helped make

1157
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,880
this possible uh this is the

1158
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,720
fourth one that we did we started this

1159
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,319
back at the beginning of

1160
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,400
the pandemic when everything just

1161
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,480
stopped i mean there were no conferences

1162
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,760
everybody just killed everything and we

1163
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,560
were like well

1164
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,280
we we should leap into that and i feel

1165
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,839
like we've

1166
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,760
found a way to bring a different voice

1167
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,680
by really trying to bring so many

1168
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,000
different voices in a different tone the

1169
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,800
next one

1170
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,200
uh will be in july so we're continuing

1171
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,640
to try to put these

1172
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,359
uh in the dead spots in the calendar um

1173
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,119
so that there's always content here for

1174
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,480
you being generated and of course if you

1175
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
can't make it during the day

1176
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,359
we will record everything and put it up

1177
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,280
on the grim youtube for you

1178
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
uh it usually takes a few weeks after a

1179
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,319
conference so

1180
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,359
be patient with us um

1181
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,359
we have happy hours starting here take

1182
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,560
your time they're not going to start

1183
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,079
right at 6 30 everybody will just sort

1184
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:00,560
