00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,279
hello grimcon and welcome to what to

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,160
expect when you're expecting a pen test

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,160
this presentation consists of tips

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,320
pitfalls and successful strategies from

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,320
my experiences both in my years as a

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,239
penetration tester and a consumer of

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,840
tests that can help your engagements to

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,960
run smoothly

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,400
and deliver greater return on your

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,240
investment of time and effort

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,519
it is geared toward anyone who is

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,599
looking to get a test completed

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,119
or anyone who has an imminent test

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,359
coming up now this is a large subject

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,000
and we could spend

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,320
hours getting into fine detail however i

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,399
believe this high level introduction

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,920
will serve to start you down the road to

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,840
better overall experiences with test

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,480
engagements

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,360
first a bit more about myself i've been

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,000
a penetration

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,440
testing consultant for the past eight

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,600
years performing tests for federal state

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
and local governments as well as private

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,039
customers covering traditional and

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,559
cloud-based deployments

28
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,559
prior to being a penetration tester i

29
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,399
have experience as a consumer of

30
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,000
penetration tests during my time as an

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,239
information systems security officer

32
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,520
and development experience as a

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
front-end web developer i view my

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,199
current job as using my

35
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,119
expertise to provide as much useful and

36
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,960
actionable information to my customers

37
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,799
as possible within the testing time

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,760
frame

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,520
outside of testing and writing reports

40
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,520
i'm a dad a maker and have been a

41
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
volunteer for b-sides dc since the

42
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,000
beginning

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,680
including being co-director for five

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
years my contact information is on this

45
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
slide and will be shown again at the end

46
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,439
of the presentation for anyone that has

47
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,320
further questions

48
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,280
so on to our agenda for today first

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,960
we're going to talk about types of tests

50
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,640
just to set the stage

51
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,479
then we'll talk about strategies for

52
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,280
pre-testing during the test

53
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
post testing and then some takeaways at

54
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,280
the end to sum everything up

55
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,159
so first let's set the stage i think of

56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,399
this as our you are here map

57
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,079
we're progressing from the least

58
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,159
intrusive to the most intrusive

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,759
at the bottom or the most complex at the

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,520
bottom now there is a lot of

61
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,399
disagreement

62
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,399
in the field as to where these

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,640
categories start and end so

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,119
buyer beware there is many types of

65
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,960
tests as there are testing companies

66
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
so you can but you can generally group

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,080
them into

68
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
some categories to make some separations

69
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,239
between what you might get

70
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,319
with different types of tests although

71
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,080
always ask questions of the testing

72
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,760
company or companies that you may be

73
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
considering working with

74
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
to understand where they fall on this

75
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
spectrum

76
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,840
starting off first we have a

77
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
vulnerability scan this is more of a

78
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,959
basic review

79
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,239
with automated tools frequently and

80
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,560
usually does not attempt to exploit or

81
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,319
verify any of the vulnerabilities that

82
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,760
are seen it's just going to give you a

83
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,680
report of here is what we see when we

84
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
take a look at it from the outside

85
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,319
again this may be there may be a slight

86
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,599
difference here of

87
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,239
verification of vulnerabilities with

88
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:50,959
different

89
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,280
test shops moving on to a penetration

90
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,879
test this is the one this is what i've

91
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,040
performed most often in my career this

92
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,280
is

93
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,959
usually an announced test so everybody

94
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,800
knows it's going to happen no surprises

95
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
are trying to hide

96
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
it does attempt to exploit it exploit

97
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
any issues found and verify any

98
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,319
any um possible methods of getting in

99
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,720
and may also go further into the lateral

100
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,080
movement and

101
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,920
searching for valuable information and

102
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
even exfiltration of information

103
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,159
depending on what you're looking for

104
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
then we have kind of like an offshoot

105
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,480
here that applies to penetration tests

106
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,519
red teams

107
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,239
and even purple teams a targeted test

108
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,319
what this really just means is you're

109
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,159
specifying a very specific

110
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,440
scope for your testing so

111
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
for example we have a new web

112
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
application that we're going to be

113
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,640
releasing we want to have a very

114
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
thorough review or we're deploying a new

115
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,200
physical

116
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,879
part of our network our new physical

117
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,239
system that's

118
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,840
adding on and we want to have some

119
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,159
clarity as to if that's ready for prime

120
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,200
time

121
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,799
then moving on to another level of

122
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,400
complexity we have a red team

123
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,720
this frequently means force on force so

124
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,519
you're actually

125
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,519
exercising your incident response or

126
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
incident prevention capabilities

127
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
there is a much more open scope timeline

128
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,319
or both to these frequently

129
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,439
red team tests can run for from weeks to

130
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,120
months to years

131
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,320
the testing team can leave behind leave

132
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,880
behind back doors and things to

133
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,199
facilitate getting back in and

134
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,320
frequently

135
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
this is exercising an ir capability also

136
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,759
many

137
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,840
much less people know on the

138
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,680
organization on your side how

139
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,120
who what will be

140
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,919
if the test is being performed this is

141
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,280
much more labor intensive and

142
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
needs much more in-depth planning and

143
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
support most of the strategies we're

144
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
talking about today will be on the

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
penetration test vulnerability scan side

146
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,040
but i'm just putting this out here so

147
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,199
you can have that knowledge of what's in

148
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,400
the future

149
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
and then purple teams those are kind of

150
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
like a red team but more collaborative a

151
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,960
collaborative

152
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
red team so it's an effort between the

153
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
attackers and your defenders

154
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,639
to understand and iterate more quickly

155
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,120
through

156
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,759
we see this okay here's how you fix or

157
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,560
detect that

158
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,080
and then moving forward and and fixing

159
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,639
as you go

160
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
so now that we've set the stage for uh

161
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
testing

162
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,199
we're moving into pre-test pretest is

163
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,880
where everything starts

164
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,440
just like security overall is better

165
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
baked in than bolted on

166
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,320
the more you can define what you're

167
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
looking for and what concerns you have

168
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
before you start the test in this stage

169
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,720
the better you are

170
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
it's always a bummer when you're when

171
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
you've made some assumptions and not

172
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,320
really ask the questions

173
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,240
and the team hasn't really answered your

174
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
questions

175
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
before the test and we get to an impasse

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
or something that stops testing when the

177
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,160
tester

178
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,039
when the team is on site that at that

179
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:49,440
point

180
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,360
you're now costing money and time and

181
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
that as

182
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
as somebody who has had tests i would

183
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,919
want my test team

184
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,280
functioning and actually uh and actually

185
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
working while they're on site because

186
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,319
i'm paying them you know per diem on

187
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,000
site time and things like that so i want

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,199
to maximize

189
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,080
what happens when they're in the room

190
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,880
versus

191
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
and spending a little bit more time in

192
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,919
pre can help me with that

193
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,680
so first understand your why is it why

194
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
are we having a test

195
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
do we want information do we just want

196
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680
like a a picture of how we're doing

197
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,000
are we trying to satisfy a compliance

198
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
needs for example pci

199
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
hipaa or a financial requirement where's

200
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,919
the test required for legal reasons i

201
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
i have personally have performed tests

202
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,039
that have been ordered from

203
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,000
one agency to another uh as a result of

204
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
a breach or a result of another issue

205
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
they want to have clarity

206
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,080
on what's going on in that that

207
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
environment

208
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
after you've decided why or you have a

209
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
clear idea of why we're having a test

210
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,880
then we can figure out what

211
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,039
we want out of the test you know again

212
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,639
are we looking for information are we

213
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,919
trying to

214
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
generate some motivation for a part of

215
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,400
the organization are we trying to gain

216
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,280
ammunition

217
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,960
with the c-suite to move things or

218
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,199
to get them to give us funding and time

219
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,199
to do things that are important to us

220
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,720
from a security standpoint that we know

221
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,520
we need to do

222
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,120
but we just may not have been

223
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,960
organizationally allowed to do at this

224
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,080
point

225
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
or verification as i said before

226
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,599
verification that a new product or

227
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
service or area of the network is ready

228
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
for prime time

229
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,120
and then finally and then another thing

230
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,639
to consider once we've considered our

231
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,599
what is how

232
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,199
are we going to implement what we get

233
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,720
out of this test

234
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,560
are we planning to have some time for

235
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,479
our it staff to

236
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,960
remediate any issues found make any

237
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,120
updates make any recommended changes

238
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,360
for an improved security state at the

239
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
end

240
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,319
so then also during this process you

241
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,840
should take the opportunity to try to

242
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,599
get to know the team that you're working

243
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,000
with

244
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,599
and this is important because there are

245
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,639
a lot of different uh

246
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,960
personalities of penetration testing

247
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
teams some are more aggressive

248
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,280
some are more collaborative some are you

249
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,639
know at different areas

250
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,280
of maturity and of course different

251
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
areas of cost

252
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,199
cost is definitely a consideration here

253
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,479
but as you

254
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,599
you know as you talk to the team

255
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
understand what you're comfortable with

256
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,440
and if you're not comfortable maybe move

257
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,879
to a different team there are definitely

258
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,720
lots of penetration testing shops out

259
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,599
there

260
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,479
so you know it's the it's the old adage

261
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:24,800
of

262
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
if something doesn't seem right maybe

263
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,199
it's a time to try something else

264
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,280
but once you've landed on a team that

265
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,399
you're comfortable with

266
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
ask the other questions how many testers

267
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
will be coming on site what will they

268
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
need when they get on site

269
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
and then what is the process how are

270
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,958
they going to do it have them walk you

271
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,919
through a high level

272
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,679
how is the test going to go what happens

273
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,519
first second third and then

274
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
the basic timelines for those obviously

275
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
things will change in practice

276
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
and then consider the sensitivities at

277
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
your site is it hard to get ports open

278
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,320
or is meeting space very difficult to

279
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,240
come by things like that

280
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,760
all of these can can be considerations

281
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,800
that

282
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,560
trip things up or make things more

283
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,880
difficult but if you consider them ahead

284
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,680
of time

285
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
it might smooth things along and have

286
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,920
things go more quickly

287
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
scope scope is the most important thing

288
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,880
to testers

289
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,680
for me the the thing that slows me down

290
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,040
as a tester and gives me the most

291
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
challenge is when

292
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,279
the scope of the network or or these

293
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,680
the uh provided documentation is unclear

294
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,959
or incorrect so definitely take the time

295
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:33,680
to provide

296
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,080
to gather and collect those ip ranges

297
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
network diagrams are great

298
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
but we really want to understand how big

299
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,279
is the haystack that we're looking

300
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,800
through and

301
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,680
that allows us to figure out one how

302
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,640
many people we need

303
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
and how quickly we need to move once we

304
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,920
get on site

305
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,120
and i know it can be difficult to get a

306
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
a full inventory of your in of your

307
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
infrastructure

308
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,519
some places are very large and things

309
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,160
move quickly some places are smaller and

310
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,640
have

311
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
a little bit more static setup so that

312
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,959
can be an advantage

313
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,079
either way but do your best to get that

314
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,240
map set out and try to keep that over

315
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,200
time

316
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,880
it's kind of a knowing what you need to

317
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
defend is also useful from a

318
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
from a blue team or from your from your

319
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
business side as well

320
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
and also try to understand or try to

321
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,959
collect

322
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,360
a list of things that are concerning for

323
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,880
you or fragile an example would be

324
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,360
during a test we have been told not to

325
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
target a system during business hours

326
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
because it's either critical for the

327
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,880
operation of the business or it was a

328
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,920
part of the

329
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,320
hours tracking or pay system so we were

330
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,040
able to

331
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,000
adjust our timing as to when we were

332
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360
going to test that system

333
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,120
in order to um in order to just

334
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,839
limit the impact to day-to-day business

335
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,320
so that's an example of

336
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,240
going that extra level from your

337
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,560
inventory to understanding

338
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
endpoints and understanding what they do

339
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,760
so we can

340
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,320
make a we can develop a plan that

341
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
maintains the safety of that asset

342
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,200
but also gets a comprehensive test and

343
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
then the final thing that

344
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
we like to that i like to ask for in my

345
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
pre-scoping is

346
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,440
for your oh no moments or your crown

347
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,399
jewels

348
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,800
these are the things that if it was

349
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,680
taken out of

350
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,240
taken out of your control or if the data

351
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,200
was stolen

352
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,920
or if the system was taken offline or if

353
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
the data was altered would be an oh no

354
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,959
moment if this would be

355
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,880
an existential threat to your business

356
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,800
model so

357
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
the reason that we want to know this is

358
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
not so that we can get the easy button

359
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,079
and go straight to it and say haha

360
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,640
that's we we found your crown jewels and

361
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,760
here they are

362
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,880
it's so that we can develop in our

363
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,680
out brief and in our reports a story of

364
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,120
all of the different

365
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,440
possible avenues of attack to get to

366
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
those and then help you to shut those

367
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,200
down as quickly as possible

368
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,839
during the test moving on to during the

369
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,040
test so we've done all of our

370
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,399
questioning we've asked

371
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,399
we've asked our questions and we know

372
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,920
our test team and we're ready for them

373
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,279
to be on site we know how many people

374
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,560
are coming we've got the conference room

375
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,079
ready to go we've got the network drops

376
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,000
set up

377
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,240
then the pentest team comes on site sets

378
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
up and starts their scans

379
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,120
now remember most penetration tests

380
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,680
are not trying to hide from you we have

381
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,399
a limited

382
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,079
amount of time to provide as much

383
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,760
information as possible

384
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,839
very commonly for me it's one week so

385
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,200
really four days

386
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
we have some setup time at the beginning

387
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,079
we have some tear down time at the end

388
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:42,480
which

389
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,519
which truncates our time frame even more

390
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,839
i like to joke that uh we're the bright

391
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,800
pink dump truck

392
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,639
on fire coming in through the front door

393
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,959
we make a lot of noise

394
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,000
because we're moving very quickly but

395
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,639
that said the first thing we want to do

396
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,760
is try to

397
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,480
avoid the blame game now the most

398
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,680
important part i think

399
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,480
of of the blame game and i don't love

400
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
the word blame

401
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,279
but is the internal side on the

402
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,800
customer's side

403
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,519
people get anxious when the pen testers

404
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,320
come in

405
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
i've definitely seen it at at every type

406
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:19,440
of

407
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,040
every type of business that i've gone

408
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,720
into people think they're going to get

409
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,160
in trouble they're going to get fired

410
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,519
things like that

411
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,600
so the one thing i would say here is do

412
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,959
what you can

413
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,360
to emphasize that this is an information

414
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
gathering this is so that you can use

415
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
a a niche area of expertise

416
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
to gain further information about your

417
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
network and your business

418
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
that will hopefully improve the way that

419
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,079
you do everything

420
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,880
and try not to point fingers one thing

421
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,120
that i say about all of the tests is

422
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,279
anyone can be gotten you know anyone can

423
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,600
be fished anyone can have their machine

424
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,399
exploited in some way shape or form and

425
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,920
frequently especially when we start

426
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,680
moving into lateral movement

427
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,480
we're not um we're not targeting anybody

428
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
specifically and it's not really

429
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,959
anyone's specific

430
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,720
fault that something happened but

431
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,399
i also definitely have seen people

432
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,639
tighten up in meetings when people

433
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,120
when management asks the question well

434
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,800
whose machine was this

435
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,480
so it's something to to keep in mind

436
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,360
and it's human nature to to want to to

437
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,079
view this as a test and sometimes it is

438
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,360
but do what you can to lower that uh

439
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,480
that fear with your team and then also

440
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,399
on the penetration testers side they can

441
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,800
tell you what they're testing

442
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,639
in early in the early part it'll be a

443
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,240
wide net that they're casting across

444
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
your entire ip range or your entire

445
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,199
network range

446
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,279
but as the test goes on everything it

447
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,519
narrows down more and more and more

448
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,680
so if there's something that is it seems

449
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,600
strange go and ask the testers

450
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,760
hey we're seeing some strange activity

451
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
on this one ip address or on this one

452
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,800
server name or

453
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
our endpoint name is that something that

454
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,240
you guys are testing

455
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
if it is we can certainly pause the test

456
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
i've done that many times we've

457
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,720
we've stopped scanning we've stopped pen

458
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,320
testing we've stopped

459
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
all stop on that ip address moved on to

460
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,240
other things and continued being

461
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,040
productive

462
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,680
while the customer can triage and and

463
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,639
return it to

464
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,000
a state that they're happy with so

465
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,160
you know but that communication with

466
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,279
your testers you know keep the

467
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,959
communications flowing the test is a

468
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,199
relationship keep asking questions if

469
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,120
you see stuff that is concerning you

470
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,279
or activities that are concerning you

471
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,959
run them by your testing be open with

472
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,040
them and say hey this concerns us

473
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,959
and then the tester should be willing to

474
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,720
work with you to to come up with a

475
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,959
solution to get the test done but also

476
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,600
not

477
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,320
impact your business and then finally

478
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,639
consider how you're going to deal with

479
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,000
critical issues this doesn't mean you

480
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,560
have to have

481
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,519
like a step one step two step three plan

482
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,320
but

483
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,720
haven't have an idea in mind like if

484
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,639
something critical comes up how who is

485
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,279
going to

486
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,519
who's going to to you know quarterback

487
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,279
the effort to deal with it

488
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,320
and how are we going to expect to have

489
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,720
to

490
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,480
to potentially have to give time to one

491
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,079
of our staff to to fix

492
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,320
any issues that come up because it's

493
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,440
common when we

494
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
find a critical issue that involved that

495
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
gives access to a system

496
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,560
that we will we as a testing team will

497
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,279
exploit the system access the system and

498
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,800
then

499
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,880
we're good to go at that point we have

500
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,399
our access that we need and then we'll

501
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,240
let the customer know and say hey we

502
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,680
think you should patch this

503
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,160
before we even go any further we think

504
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,519
this is something that you should

505
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,199
give attention to right now and at least

506
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,440
give that opportunity to our customers

507
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,199
so that they can

508
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,000
they can consider that and decide

509
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
whether or not they

510
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,000
they agree and that is again totally up

511
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,240
to you

512
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,279
okay so the test is completed

513
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,759
testers are packing up their equipment

514
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,519
there's no more activity going on on

515
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,959
your network everyone is breathing a bit

516
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,000
of a sigh of relief because

517
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,959
everything is done well at least the

518
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,959
testing the active portion of the test

519
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,319
is completed

520
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,559
so now what should you get from your

521
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,359
test team

522
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,599
they have something to deliver to you

523
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,000
one of my my co-workers likes to say we

524
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,520
we pen test for free and we write the

525
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,359
reports for our pay

526
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,480
so there are several types of

527
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,079
output that you can expect to get from

528
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,720
your penetration testing team

529
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
first and foremost the one that will

530
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
probably happen first is an out

531
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,640
brief and out briefs come in many sizes

532
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,520
and flavors

533
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,760
so there's there's the general outbrief

534
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,919
which is a high level overview

535
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,960
testers will go over you know basic

536
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,679
findings

537
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
um things that they're going to put in

538
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,600
their report general observations maybe

539
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
some

540
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,039
some high level recommendations again

541
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,400
this is something

542
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
that you should have discussed in the uh

543
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,760
that you could have discussed in the pre

544
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,880
pre uh pre pre-test planning

545
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,320
is how how technical is your report

546
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,840
can you show us an example but

547
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,679
for the general outbrief it will be high

548
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,960
level things

549
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,799
the important thing about the overall

550
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,160
outbrief is this gives you a chance to

551
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
get your decision makers in the room

552
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
again going back to what we talked about

553
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
in pre-planning

554
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,559
if you're looking to get some

555
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,720
information or ammunition with your

556
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,840
management levels

557
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,640
to to drive some change to say hey we

558
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,480
really need to change this policy across

559
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,360
the network

560
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,760
or hey we really need to to improve our

561
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,120
system patching

562
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,520
uh system passing patching process or

563
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,880
hey we really need to

564
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,760
to uh decommission that really old piece

565
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,120
of equipment that we're not actually

566
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
using and is kind of a hole in our

567
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,760
network

568
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
if you're trying to deliver that kind of

569
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
message the outbrief allows you to let

570
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,400
the testers deliver it for you

571
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,039
i've definitely been in out briefs where

572
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,080
the customer

573
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,880
wanted to to to make a point or

574
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,400
something and they had a hard time

575
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,960
getting

576
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,840
the information or the message to stick

577
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,320
from

578
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,280
an internal perspective and assessors we

579
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,080
were glad

580
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,960
to provide a to provide backup to

581
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,840
provide support

582
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
yes we see this too and we think it also

583
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,200
needs to be fixed

584
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,000
and for some reason the third party

585
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,679
perspective

586
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,760
makes that message land much better

587
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,160
another type of useful format outside of

588
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,919
the just the general outbrief

589
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
is the tech focused or the tech to tech

590
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,280
outbrief

591
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,000
this one is much more informal and i

592
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,919
believe it should be

593
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,799
what generally happens with these is the

594
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,880
test team maybe not all of it maybe the

595
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,919
people who found

596
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,000
most of the issues or who are who are

597
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
the most up to date on everything

598
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,240
or it could be the entire testing team

599
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,559
and whatever it staff wants to come in

600
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,880
so this could be you know firewall admin

601
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,280
server admins it depends on how varied

602
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,080
and how large

603
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,120
your particular staff is i've had

604
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,440
tech focused briefs that were 30 people

605
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
i've had tech focus briefs that were

606
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,880
five of us

607
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,520
but it's really an information sharing

608
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,400
situation

609
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,200
it's um it's tech guys talking tech

610
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,320
uh and the advantage here is that when

611
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,039
that

612
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,919
report comes out a month later the it

613
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,520
staff will have already had a direct

614
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
conversation about what was in the

615
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,880
report and when they

616
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,320
and they can also ask questions

617
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,159
clarifying questions to get

618
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,240
further detail it's that's specific to

619
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,159
your environment

620
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,960
and when they get the report two months

621
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
later or a month later however long it

622
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,320
is they can say oh right i had that

623
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,159
conversation with the with that one

624
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,440
tester um

625
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,679
uh matt was his name yeah and he he

626
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,440
explained that to me and i i know what

627
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,400
i'm doing i know how to fix that

628
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
so it can be a really useful knowledge

629
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
sharing exercise

630
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,280
and something that you can request from

631
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,400
your team you know hey i'd really like

632
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,320
to have a 30 minute or 45 minute

633
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
discussion between rit staff and your

634
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,679
testers when we're getting close to the

635
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,159
end

636
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,480
just to review everything and get a

637
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,600
clear idea

638
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
and you can cover so much more talking

639
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,880
back and forth and

640
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,360
then is able to be conveyed in even the

641
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,919
best

642
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,799
best written report i'm talking about

643
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,679
the written report

644
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,679
the the report is an output it's

645
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,200
definitely something that's useful

646
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,520
uh something to to file if you have a

647
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,720
again if you have a compliance

648
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,919
requirement we need to

649
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,240
to have proof of the report it's also

650
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,200
something that

651
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,640
can be reviewed year over year so again

652
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,080
if you're looking for ammunition for

653
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
more funding driving home a point to

654
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,720
leadership

655
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
you can request more information in the

656
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,640
executive summary part or

657
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,200
or more pointed recommendations there if

658
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,480
you're wanting to ensure your technical

659
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
team has a very clear readout you can

660
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,880
ask for

661
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,120
further information about how issues can

662
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,919
be fixed

663
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,240
and how how the recommendations are

664
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,760
going to be communicated in what level

665
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,679
of detail

666
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,520
definitely you can ask for an example

667
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,840
report can you show us

668
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,919
an example of what type of reports you

669
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,679
provide

670
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,280
and another thing to know at this point

671
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,559
is is can you reach out for

672
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,000
clarification if you get the report and

673
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,880
you have a question

674
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,240
or if if if somebody just didn't take a

675
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,200
note on something and they want to know

676
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
every outbrief that i have been in the

677
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,120
final slide is

678
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,600
here's our contact information please

679
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
feel free to reach out to us and

680
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,400
amazingly it happens very rarely but i

681
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
would be glad to go through any

682
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
any item in any of one of my reports and

683
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,400
clarify it or answer questions about it

684
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,280
if somebody had them

685
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,840
further after the test always ask more

686
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
questions always be asking questions

687
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,640
clarify things uh you know don't leave

688
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,360
things to

689
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,039
to chance if you

690
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,120
so once issues come out and almost every

691
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,200
test will find something

692
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,400
major or minor who is going to fix

693
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,880
who's going to perform the fixes is this

694
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,640
something that you're allowing time for

695
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
within your it staff

696
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
post test you know itsaps have a lot to

697
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:01,919
do

698
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,960
uh they're usually staffed right to what

699
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,679
you need or

700
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,000
usually less if you if you ask the i.t

701
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
staff you know we know

702
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,360
i know that i.t staffs are very busy

703
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,240
they have a lot to do

704
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,280
and so you'll need to consider do i need

705
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,679
to

706
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,280
to put some build some time in

707
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,919
afterwards to make the fixes

708
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,520
will another third party be involved you

709
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,440
have a contractor who who might be

710
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,240
helping you

711
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,280
assisting um will the testing team be

712
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,880
helping with some remediation

713
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
remediation efforts none of the teams

714
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
that i've been involved in have that but

715
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
it's possible that your test provider

716
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,720
has

717
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
a service to do that type of work and

718
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
then work on prioritizing so you're

719
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,400
going to get

720
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,679
a list of findings or or issues or

721
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,440
opportunities for improvement depending

722
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,960
on what they're called

723
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
and they'll be usually categorized by

724
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
critical high

725
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,919
medium low prioritize those and not just

726
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,360
necessarily by the

727
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,320
by the criticality rating prioritize

728
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,760
them by how easy they are to fix if

729
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,120
there's a couple that if there's three

730
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,400
or four of them that are easy to knock

731
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,159
off in an afternoon or in a couple of

732
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,679
days

733
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,080
do those first check a few things off

734
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,679
it's great and that gives you time while

735
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,120
those things are being checked off

736
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,080
to have the meetings for for the more

737
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,600
intrusive changes that are going to

738
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,000
require

739
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,320
testing and maybe a roll out to a subset

740
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,520
of machines

741
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,279
to determine um to determine

742
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,679
if if the change has taken and if it

743
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,640
hasn't

744
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
to ensure that it hasn't caused any

745
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,760
negative effects

746
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,279
but um you know as those com complex

747
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:35,919
issues

748
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,480
are decided and mapped out if you've

749
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,159
taken a little bit of time

750
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,919
in the pre-planning stages to consider

751
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
this as we talked about before and then

752
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,279
now we're taking the time in the post

753
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,480
stages to actually

754
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,320
put that into action we can

755
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
hopefully smooth out the process of

756
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
fixing what needs to be fixed

757
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,279
improving the business and moving

758
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
forward

759
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,760
so our takeaways pen tests seem scary

760
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,360
but i promise they don't have to be

761
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,400
planning ahead asking the questions

762
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,240
making sure that you have clarity on

763
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,760
everything and not taking anything for

764
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,640
granted can definitely smooth it along

765
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,559
again before know why you're having the

766
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,640
test know what you're hoping to get out

767
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,799
of the test and drive toward that

768
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,480
that can help you make those decisions

769
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,840
during the process of hey

770
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
we don't need to follow this this down

771
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,279
the path because that's not the type of

772
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,120
information i'm looking for or

773
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,960
yes that test is something that i want

774
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
to pursue until the end

775
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,799
and then how you're going to implement

776
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,320
what comes out of it

777
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,720
again i know now i know why i'm doing it

778
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,159
i know what i want and i know

779
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,960
what i'm hoping to do afterwards ask the

780
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
questions before you make sure the

781
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
testing team is on the same wavelength

782
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,720
as what you are they're

783
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,799
they're on the same page they're doing

784
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,679
the test the way you want it done

785
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,159
um determine your scope try to get as

786
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,679
good of an inventory as you can

787
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,200
including the devices that you're

788
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
concerned about the

789
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,960
the oh no moments the the crown jewels

790
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,840
the things that

791
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840
that are the most important to your

792
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,880
business

793
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,000
during the test try to allay the fears

794
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,960
of your staff

795
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,360
try to try to make things as comfortable

796
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,039
as possible the more

797
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,360
collaborative and communicative you can

798
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,279
be during the test the better things go

799
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,159
in my experience

800
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
and then plan your responses to anything

801
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,000
critical that comes up again if

802
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,360
if you have a good relationship with

803
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
your testing team those those moments

804
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,120
will go much smoother as well

805
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,039
and then after the test again keep

806
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,200
asking questions clarify things that you

807
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,159
need

808
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,840
communicate what you need from the test

809
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
team and they should be providing it to

810
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,640
you we

811
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,799
i as a tester and providing a service to

812
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,159
you trying to get you what you need

813
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,840
use the outbreaks to your advantage get

814
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,440
those decision makers in the room if

815
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,400
they need to hear

816
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,640
what's coming out of the testers and

817
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,159
then get the tech team

818
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,120
directly in contact with the testers to

819
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,640
talk nerd to each other

820
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,279
it helps it really does and then reach

821
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,880
out after the test if necessary take

822
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,799
advantage of that every team says hey

823
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,039
we're here for any questions

824
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,799
so use them for sure you know don't

825
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,640
don't think that you're you're

826
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,320
taking advantage you've paid for a

827
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
service and that is part of the service

828
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,480
is making sure that report

829
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,919
is to your liking or not necessarily to

830
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,240
your liking but to your satisfaction

831
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,159
you have gotten the information you need

832
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,760
it might not be the information you like

833
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,080
but it's the information you need

834
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,120
and you know i as a tester that's where

835
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,799
i know i've done my job i've delivered a

836
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,559
report to the customer and they say yes

837
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,640
this is clear i know what to do with it

838
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,080
and i know and i appreciate the clarity

839
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,720
and detail of the information provided

840
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,320
also other resources i know that tim

841
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,399
medine from red siege on their siegecast

842
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
is doing a pen test process

843
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,559
presentation over three weeks i believe

844
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,080
is what it is and it will be

845
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,760
on their siegecast and on youtube you

846
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,600
