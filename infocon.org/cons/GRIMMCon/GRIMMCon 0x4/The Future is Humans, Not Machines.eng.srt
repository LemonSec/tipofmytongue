78
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,599
pretty

79
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,040
pretty easy to find me um before we go

80
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,680
all the way

81
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,120
kind of down the rabbit hole i want to

82
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,440
give a little bit of background

83
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,959
on what this talk is um

84
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,760
in the end my goal isn't to tell you

85
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
what you should think

86
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,599
it's to explain to you how i came to the

87
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,200
conclusion i came to

88
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,239
um and hopefully get you thinking about

89
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,760
how you think about this right

90
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
is the future of information security

91
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,599
humans or is it tools and machines and

92
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,560
new technologies

93
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,200
um and i think we know my stance on it

94
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,599
but

95
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,519
again i'd love to hear yours and really

96
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,879
what i want to take you

97
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,640
through is how i came to my conclusion

98
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,319
um like i said and i really want to

99
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,920
kind of emphasize that because if at

100
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,560
times the the process seems disjointed

101
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,080
my slides seemed disjointed

102
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,599
you know you asked dan how did you get

103
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,519
from there to there um it's just how my

104
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,319
mind works

105
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,840
right and i'm showing you that thought

106
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,400
process and hopefully in doing so

107
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
again i'm getting you to think i'm

108
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,599
getting you to have these discussions in

109
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,000
this

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,519
this discourse so i want to start at the

111
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:33,920
end

112
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,319
i want to start at the conclusion right

113
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,400
i think it's a little bit more nuanced

114
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,959
than humans are the answer right i'm not

115
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,120
saying machines aren't the answer

116
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,959
my conclusion what i came to through

117
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,640
this process through this journey of

118
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
thinking about this

119
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
is that machines and new technologies

120
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,959
are important

121
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
but at the end of the day an appropriate

122
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,159
quantity

123
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,319
and quality of human beings are required

124
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,239
to have adequate cyber security

125
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
i don't think that's crazy it's it's

126
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,000
pretty pragmatic it's um it makes sense

127
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,799
i think

128
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,760
um to me right again let me know um and

129
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,879
you'll see there

130
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,120
this was said by me today at this at

131
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,840
this conference

132
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,079
so let's go back to the beginning we

133
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,358
start we started at the end

134
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,560
let's go back to the beginning and

135
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,880
i know we have these conversations daily

136
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
um i've seen them on twitter i've seen

137
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,199
them on linkedin

138
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,919
i've seen them in discord groups um i've

139
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,000
i've had them with colleagues back when

140
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,680
we could be around the water cooler

141
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,759
um but you know you might be saying dan

142
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,880
we're at a conference

143
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,160
how did you end up going down this

144
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
rabbit hole and like all good things

145
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,479
um it started with an argument so it

146
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,680
wasn't really an argument it was a

147
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,720
lively discussion

148
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,560
um between myself and a good friend of

149
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
mine um the type of friend

150
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,960
that you meet in the industry in your

151
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,639
career paths kind of split

152
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,880
um but you respect each other a ton and

153
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
you stay in touch and you know your

154
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,639
friends

155
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,240
it's not just the working relationship

156
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,919
you text each other constantly

157
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,639
um so so i guess i'm giving that

158
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,600
background because this is a friend

159
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,199
who's in the industry it's a it's a

160
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,919
friend

161
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,199
um who i talk to about this stuff a lot

162
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,000
right

163
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
and he got a new job working for a

164
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
pretty cool company it sounded like and

165
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,280
i'm not doing advertisements for anyone

166
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
here so i'm not going to name the

167
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,919
company but

168
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,880
it seems like they're doing some pretty

169
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,199
cool things they're a startup um he's

170
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,120
kind of like a

171
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,600
lead architect senior architect

172
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
solutions architect right so he's kind

173
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,960
of on the sales engineering sales

174
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,639
architecture side of things

175
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
and um as most things go i coming from

176
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
the practitioner side of things i get

177
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,360
very

178
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
skeptical and i ask a lot of questions

179
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,639
about about the solution

180
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,080
so he said to me he's like look

181
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,360
eventually this conversation came to a

182
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,800
place where he said look

183
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,160
the problem isn't the amount of people

184
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,759
or the quality of people the quantity

185
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,880
and quality right

186
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
he's like it's the tools the tools suck

187
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,919
we don't have enough data

188
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,000
we need more tools more more widgets

189
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
more boxes with blinky lights and i said

190
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,639
i hear you um but

191
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,160
i think it's actually the other way

192
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,080
around i think it's it's people like

193
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
we have tons of good tools we have a lot

194
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,440
of good stuff but

195
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
we need we need the people and he came

196
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,319
back and he said yeah yeah i hear you

197
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,319
uh but it's the tools and you know he

198
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,600
gave his reasons and i came back and

199
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:13,919
said

200
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,759
oh i hear you um and but it's people

201
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,039
and it kind of reminds me of this uh gif

202
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,840
here from uh shit's creek you know it's

203
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
tort it's a cake it's a tour it's a cake

204
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,199
the conversation just kind of went like

205
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:27,600
that

206
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,199
for for way too long so i started

207
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,240
uh on self-reflection and this is what i

208
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,759
mean about non-sequiturs and like dan

209
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,880
how did you get there

210
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,360
so i started down this path of like okay

211
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,479
maybe i'm wrong

212
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,080
right maybe it maybe it isn't people

213
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
maybe it is nuanced maybe

214
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
it's not um maybe it is tools maybe we

215
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,000
just need more tools we need ai we need

216
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,360
machine learning we need

217
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
uh neural nets and quantum computing

218
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,800
like that's that's all stuff we need

219
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,840
that's going to take care of all the

220
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
problems in security

221
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,160
and so what i often do is i think

222
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,280
historically

223
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,120
and i i like to think historically and i

224
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
like to think outside of the context of

225
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
the industry i'm in

226
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,919
and um i came to textiles

227
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,120
and it's weird right

228
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
how did you get to textiles if you look

229
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,440
at the colorized photo on the right

230
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,599
it's a city a small city in

231
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,800
massachusetts

232
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,360
called fall river fall river is where i

233
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,960
was born and grew up

234
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,039
and fall river more recently

235
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,919
is not known for great things uh high

236
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,039
crime rates

237
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,080
not best schools um

238
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
an ex-mayor who's been indicted by the

239
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,120
federal government

240
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,039
um that you know that type of thing not

241
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,400
great

242
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
press um more classically or

243
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
historically

244
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,759
uh fallout is known for for two major

245
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,639
things um

246
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,039
one is the lizzie borden murders so i

247
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,000
guess the city kind of started

248
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,039
off their kind of history of bad news

249
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,800
early um if you don't know about those

250
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,479
murders uh pretty gruesome stuff

251
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,680
definitely you know go check it out

252
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,879
there's been documentaries and movies

253
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,400
made on it it's pretty interesting to

254
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,240
live in a city where you kind of have

255
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,080
um that kind of grim

256
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
uh tourism aspect to it no pun intended

257
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,560
i know it's grim con

258
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
and then the other thing is textiles

259
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,479
right which is weird so

260
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,919
fall river um

261
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,440
was the leading textile manufacturer in

262
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,000
america

263
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,560
for a period of time um and and they

264
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
also at one point in time were the

265
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
second largest textile manufacturer

266
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
on the planet um and and textiles

267
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,320
actually continue to run

268
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
through um the blood and fall river a

269
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,200
little bit in that

270
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,958
it's not the major industry but there's

271
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,399
still a lot of things like

272
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,000
leading yarn dying companies in fall

273
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
river just found that out today actually

274
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,320
um you know people bring their alpaca

275
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
wool to fall river

276
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
um and that type of thing but what

277
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,720
happened is back

278
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,839
in the early days um

279
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,440
right around kind of the founding and

280
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
early days of fall river becoming this

281
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
textile manufacturing

282
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
hub um the first automatic bob and

283
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,959
changing weaving loom is introduced

284
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,120
right and this this was like a huge

285
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,320
automation change

286
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
in in the textile industry and it set

287
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,839
off at

288
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
actually a century of kind of innovation

289
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,279
in the textile industry

290
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,760
um but there was this weird timing where

291
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,720
this came out

292
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,399
fall river was moving into this textile

293
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,760
industry and

294
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
it exploded this tiny little city in

295
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,839
massachusetts we went to the world stage

296
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,120
and was the second largest textile

297
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
manufacturer for a period of

298
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,560
you know about 30 or 40 years

299
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,080
and the reason i came to this is i was

300
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
thinking about how much automation

301
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,279
changed that industry

302
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,600
and how this these new tools these

303
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,080
automatic bobbin changing weaving looms

304
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,880
uh allowed for this this explosion right

305
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,200
and

306
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,959
i was like okay yeah machines machines

307
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,320
um and then i was like okay i'm going to

308
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,680
be talking about this at a conference

309
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,959
and everyone's going to be

310
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,360
really confused at this juncture and be

311
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,399
asking like how

312
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,560
again dan why textiles so i thought

313
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
about transportation right this is an

314
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,440
easy one horses were the primary

315
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
mode of transportation in the early

316
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,680
1900s it continued to be common horse

317
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,640
and buggy type thing all the way up

318
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
until about the 40s

319
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,959
[Music]

320
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,880
but it really started to be phased out

321
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
and replaced with cars

322
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
when the model t was introduced so again

323
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
just a more i guess a more common or

324
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,519
more easy to connect

325
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,160
um me thinking about how machines have

326
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,120
have changed

327
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,839
things right and innovated outside of

328
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,519
the information security industry more

329
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,279
kind of historical context

330
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
type things right and we can look at a

331
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,399
thousand things in the industrial

332
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,600
revolution these are just kind of the

333
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,240
two my brain went to

334
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
but then i started thinking even more

335
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
and i was like hey that's not the whole

336
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,440
story around either of those things so

337
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,839
you know fall river it wasn't just these

338
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,959
automatic looms um

339
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,440
fall river's on harbor it's on it's on

340
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,640
the taunton river

341
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,560
um which is actually uh basically

342
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
it's basically the mount hope bay if

343
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,920
you're familiar with kind of

344
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,160
the geography of newport rhode island

345
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,360
and the mount hope bay and it kind of

346
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
feeds all into that river so

347
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
they had a harbor they had the ability

348
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,399
to get these textiles on boats

349
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,720
up the river um and out and when i say a

350
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,600
river i mean like

351
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
not your little river it's a big river

352
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
you can go across a pretty long bridge

353
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,720
to get

354
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,040
across this river and at the same time

355
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,399
they had this massive influx of

356
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,760
immigrants

357
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
so they had people who could run these

358
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
machines service these machines

359
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
and really you know make these machines

360
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,680
as effective as possible so

361
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
so okay now we're coming back towards

362
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
dan's humans theory right

363
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,560
humans are important you know fall river

364
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
didn't become a textile

365
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
juggernaut just because of automation

366
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
yeah the tools were great and new

367
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,279
but it required kind of process

368
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,120
and it required people and then i

369
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,560
thought about the model t

370
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,200
you know it wasn't the first car um it

371
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,760
was

372
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,560
just the first car that was easy to sell

373
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,000
to the middle class

374
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,440
and it was easy to sell to the middle

375
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
class because of the cost

376
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
and they got the cost of the car down

377
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,120
through kind of stealing from the meat

378
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,240
packing industry

379
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
the um the assembly line right people

380
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,480
always think uh henry ford model t

381
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,959
invented the assembly line um that's not

382
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,399
true he actually kind of

383
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,000
stole uh that the concept and used it

384
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
in a new way so we went from having each

385
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,959
car really hand built hand fitted to

386
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,560
this assembly line process drove the

387
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,200
price down

388
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,680
allowed for adoption um and you know by

389
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,959
the 1920s

390
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,639
uh just as an example of an industry

391
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,480
that was massively changed

392
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
um by the 1920s the us postal service

393
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,920
had the um

394
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,760
most cars under ownership in the country

395
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,040
right so they replaced the

396
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,839
the horse and buggy the horse and wagon

397
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,360
with these cars and motorcycles and

398
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,000
other things

399
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,160
but again it took people it took process

400
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,399
along with this new technology

401
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,519
to really drive things along

402
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,639
and so now we get to we take this leap

403
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,839
right so now my brain's

404
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,480
looking at textiles it's looking at cars

405
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
and it's saying like oh man i've seen

406
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
a slide about this a thousand times and

407
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
i'm sure you have two in a sales

408
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,880
conversation

409
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
about security topics um you see this

410
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
this beautiful synergy kind of thing

411
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560
and it's like hey we have people process

412
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,240
and technology right like

413
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,760
that's the those are the three things

414
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,240
when they work together you're secure

415
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,320
and i was like yeah i mean i when i was

416
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,760
a solutions engineer i actually had a

417
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,880
slide like this

418
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,399
you know we're offering managed

419
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
vulnerability management right

420
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
um and we would always say look our

421
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,519
people do the scans we have the

422
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,279
processes in place and we have the best

423
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,480
technology around

424
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,600
um and that synergistic approach is is

425
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,399
kind of

426
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,519
what what works and um i think that's

427
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,200
what those historical

428
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,880
things were saying and it's really you

429
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
know it's cheesy

430
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,880
but i always laugh i love silicon valley

431
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
and i love the conjoined triangles of

432
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,440
success

433
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,079
and i always laughed at the scenes

434
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,040
around this

435
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,440
um because it's funny because it's true

436
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
right there's there's these

437
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,600
synergy these people process technology

438
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,279
the conjoined triangles of success

439
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,959
they're silly kind of management

440
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,800
salesies speak

441
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,839
but they're true right and when things

442
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,800
are true they're

443
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
pretty funny um so

444
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
that was me thinking about the past and

445
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,880
then i thought about the present i

446
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
thought about my time

447
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,720
leading information security departments

448
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,240
i thought about my time

449
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,440
selling uh services and technologies

450
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,199
and i was like we have tons of

451
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,959
kind of instances of this today right

452
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,560
where the tool promises to fix

453
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,279
everything

454
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,360
but in the end there's a people process

455
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,959
kind of gap there

456
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,680
so you know let me know if any of this

457
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,040
sounds familiar to you

458
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
um these are just a few off the top of

459
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,720
my head but

460
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
hey this new expensive tool gives us all

461
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,320
the data in the world we could ever need

462
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,079
we'll never need any other data we have

463
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,399
full visibility single pane of glass

464
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,720
perfect beautiful um but we need to hire

465
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
three new people to run it and we're not

466
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
going to get cleared for that so

467
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,560
um let's buy it because we'll eventually

468
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,480
hire those people right but now

469
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,000
you're missing the people you have this

470
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,199
tool and you're missing people in

471
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,160
process happens

472
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
all the time um hey this widget can

473
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,199
block any attack

474
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,480
until it can't you know there's going to

475
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,560
be zero days and and things and our

476
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
machine learning is not 100

477
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,079
it's got to be you know it's going to be

478
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,120
a little loose so

479
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,320
you know you're going to have to do some

480
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
custom tuning when you when you get the

481
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,399
tool

482
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,160
in your environment okay that's more

483
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,680
people time more process you know

484
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,040
are your people you know being used at

485
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,560
100 capacity

486
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,240
in my experience in most information

487
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
security cyber security teams yes

488
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,680
110 120 capacity right

489
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
hey our box can stop any malicious

490
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,199
insider in their tracks but you're going

491
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:33,680
to need

492
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
80 professional services hours to stand

493
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,199
it up it's just complicated it'll go way

494
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,880
smoother for you let's get our ps team

495
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,440
involved

496
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,199
right um it's funny saying that as a

497
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,720
manager of professional services

498
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,040
uh but at cobalt we don't stand anything

499
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,240
up right it's

500
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
we add value through consulting so it's

501
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,759
a little bit different but

502
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
i've had i've had those instances where

503
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,480
i've been a solutions engineer

504
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,399
building out a poc for a customer and

505
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,920
their environment's so complicated it's

506
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,120
like hey this will work

507
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,839
but we we recommend engineering time

508
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,279
right

509
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,600
this is a more a more common one that

510
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,399
i've seen too

511
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,079
right hey all of our tools they can talk

512
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,079
to each other we're gonna be able to

513
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,199
orchestrate um or automate my

514
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,639
brain want to say both words at once

515
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,040
there um your mundane security tasks

516
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,880
but you know it really comes down to do

517
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
you have someone on staff that

518
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,000
understands how

519
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,839
to write these kind of api integrations

520
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
between your tools um

521
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,880
and the answer is sometimes yes

522
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
sometimes it's no sometimes professional

523
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,639
services gets involved again or whatever

524
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,839
the case may be right

525
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,800
um or and this is kind of a cheeky thing

526
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
for me because i used to

527
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,199
um sell sim and kind of sim as a service

528
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:39,680
or

529
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,720
soft as a service um all of the above of

530
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
these apply if you're buying a sim right

531
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,759
it's it's

532
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,680
you need fts to run it you need to tune

533
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,720
it you're going to probably need

534
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,160
professional service to set it up and

535
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,959
you're going to need someone to write

536
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,040
your api integrations so

537
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,880
sim is the worst best thing ever um

538
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,279
and so once i kind of looked at the

539
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,560
present and saw

540
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,800
the new tools and how they were still

541
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
processing people gap i started looking

542
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
forward right so i had just looked

543
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,559
historically at things outside of our

544
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,199
industry

545
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
i looked at what's going on today in in

546
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,959
our current industry

547
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,280
and i started to look forward and and

548
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,799
you know it's clear we have problems

549
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,240
today and

550
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
i don't think anyone would deny that and

551
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,559
how we solve those you know it's

552
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,559
vendors want to solve it with technology

553
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,679
and a lot of

554
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,119
you know in my experience people want to

555
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,280
solve it with people um

556
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,039
and they're these pains are felt in

557
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,400
different ways depending on the size of

558
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
the organization right

559
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
if you're in a small organization you

560
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,960
feel like you don't have enough of

561
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,799
either you don't have enough tools to do

562
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,760
your job and you don't have enough

563
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,400
people

564
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,880
you know if you start becoming like a

565
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,039
medium-sized organization who is

566
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,360
you know a semi-large organization you

567
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,640
know you may be feeling it a little bit

568
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,200
differently

569
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
you you have the budget you're buying

570
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
the tools but now you really need people

571
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,559
um or the other way around right

572
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,840
you really have the people but now they

573
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,440
need more tools and then when you're an

574
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,960
enterprise there's just this complexity

575
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,600
at scale

576
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,640
that that happens right and so

577
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,160
while i think these things are going to

578
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,679
continue to persist for some time i do

579
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,880
see a path

580
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
you know for change i think we we can

581
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,320
improve

582
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,240
a lot in these areas but i i don't

583
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,600
really think you came to this talk to

584
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,160
discuss

585
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,960
the path forward um like i said and my

586
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,480
intention wasn't to discuss a path

587
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,240
forward my intention was to

588
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,440
uh discuss how i came to this

589
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,679
this realization or this thesis that

590
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,880
humans are the future

591
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,679
um and really kick off a conversation um

592
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,240
among us

593
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
not not just about whether it's humans

594
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
or technology but maybe

595
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,559
let's let's use this as as a catalyst to

596
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,320
to talk about what that path forward is

597
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,000
as information security professionals

598
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,360
and leaders and in

599
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
people um within the industry but i'm

600
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,720
going to give you two people-centric

601
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,080
predictions for the future

602
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,280
um that that also came to me um

603
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
actually some time ago um i've held

604
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,520
these beliefs for a little bit

605
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,840
um and i felt like going through this

606
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,960
process they kind of

607
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,080
validated um my my kind of um

608
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,720
thesis or outcome so the first one is

609
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,840
that penetration testing is going to

610
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,799
replace scanning

611
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,919
um that's pretty bold hot tape

612
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,640
there dan you know spicy um i don't

613
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,360
think it is though

614
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,000
i i really don't i think that in my

615
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,280
experience

616
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,520
running not all scanners you still need

617
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,880
vulnerability scanners you know you

618
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,320
should still look for like open source

619
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
dependencies and i don't think it's

620
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,720
going to take care of

621
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,919
everything there's just some kind of

622
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,440
like low hanging fruit stuff you need to

623
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,080
do but like a dynamic scanner right

624
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,520
i've never gotten a ton of value out of

625
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
dynamic scanners um

626
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,880
the times i've gotten value out of

627
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,160
dynamic scanners is when i took the

628
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,520
dynamic scanning report

629
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,039
and used that as a tool to do my own

630
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,280
kind of internal pen test light

631
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,400
um that that's kind of like

632
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
where i've seen the most value otherwise

633
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,360
it just seems to be like noise and again

634
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,400
it takes some tuning

635
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,480
and you know it finds vulnerability but

636
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,919
really it's not a vulnerability

637
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,000
it can't be exploited or you know

638
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,280
there's some kind of business logic

639
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,200
there that that stops it that the

640
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
the scanner didn't detect or whatever

641
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,400
the case may be right and so

642
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,559
i think that was a there's two ways to

643
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,520
kind of

644
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,080
have pen testing replace scanning i

645
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,720
think one

646
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,520
is with a modern delivery model right i

647
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,320
think the

648
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,440
consultancy uh ramp up time

649
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,480
um you know type thing

650
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,039
is what keeps people from scheduling

651
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,600
more

652
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,240
um pen tests and this is a belief again

653
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,159
i i've held for a while and

654
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,760
it's why i joined the company i'm at now

655
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
this is by no means an ad for them

656
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,960
um it's just they do this right

657
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,799
um and so i think if you use an as a

658
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,080
service model

659
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,679
around kind of traditional professional

660
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,520
services you you can deliver at speed

661
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,400
and scale

662
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,320
right you just need to do things

663
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
differently you you need to treat

664
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,679
the people services like a technology

665
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,480
service right

666
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,159
you need to figure out ways to do things

667
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,520
that way so i think that's one way

668
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,080
right if you can schedule a pen test um

669
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,039
it costs

670
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,039
you know a reasonable amount of money uh

671
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,360
you can spin it up in 24 to 48 hours and

672
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,080
you can have

673
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,679
real results in real time as the pen

674
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,200
tester finds them

675
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,960
and get a report at the end like that's

676
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,320
awesome if you're doing

677
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,120
scans quarterly um you know a quarterly

678
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,480
pen test

679
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,919
likely works out better right but again

680
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,120
it has to be affordable it has to be

681
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,840
fast

682
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
um for that to work and then the the

683
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,880
other one is i'm seeing a lot of

684
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,080
companies invest

685
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,159
in internal resources i call them

686
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,159
offensive security resources because

687
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,919
i see companies invest in different ways

688
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,440
actual you know red teams

689
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,960
pen testing pools um offensive security

690
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,559
um in the banking industry they're you

691
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,840
know they're called all kinds of

692
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
different things you know global

693
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,320
security

694
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,360
uh you know whatever so like

695
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,480
they have different names so i'm just

696
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,080
saying people with those particular

697
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,640
skills

698
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,960
to actually go and pen test and have

699
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,559
offensive capabilities against their own

700
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,520
organization

701
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,799
and the reason i think about this is

702
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,799
like what i just said the only time i've

703
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,480
ever gotten value out of scans is i did

704
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,039
a scan

705
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,520
and then i manually touched stuff and

706
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,200
validated and tried to break things and

707
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,559
that's where i got the most value out of

708
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,360
scans

709
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,280
and so you know automated tools are

710
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,640
great

711
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,320
they're part of the process right but a

712
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,919
skilled human allows you to get more

713
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,320
coverage and greater accuracy so that's

714
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
that was one the other one is i think

715
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,000
that red teaming is going to replace

716
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
penetration testing

717
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
uh i don't think that one's so hot of a

718
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,760
take um if penetration testing is moving

719
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,600
upstream and kind of replacing scanning

720
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,039
then why wouldn't

721
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,120
kind of red teaming replace penetration

722
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,960
testing and i have a few thoughts about

723
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,600
this

724
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,120
one is the tooling's getting better you

725
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
have companies uh like i rate scythe

726
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,600
very highly

727
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,559
that have attack emulation platforms so

728
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,840
you can kind of have

729
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,240
your teams using this third-party tool

730
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,880
similar to

731
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,720
similar to using a third-party scanner

732
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,400
um and kind of running these

733
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,159
these attack emulations and getting a

734
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,640
report and being able to

735
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,919
show that um you know when you have your

736
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,960
traditional consultancies and

737
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,640
professional services like scythe even

738
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,000
has professional services

739
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
um around running these emulations right

740
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,120
and the

741
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,480
the reason i say this is penetration

742
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,080
testing when i talk to customers it's

743
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,720
very

744
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
compliance driven right but with

745
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,799
advanced attacks becoming more normal

746
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,159
it's only a matter of time

747
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,159
before we kind of raise the stakes raise

748
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,440
the bar um

749
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,640
you see it all the time in third-party

750
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,919
vendor management the questions are only

751
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,520
getting harder if they're only expecting

752
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,400
more um so customers and regulatory

753
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,039
bodies

754
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,640
are just going to keep raising that bar

755
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,400
and i think at some point soon

756
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,039
you're going to see them say do you have

757
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,960
reasonable assurance that you can defend

758
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,200
defend against an advanced attack right

759
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
um small companies can't afford this so

760
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,720
they'll have to rely on these specialty

761
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,440
shops and

762
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
in vendors um with with kind of tools

763
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,840
plus professional services to deliver

764
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,039
this for them

765
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,640
um and then larger companies who have

766
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,240
their own internal teams to do this type

767
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,880
of thing

768
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,559
you know i think eventually again

769
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,000
they're going to be driven to give a

770
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
third-party

771
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,039
validation for compliance purposes okay

772
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,240
that's cool

773
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
company xyz that you have an internal

774
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,600
team that runs this stuff on a regular

775
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,320
basis

776
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,400
um that's similar to scanning or doing

777
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,919
your own pen testing we need a third

778
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,360
party validation to make sure you're not

779
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,559
hiding anything right trying to be

780
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,679
sneaky about it

781
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,840
so those are two people-centric things i

782
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
see starting to happen

783
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,080
um and i see the industry continuing to

784
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,840
drive that way

785
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,720
um and so with that we kind of started

786
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
at the end

787
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
went through why i started thinking

788
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
about this we covered my thought process

789
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,679
which included textiles for some reason

790
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,600
um we and then we came to kind of this

791
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,880
future state of

792
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,799
of you know pen testing replacing

793
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,320
scanning and red teaming

794
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,919
replacing pen testing and there's a lot

795
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,520
of i have a lot of other opinions but i

796
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,760
only have 30 minutes to talk about them

797
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,720
so after this whole self-reflection i

798
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
came to the conclusion that i started

799
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,720
with

800
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
right right and it's that humans are the

801
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,039
future not machines i think that

802
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,840
machines and tooling will always be

803
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,880
important um

804
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,279
but you need effective people right you

805
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,400
need quantity

806
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,039
and quality people to run these tools

807
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,200
right and i think about it all the time

808
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,480
the tool that humans use are important

809
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
but if it's an unused or ineffective

810
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,159
tool then it helps no one

811
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,279
right um if you have an axe but you need

812
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,240
to you know

813
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
i don't know scoop water or carry water

814
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,799
around the axe is an ineffective tool

815
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,279
um and so again i just want to reiterate

816
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,960
that machines and new technologies are

817
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,760
important but

818
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,360
at the end of the day an appropriate

819
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,200
quantity and quality of human beings are

820
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,840
required

821
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
to have adequate cyber security so i

822
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,960
hope this

823
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,440
sparks a little bit of conversation get

824
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,400
gets you thinking

825
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,000
maybe you can go down your own road i'd

826
