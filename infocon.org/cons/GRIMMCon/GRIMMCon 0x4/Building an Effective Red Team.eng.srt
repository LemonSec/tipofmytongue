23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,359
building

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,080
effective red team functions as an

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,720
internal

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,360
corporate security red teams here in

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,240
2021

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,720
so a little bit of background uh

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,080
information on myself

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
i'm currently the red team lead at

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,159
twilio and personally

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,640
i enjoy kind of two areas that i like to

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,479
to play with in my personal time

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,600
i enjoy mac os post exploitation and

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
infrastructure automation so usually if

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
i have free time on weekends and i have

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
side projects i'm

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,560
usually building something in one of

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
those two buckets

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
um i'm blessed to be a husband and

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,000
father to wonderful wife and

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,320
kids and currently reside here in austin

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,600
though i'm actually

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,119
from all of us in the family are from

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,640
the east coast we've been here for about

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
three and a half years

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,000
uh the photo here is actually from the

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
highest what i believe

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,960
is the highest point in austin mount

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,479
venell um

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,600
so pretty cool area um did a good hiking

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,960
there with kids

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,079
um but prior to red team i used to

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
actually be blue team and that's sort of

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
where in the intel community

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,639
i fell into being like a packet analyst

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,000
all the way over through

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,720
internet response in the private sector

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,280
and

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
for me something that wilking really

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
spoke on about

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
empathy that's sort of why i have a

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,640
heart for blue teams and

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,920
because i've actually worked the role

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,360
and i understand the challenges

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
associated with

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
uh blue teaming effectively today um but

68
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,080
i really

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
really do enjoy collaborating with blue

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,840
teams um

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
with purple team exercises and just

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,319
helping uplift overall overall

73
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
detection and response posture this

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,120
here this time here twilio this is

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,879
actually my second time building out a

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,440
corporate red team function in both

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,239
instances

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,000
i was able to be the first basically i

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
was the first person i was a one-person

80
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,640
red team show

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
sort of with the open question of hey

82
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,879
like what what is a red team

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,200
what does it do should we invest in it

84
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,000
etc

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,239
and uh in both instances i was able to

86
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,680
grow the team with additional head

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
counter resources

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
so i hope that some of the things i've

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,879
learned along the way will actually be

90
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,480
of help or benefit to those who are

91
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
looking to do similar things

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,599
um i'm also a fan of 80s and early 90s

93
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,879
uh the music the food the movies

94
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
all that stuff is good with us me and my

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,920
wife we just

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,760
kind of love uh looking back at

97
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
nostalgic stuff

98
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
so um it's a good chance you may see

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
some memes pop up

100
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
that um reflect those decades throughout

101
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,200
my presentation

102
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
and i am on twitter at uh stead owens so

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,080
occasionally i'll post things from time

104
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,879
to time there that may be of interest

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,840
so agenda i plan to talk through from my

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,680
perspective what the state of the union

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,519
is right now in terms of like a shift

108
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,159
towards

109
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,519
internal red teams uh at corporations

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,440
some ground level foundational things to

111
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,280
think about as like if you're going to

112
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,959
build out a red team program

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
some general guidelines and approaches

114
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,560
that you can use some pretty practical

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,439
approaches around

116
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,239
running red team exercises some things

117
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,920
around some considerations around your

118
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,840
road map how important the roadmap is

119
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,879
how to plan it

120
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,000
workflow your workflow around that

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,840
some meaningful metrics and lessons

122
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,239
learned

123
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,238
so let's jump into the state of the

124
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,600
union so

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,839
i remember initially when i fell into

126
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,720
security

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,440
uh many years back uh it was kind of

128
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
interesting for me to see the shift

129
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,280
between then and now because back then

130
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,880
it was more like you had

131
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,000
network admins or sysadmins that's that

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,520
basically had their normal day-to-day

133
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
job and then they would also roll in

134
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,120
security things like configuring

135
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,560
firewalls or

136
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
uh responding to intrusion attempts

137
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,680
things like that so

138
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
at that time the security field so to

139
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,360
speak was more generalized

140
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,120
outside of the federal sector and it's

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
been interesting kind of watching things

142
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,919
evolve over time

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
where like eventually you saw companies

144
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
like ge and mandy and in the forefront

145
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,639
sort of defining what a

146
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,479
security operations center and incident

147
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,240
response team look like and what the

148
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
workflows look like

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
and you know started really

150
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,759
standardizing those teams and

151
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
kind of fast forward to today and uh

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
corporate internal red teams are still

153
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,440
kind of like the new kid on the block

154
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,160
along with

155
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
things like uh insider threat just

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,440
trying to figure out like

157
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
how do these new teams fit into an

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
organization

159
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
what do we do there's really not many

160
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,039
standards since it's pretty new and

161
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,800
we're all sort of learning from each

162
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
other

163
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,080
um those of us that are doing internal

164
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,960
corporate red team

165
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
we're kind of building and trying things

166
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
and seeing what sticks and works in our

167
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,199
environment

168
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
so hopefully uh from this talk i'll

169
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,880
share some things that i've learned and

170
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
hopefully you'll find them useful

171
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,080
in your organization as well so some

172
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,039
foundational

173
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,960
ground level things uh first key

174
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,320
assumption

175
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,680
uh if you're looking to start an

176
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
internal red team would be that there is

177
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,960
a blue team

178
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,479
there as in there's a security

179
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,479
operations center an incident response

180
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,560
function there that the team has the

181
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,520
ability

182
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
to see at least some visibility in the

183
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,840
environment and the ability to roll out

184
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,280
detections and essentially why i believe

185
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
that's a key assumption is because

186
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
red one of keys one of uh red's key red

187
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,759
team's key functions

188
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,280
is going to be to be that sparring

189
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
partner with blue

190
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
to ensure that the detections and

191
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,560
procedures that are in place

192
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
operating as effectively and essentially

193
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,600
help blue prepare for a real adversary

194
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,479
so my 10 000 foot view of red teaming

195
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,319
and there's a lot of little nuances that

196
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,919
i won't really get into here i'll just

197
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
kind of keep it high level

198
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,759
which is that red teams essentially test

199
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,240
the people processes and technology

200
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560
from an attacker's perspective so you're

201
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
helping drive improvements

202
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
being a sparring partner with detection

203
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,520
and response

204
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
you're also assessing the state of

205
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,840
security controls at different layers

206
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,599
and looking at attack paths and how

207
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,680
attack paths can traverse

208
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
security controls at different layers

209
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,639
and what that looks like in the

210
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,000
environment

211
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
but in my mind like effective red teams

212
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
really drive positive change so the

213
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
environment gets harder

214
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,440
blue team gets gets increased ability

215
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,840
for

216
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
detection and response based on things

217
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,199
that have been done and also just a

218
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,080
general increase

219
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,000
in the awareness in an organization

220
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
around security from an attacker's

221
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,680
mindset

222
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,160
um and so those are some things like my

223
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
personal philosophy around

224
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,560
uh internal red teams but of course like

225
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
how do we get there where do you start

226
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,919
if you're starting a new program

227
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,160
like what would you do in your first

228
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
year and so these are some things we'll

229
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,520
walk through here

230
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
uh but before we get there just kind of

231
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,880
wanted to go through some

232
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,639
key skills that are at play when it

233
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,240
comes to building out an internal

234
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,599
ranting function

235
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,199
and as a especially if you're starting

236
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,319
new it's a good chance you're going to

237
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,199
be wearing

238
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,400
different hats across different roles

239
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,039
so um an example is like your planning

240
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,879
or process development so thinking in

241
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,639
terms of how red team

242
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,400
what processes you need to put in place

243
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
and how to plan out for your your

244
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,639
year your next two years um operator

245
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,759
skills is another one

246
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,319
so the ability to navigate a corporate

247
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,160
environment and what does that look like

248
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,560
and

249
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
a lot of times from for the operator

250
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
skills these even may differ from

251
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,160
the skills you may use in a ctf while

252
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,800
you may you

253
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,960
utilize general pin testing skills on

254
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
both what's interesting

255
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
on the red team side is you're looking

256
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,919
at very different tech stacks than your

257
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,479
approach

258
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,319
in the cfp world or ctf world

259
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,560
um where like you have a lot of

260
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
integrated technologies

261
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,200
um cloud on-prem a lot of things you

262
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,719
deal with in the corporate environment

263
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,320
that you may or may not necessarily come

264
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,799
across

265
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,399
in your ctfs so um just thinking when i

266
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,839
when i mention operator skills just

267
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,760
understanding how things fit together

268
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,800
in modern corporate environments um tool

269
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
development is another

270
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
key skill just because like you may have

271
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
a need for a certain type of tool

272
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,080
to save you time or to effectively set

273
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,399
assess a application or an environment

274
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,160
maybe that tool doesn't exist on github

275
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
or you're not comfortable pulling it

276
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
down running it

277
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
so the ability to build your own

278
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,920
infrastructure automation

279
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,399
you know the ability to stand up secure

280
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,760
infrastructure quickly

281
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,000
so that uh if if it gets burned in the

282
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,959
course of a red team

283
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,040
exercise you can keep moving forward

284
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
project management like that may or may

285
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,440
not be

286
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
inside of the red team but the ability

287
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,480
to drive

288
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,560
things that red team is seeing over

289
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,920
through to completion

290
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,640
so a lot of different things here um

291
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,160
that are at play but i will say one of

292
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
the key skills i believe

293
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
that may sometimes be overlooked is the

294
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
soft skill of relationship building

295
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,640
and wolfgang really highlighted on the

296
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
importance of empathy in his talk

297
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,120
and uh that is in my opinion that's

298
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,399
really important because

299
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
just um being an effective red team it

300
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,399
takes an understanding of

301
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,040
knowing like the challenges that blue

302
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
team deals with or that

303
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
security engineering and architecture or

304
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,600
cloud security

305
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,279
just kind of understand understanding

306
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,760
the different challenges limitations

307
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
and uh being able to sort of put

308
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
yourself in our shoes and work together

309
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
as a as a cohesive unit to move things

310
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
forward

311
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
uh so another thing i wanted to do is

312
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,040
sort of lay

313
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
the foundation in terms of how you view

314
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
your internal red team

315
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,519
so while red team is not necessarily

316
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,600
like directly responsible for any of

317
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,000
these

318
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
teams there's a lot of opportunity for

319
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,680
red team to help

320
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,160
these teams and even vice versa so an

321
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
example might be let's say you have a

322
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
cloud security team in the organization

323
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
and cloud security has been seeing

324
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
things systemically

325
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,079
in the environment and they've been

326
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,839
trying to move the needle forward with

327
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,279
preventions getting things

328
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,360
fixed and they just haven't been able to

329
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,320
move things

330
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,560
forward as quickly as they like so let's

331
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,399
say you do a red team exercise and part

332
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,120
of that exercise you assess cloud

333
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
environment and you find things you find

334
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
attack paths you abuse them

335
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,360
and you have that as part of your attack

336
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,640
chain now

337
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
you can actually share that data over

338
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
with the cloud security team

339
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,480
and now you provided them with evidence

340
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
or muscle as some would say

341
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,240
in order to help drive and move things

342
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
forward that's sort of how i like to

343
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,480
view

344
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,040
renting like how can i lean into what

345
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
other teams are dealing with

346
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,800
and some challenges that they have like

347
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
and it takes relationship building

348
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,200
and then hopefully as i craft my red

349
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
team initiatives or exercises

350
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
i can make sure that i'm considering

351
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,279
those inputs from other teams in my mind

352
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,880
so that then i can help them move

353
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,720
forward things in the organization

354
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,040
and essentially what it comes down to is

355
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,880
just really building a cohesive

356
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
uh environment especially within the

357
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,399
security team uh

358
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,360
at large so that you're both basically

359
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
all teams are kind of helping each other

360
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
move forward

361
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,920
some other foundational things to think

362
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
about if you're starting a new red

363
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
team corporate internal red team is you

364
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:48,480
may

365
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
kind of deal with some preconceived

366
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
notions that differ around what does an

367
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,519
internal red team do

368
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,959
as i mentioned there's really not a lot

369
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,040
of standards here so

370
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,560
you may start in the red team and one

371
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
perspective may be hey we want you to do

372
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,959
a lot of

373
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
web application assessments or another

374
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,000
application

375
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,079
another perspective may be hey we want

376
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,279
you to do

377
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
internal corporate phishing for metrics

378
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
exercises which

379
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,360
looking talked about right in terms of

380
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,160
like how that

381
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,839
may not necessarily be the option you

382
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,360
want to go so

383
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
just understanding that there's

384
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,639
different perspectives because

385
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,880
red teams are still relatively new in

386
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
terms of dedicated functions and being

387
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,399
able to have those discussions

388
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,480
with your management chain with other

389
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,519
team members

390
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,120
to see what the expectations are and

391
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,360
level set so that for your environment

392
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,959
you know exactly how you all want to

393
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,440
define and scope red teaming

394
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,079
other things to consider for year one uh

395
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,000
year one in my book is critical because

396
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,839
if you have a successful foundation it's

397
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,880
more likely

398
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
that you'll have a longer runway for

399
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,079
success

400
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,240
but again like relationship building

401
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,120
especially

402
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
with uh assert and just understanding

403
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
where they are what strategic

404
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,920
initiatives they have in place

405
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,560
how you can help and even use some of

406
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
that for inputs into your purple team

407
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
planning which we'll talk about a little

408
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,440
bit later

409
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
what processes and docs do you need to

410
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
have in place how do you show what

411
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,399
impact you're having as an internal red

412
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,000
team like what types of assessments do

413
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,279
you run

414
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,800
all those different things you kind of

415
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,480
want to think about early as you start

416
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,839
your red team and you can

417
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,399
then begin to kind of map it out along

418
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,480
the way

419
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,000
and so now what i'll do is some

420
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
recommendations about each quarter

421
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,040
in the first year of your red team so uh

422
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,760
you'll see iq one q2 q3 q4

423
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,880
and these are just kind of

424
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,800
recommendations from my experience of

425
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,120
if you're starting a new red team

426
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,639
function things you might want to

427
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,040
consider across each quarter in order to

428
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
get things going in an effective manner

429
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,160
so

430
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,480
uh first quarter of course relationship

431
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,279
building

432
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,959
and i will say that a lot in this in

433
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,320
this talk because

434
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,560
um there's all like the technical aspect

435
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
is well known like the good

436
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
technical skills to do red teaming but

437
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,600
sometimes i think the

438
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,760
relationship part gets undersold in

439
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,279
terms of understanding

440
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,279
how valuable those are and the reality

441
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,720
is even

442
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,160
in most organizations today

443
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,839
relationships is how things move

444
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,639
forward sometimes there's red tape or

445
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,839
bureaucracy

446
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,480
in order to kind of get things done and

447
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
sometimes just knowing the right person

448
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,839
and you built rapport with them can

449
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,800
really help

450
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,720
kind of expedite and move things along a

451
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,240
lot quicker

452
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,000
other helpful documentation that you

453
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
might want to have in your first quarter

454
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,560
as a red team

455
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
is your charter and that's really like

456
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
who you are what you do

457
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
what your purpose and mission are like

458
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
what your key deliverables are who your

459
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,480
stakeholders are

460
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
you can have all that information and

461
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,839
like a wiki

462
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,760
in your organization and have it

463
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600
available to everyone at the company so

464
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,240
that

465
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
they can see that hey we have an

466
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
internal red team this is what they do

467
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,639
uh here's how to contact them uh another

468
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,320
helpful document would be the rules of

469
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,279
engagement

470
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,519
and that's really how you do what you do

471
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,000
um and so essentially things like

472
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,240
uh what's approved what's what's kind of

473
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,920
like in scope and out of scope

474
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,800
what is um the deconfliction process

475
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,079
look like so if

476
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,839
blue team finds activity that they

477
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,680
suspect to be read like what does that

478
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,760
deconfliction process look like

479
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
um are you gonna have a person who's in

480
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
the know like a white cell and

481
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,959
what does that process look like or even

482
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,880
how do you get your red team exercises

483
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,519
approved

484
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,199
like all that stuff kind of fits into

485
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,800
your rules of engagement

486
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,360
um other helpful documents that i think

487
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,959
are good to have up front

488
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,199
are your red team exercise proposal and

489
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,440
your purple team exercise proposal and i

490
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,160
actually have

491
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,320
a couple slides right after this where

492
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,399
we'll look at examples for those

493
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
uh last but not least i highly recommend

494
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,279
having a road map when you first start

495
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,160
and plan one to two years out and just

496
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,279
thinking about

497
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
you can basically use a roadmap to

498
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,560
identify where you are in terms of

499
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,959
resources and capabilities head count

500
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,720
and where you want to go like what

501
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,480
additional capabilities how do you want

502
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,440
to

503
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,519
mature your exercises so how do you want

504
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,920
to look at things like supply chain

505
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,360
attacks and how that might affect your

506
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,079
company

507
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,639
or up leveling your exercises to mimic

508
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,720
higher level adversaries

509
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,079
how do you plan to work with threat

510
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,079
intelligence to kind of

511
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,839
incorporate uh emulation or simulation

512
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,560
and so those are some things to look at

513
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
and since i mentioned emulation

514
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
simulation tim malcolm better did a good

515
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
job of sort of

516
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
explaining the difference between the

517
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,680
two for where a lot of red teams are

518
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,800
and so uh emulation is typically where

519
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,120
you

520
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,440
uh mimic the exact tools techniques and

521
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,240
procedures

522
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
of an adversary that would be interested

523
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,480
in tar

524
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
targeting your environment and

525
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,680
simulation is more

526
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,519
like you don't have a specific threat

527
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,040
actor but here

528
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,279
if you know it's basically saying if we

529
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,079
were to look at an

530
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,160
adversary with this type of capability

531
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,680
with this type of interest

532
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
and they were to target our organization

533
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
these are the tools techniques and

534
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,160
procedures

535
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
that they would use so emulation and

536
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,199
simulation

537
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,199
uh red teams may kind of switch between

538
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,519
the two across their exercises

539
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,920
but essentially you want to identify and

540
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,839
lay those out in your road map so you

541
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,599
have a starting point and at least an

542
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,438
initial vision for where you plan to go

543
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,880
so here's an example of a red team

544
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,319
exercise assessment proposal that

545
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,119
i have used myself and thought it was

546
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,640
really straightforward especially if

547
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
you're just getting started

548
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,319
for your ranting program first few

549
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,359
assessments

550
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,520
and it's very basic like it shows the

551
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
description

552
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
of the exercise whether it's going to be

553
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,039
outside in or some breach

554
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,400
information on the scope so if you're

555
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,080
going to fish is part of it how many

556
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,360
people are you fishing

557
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,440
what organizations you know maybe

558
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
are you going to do a random selection

559
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,440
for fishing or target organizations

560
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
like all that stuff is good to put in

561
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,720
here uh what

562
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,320
is like what type of fish you're going

563
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,000
to use if that's that's how you're going

564
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
to run your exercise

565
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,960
uh your dates you can even break out um

566
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,160
things like attack phases by the date

567
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,080
and then that's helpful because there

568
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
may be other things like change freezes

569
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,840
or blackouts or financial reporting

570
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,559
and while in reality an adversary is not

571
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,240
limited by those things

572
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,679
the fact of the matter is if you're a

573
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,679
new red team like building trust is

574
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,320
important

575
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
especially in that first year and so

576
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,000
there may be additional restraints that

577
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
you put on yourself like

578
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,799
running maybe you don't want to run an

579
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,240
assessment around

580
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,640
financials or or maybe you want to

581
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,320
restrict the type of assessment you run

582
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,520
on financials or

583
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,240
during blackout periods things like that

584
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
but as you build trust

585
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160
and you grow the program eventually that

586
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,919
will probably become less of a concern

587
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,120
but it's just something you may want to

588
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
consider for a new programming

589
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,960
new program looking to build uh

590
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,240
credibility

591
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,919
also you can list like your desired

592
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,799
outcomes and what controls or detection

593
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,480
response you're gonna test

594
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
even your resources so like what tools

595
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,960
you plan to use

596
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
and whether or not you're building

597
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
anything custom

598
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
so this just something as simple as this

599
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,679
you can get it up to your approvers they

600
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,440
can be in the know with exactly what

601
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,400
you're doing

602
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
when you plan to do it why you're

603
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,080
planning to do it etc

604
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,039
and essentially like have comments that

605
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,640
questions that you can go back and forth

606
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
on and answer

607
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
and essentially make an approval

608
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
decision so this is an example of one

609
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,880
that you could use

610
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,400
for your exercises for your purple team

611
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
exercises this is a template as well

612
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,000
that i've used and this one

613
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
is more collaborative between red and

614
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
blue whereas the other

615
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,039
template i just showed is more for like

616
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,640
red and it's

617
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,440
management chain and so here you're kind

618
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,039
of working with blue to figure out what

619
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,080
do we want to test

620
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,960
and why do we want to test it especially

621
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,080
kind of letting blue

622
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,840
sort of lead in that space at times to

623
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,600
figure out like hey we have run books

624
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,120
here that we really want to drill down

625
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,760
on

626
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
i think we might be missing some

627
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,799
detection gaps here

628
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,440
and crafting some purple team um

629
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,000
exercise

630
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,080
scenarios around that and that could be

631
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,440
something as simple as

632
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,520
like red and blue getting together for

633
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,480
an hour or two

634
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,039
in the same like a in a virtual room and

635
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,840
just kind of

636
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,799
knocking out the tests you can do it um

637
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,520
like

638
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
kind of collaborating over slack there's

639
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,640
like a lot of different ways you can

640
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
actually do a purple team exercise

641
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,400
uh but in this case just kind of looking

642
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
at the template you would also lay out

643
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,360
your specific

644
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,440
tests that you're going to run so you

645
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
can test by platform

646
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,120
indicate for each test whether it was

647
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,559
prevented or detected

648
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,240
and i think this is important on the red

649
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,840
team side for everything that you're

650
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,640
running

651
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,880
uh to make sure you know the things that

652
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,159
blue could take

653
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,720
and use as actionable indicators so

654
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,039
things like parent-child relationships

655
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,120
command line arguments like something

656
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,640
that blue can run with because it's one

657
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,799
thing to come to blue and say hey i just

658
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,200
i just ran a payload it's like well

659
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,640
outside of the file name

660
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,720
like what else do i have to look for so

661
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,480
i would say red can can

662
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,640
do some work up front there and sort of

663
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,200
give blue more details that they can

664
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
uh use to pivot and dig in their log

665
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,320
sources

666
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,400
but essentially for this uh template

667
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,159
you're you're identifying your tests

668
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,679
the people involved and who's going to

669
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,520
do what for the purple team exercise

670
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,799
uh so some ground level or continuing

671
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,480
our foundation

672
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,559
discussion for first quarter i

673
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,520
personally

674
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,080
this is just me but i like to run a

675
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,559
blind

676
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,440
outside in exercise before i become too

677
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
biased

678
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,320
um the reason being is like i know the

679
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
longer i stay at a company i'm going to

680
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,440
start to learn things especially working

681
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,400
in security

682
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,679
i'm going to start to learn things that

683
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,720
may taint like how i you know decide to

684
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
run an op and for sometimes that is

685
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
appropriate like you want to use insider

686
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,679
knowledge at certain points

687
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
but for this uh my first quarter i like

688
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,520
to do a blind outside end

689
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,679
keep it very short in duration like no

690
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,640
more than a week

691
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,440
very tightly scoped with objectives and

692
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,760
using very low level ttps like maybe

693
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,600
targeting the publicly facing login

694
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,480
portal

695
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,280
or a simple fish for endpoint access and

696
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,520
see if i can get keys or

697
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,200
data from the endpoint pivot somewhere

698
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,840
else something very basic but it helps

699
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
you get a feel for

700
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,600
the current state of detections and

701
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,400
controls

702
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,520
um along a very basic attack path and

703
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,080
it also helps build that credibility for

704
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,840
a new red team in the organization

705
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,559
because

706
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
while purple teaming is definitely going

707
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,080
to be integral to your first year

708
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,919
there's also this expectation that red

709
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,200
teams can also

710
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,520
um you know basically test and assess

711
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,280
the controls in our environment

712
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,760
as well and help uplift those so that's

713
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,360
just something i like to do but

714
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,640
you definitely want to make sure it

715
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,400
works in your case and it makes sense

716
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,440
uh for quarter two um i recommend

717
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
unit testing your detection so you can

718
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,720
do miter attack you can do the c2 matrix

719
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
um like those are really good starting

720
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,840
points like the

721
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
the cool thing with attack is there's a

722
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,679
lot of automated stuff like red canary

723
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,640
out now that can

724
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,559
you can just have it like run through

725
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,480
different phases of the attack that

726
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
for unit testing that you want to test

727
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,919
for your um

728
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,320
for your endpoints or even for cloud

729
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,200
even

730
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,280
and then c2 matrix is a good source

731
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
because a lot of the commonly used

732
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
uh command and control tools by red

733
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,080
teams are already available in c2 matrix

734
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,240
in fact a couple of the command control

735
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
tools i've written are in c2 matrix

736
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,440
which is which is truly

737
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,480
a cool thing for me but essentially you

738
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,919
want to gauge visibility

739
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,919
detection coverages and gaps and help

740
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,520
build and improve

741
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,320
high fidelity detections for your

742
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,840
initial purple team

743
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,320
you can one other thing you can do is

744
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,960
the

745
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,559
red team exercise you ran in the first

746
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,400
quarter you can take the things you did

747
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
that weren't detected

748
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,039
kind of break those into units and um

749
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,360
sort of replay those together with blue

750
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,279
where you can start working on things

751
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:41,760
that

752
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,520
you did that weren't detected and build

753
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,360
detection or validate that logs are in

754
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,480
place etc

755
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,120
but essentially for quarter two just

756
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,799
continuing to build relationships and

757
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,559
build out your internal red team

758
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,320
docs and processes um another thing i

759
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
thought that wolfgang pointed out

760
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,720
um which is which i thought was really

761
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,440
cool was just the mindset

762
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,679
and something that sort of conveys the

763
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,360
mindset to have as your purple team in

764
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,640
your environment but

765
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,159
just thinking about how can you

766
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,640
complicate things for attackers get them

767
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
really frustrated to the point where

768
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
they move on something else i know for

769
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,679
me and

770
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,520
the assessments or exercises that i've

771
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,279
run the more complicated

772
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,360
uh the environment is like it causes you

773
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,480
to burn time

774
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,440
and usually nobody has an unlimited

775
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,279
amount of time right there's usually an

776
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,159
end goal or endpoint so you want to

777
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,840
complicate it and have attackers burn

778
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,520
the clock and hopefully pivot and move

779
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,360
on to somewhere else

780
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,200
um and then on the flip side when it

781
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,039
comes to security controls

782
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,039
or even on the detection scene i think

783
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,960
it's also applicable but

784
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,000
simplifying things and um keeping

785
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,159
making sure you're not putting like over

786
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,120
overburdening

787
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,880
your people with unnecessary things but

788
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
empowering them while also securing it

789
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,240
so i thought that was really good

790
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,120
perspective for wolfgang to keep in mind

791
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,520
uh for quarter three i recommend like

792
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,960
continuing your unit

793
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,440
uh testing detection unit testing so

794
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,120
whether it's a miter attack

795
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,279
or c2 matrix like continue along that

796
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,840
road and get your coverage there

797
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
i also like to do another tightly scoped

798
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,320
red team exercise this can be outside in

799
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,400
or soon breach just making sure your

800
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,720
objectives are impactful from a data

801
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,279
perspective what you're going after no

802
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,799
more than one week in duration

803
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,080
so you have i guess just to recap

804
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,440
with this approach like the first

805
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
quarter you would run your initial

806
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,600
tightly scoped red team exercise the

807
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,039
second quarter you would have done a lot

808
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,520
more

809
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,240
purple teaming unit testing then in the

810
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
third quarter you're doing another

811
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,080
red team exercise that that's tightly

812
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,840
scoped and then you're also

813
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,520
uh building relationships and you're

814
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,880
continuing to share

815
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
what you're up to on a red team with

816
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
other teams such as

817
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,279
intel insider thread cloud security like

818
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,600
any other teams and within the security

819
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,440
umbrella and even outside of security

820
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,080
umbrella

821
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,600
i think one thing that's been cool that

822
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
i've have been able to do before is

823
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,440
being able to speak at other teams all

824
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,120
hands meetings that that are not even

825
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,240
security teams

826
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
just saying hey what a red team here's

827
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,840
what we do here's how to get in touch

828
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,080
with

829
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,360
us this is the kind of um workflow we

830
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,880
have are there any questions

831
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
and just sort of getting the name out

832
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,559
and the word out across

833
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,799
uh both security and non-security teams

834
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,360
and then in q4 uh you're actually

835
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,039
wrapping up the year now and it's time

836
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,960
to start demonstrating the impact that

837
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,720
you've had for year one

838
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
so things like like what have what has

839
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,480
the red team actually help drive

840
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,400
are there new high fidelity detections

841
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
new runbooks do security controls that

842
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,679
we can highlight

843
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,600
how has red team sort of leaned into

844
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,279
other strategic initiatives

845
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,799
in order and basically helped other

846
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,960
teams move things across the line

847
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
for security that they've been trying to

848
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,200
do um again the knowledge sharing brown

849
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,159
bags

850
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,000
etc those are things you can highlight

851
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,600
to demonstrate impact

852
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,400
and also this in quarter four would be a

853
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,320
good time to

854
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
basically refine your road map for year

855
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,159
two so you started it at the beginning

856
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,159
of the year now you can refine it

857
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,919
since you've sort of been doing it for

858
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,760
almost a year and think about additional

859
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,720
capabilities

860
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,400
if you need head count here's a good

861
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,000
chance to not just say you need head

862
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,720
count but

863
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,440
why and what won't get done if you don't

864
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,720
have additional head count

865
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,559
and even demonstrate before you get head

866
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,840
count approval that you already have

867
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,760
work slated out for each person

868
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,240
just makes the process a lot smoother

869
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,760
and it shows management that you've done

870
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,039
your due diligence

871
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,279
and planning and preparing uh for the

872
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,480
upcoming year of red team

873
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,640
so some additional guidelines and

874
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
approaches for red team exercises

875
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,600
themselves

876
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,000
i like to think in terms of like

877
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,120
business versus

878
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,360
tech even though you do need to know

879
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,399
tech as well

880
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,720
but i'd like to think more data driven

881
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,919
versus system driven

882
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,000
so like accessing a system is only

883
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
important really because of the data

884
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
that it contains and so thinking about

885
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,080
things

886
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
from an executive's perspective like why

887
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,120
would they care

888
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,960
and what i found is a lot of times

889
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
stories tend to resonate

890
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,720
um basically telling the story of what

891
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,799
you did why you did it how you did it

892
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,200
uh started here which led i gained

893
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
access here which then i was able to

894
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,919
pivot here

895
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,799
um here are my recommendations etc just

896
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,440
really cut

897
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,799
you know clean cut a direct path and

898
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,720
i think it's also important to identify

899
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,640
like what made your attack harder

900
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,880
so what controls worked and that's a

901
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,240
good way to

902
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,080
give credit to the teams that have

903
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
invested in security and let them know

904
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,840
that what you've done has been effective

905
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,720
or at least it slowed me down also

906
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,159
identify

907
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,799
areas for that detection and response

908
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,880
did well in i think that's important

909
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,600
because a lot of times it's a lot a lot

910
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,960
of times the tendency is to focus on

911
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,159
what was missed but

912
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,080
it's also good to call out what was not

913
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,600
missed and what was done well

914
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,960
and then of course you can identify

915
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,799
additional opportunities for betterments

916
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,600
around

917
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,440
controls or response a key thing i'd say

918
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,679
is really know your organization so in a

919
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,919
red team space it's common that our

920
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,320
debrief reports are very long and

921
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,760
detailed

922
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
uh which is great but just make sure

923
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,399
that that resonates in your environment

924
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,240
so if you're at an organization that

925
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,399
likes that kind of stuff by all means

926
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,720
but the the companies i work for tend to

927
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,399
like very succinct

928
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,120
straight to the point um like

929
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
presentations that tell a story

930
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,640
and so i typically tend to use

931
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
powerpoints that that basically get

932
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
right to the point and show the attack

933
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,200
path

934
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,120
like the evidence of access and then the

935
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,679
recommendations going forward

936
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,720
so just something to to think about

937
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,399
um next i'm going to quickly talk about

938
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,559
some approaches to red team exercises

939
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,640
themselves i did a blog post on this

940
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,320
based on things i've experienced and

941
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,399
others in the industry so four different

942
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,120
approaches

943
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,799
um that i've seen through red team

944
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,559
exercises uh first one

945
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,960
your long running exercise so a lot of

946
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,080
planning and preparation

947
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,559
up front usually involves emulating a

948
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,600
very high level

949
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,240
adversary and it's from the outside in

950
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,279
the goal is to

951
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,840
gain access and to retain access without

952
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,960
being detected

953
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,039
in order to like access data live in the

954
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,039
environment and route to meeting your

955
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,480
mission or objectives

956
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
and so usually this assessment there

957
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,080
will be multiple avenues

958
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,919
in with the assumption that at some

959
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,760
point one of those will get burned

960
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,559
but i will say this is a great north

961
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,440
star to have

962
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,279
but most organizations especially new

963
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,960
red teams we're probably not going to be

964
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,679
doing a

965
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,520
long running exercise for the first year

966
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,960
or two at least

967
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,279
um because this is better suited for

968
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,240
organizations with

969
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,480
very large and mature blue and red teams

970
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,840
where a lot of the basics have been

971
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,919
covered like unit testing

972
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,279
uh your detections etc and even on the

973
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,039
red team side it requires a considerable

974
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,200
amount of resources to emulate a very

975
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,000
high level

976
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,840
threat actor but this is a good north

977
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,080
star

978
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,559
another approach is what i call linear

979
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,679
exercises and

980
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,799
essentially what this is is some uh

981
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,080
approach that you see that some

982
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,840
adversaries will use is they'll use the

983
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,480
exact

984
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,039
same thing in terms of tools techniques

985
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,799
and procedures until that thing no

986
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,919
longer works

987
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,760
and then they'll level up and they'll

988
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
keep it there until that no longer works

989
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,279
and you kind of see that here in the

990
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,600
chart where the lightning bolts

991
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,320
represent the red team exercises and

992
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,760
like the first one here

993
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,559
you ran exercise you weren't stopped um

994
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,679
so you

995
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,519
basically the second exercise you do

996
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,200
almost the exact same thing

997
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,799
this time you're stopped so for your

998
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
third exercise you level up

999
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,039
and uh this is an interesting approach i

1000
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,480
would not recommend

1001
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,120
like having all your ops follow linear

1002
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,320
approach because you'll be kind of

1003
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,600
limited in your

1004
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,760
your adversary profile and your tools

1005
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,120
techniques and procedures but it might

1006
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,559
be interesting to have maybe two or

1007
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,679
three

1008
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,519
exercises kind of look like this and

1009
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,279
just see how that works in your

1010
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,000
environment

1011
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
one thing i do like about this approach

1012
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,760
is it does sort of emphasize

1013
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,039
closing out the uh detection response

1014
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,640
and security controls because you know

1015
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
the same thing is coming back again

1016
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,320
so if you want something you know you

1017
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,080
want to see a different technique you

1018
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,679
kind of have to close out

1019
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,880
what's currently being used um another

1020
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,519
approach is non-linear so the opposite

1021
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,360
of that where you run different

1022
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,960
exercises that are

1023
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,200
really have no relationship to to any of

1024
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,120
the others and

1025
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
there's different threat actor profiles

1026
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,279
etc and what's neat about this approach

1027
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,360
is it helps blue team see a variety of

1028
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,919
different

1029
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,559
tools techniques and procedures one

1030
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,000
thing to be careful about though is you

1031
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,679
just don't want to get the shiny object

1032
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,120
effect where it's like ooh this new

1033
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,640
attack pass out let's run it

1034
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,039
oh another one let's run that and uh

1035
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,559
while it's great to have

1036
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,960
give blue and the organization exposure

1037
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,320
to a lot of this stuff

1038
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,720
just uh make sure you have time to close

1039
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,159
out things like your

1040
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,240
detections and responses your security

1041
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,000
preventions your

1042
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,760
procedures like make sure all that stuff

1043
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,600
can be closed out before you move on to

1044
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,760
the next

1045
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,159
then of course you have uh unit testing

1046
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,679
so this is um

1047
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,200
i i won't spend too much time here

1048
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,480
because we've already covered this but

1049
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,279
this is where

1050
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,799
for example using the miter attack

1051
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,799
matrix and getting your coverage across

1052
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,720
platforms to at least detect base um

1053
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,519
like based ttps but one area that that

1054
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,279
red teams can really lean in here

1055
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,919
is sometimes we know way other ways of

1056
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,760
accomplishing those same tactics that

1057
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,440
may not necessarily be in

1058
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,760
the attack matrix so we can introduce

1059
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,440
those during our tests and we can also

1060
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,880
provide those as feedback

1061
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,679
to mitre to add them into future uh

1062
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,159
iterations of the attack matrix so

1063
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,120
opportunity there as well um so as

1064
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,880
you're planning your road map

1065
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,840
uh just things to think about for your

1066
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,960
exercises i recommend a mixture of

1067
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,640
linear and nonlinear

1068
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,039
and ensuring that you continue your unit

1069
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,320
testing coverage by platform and os

1070
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,919
and make sure you stick to whatever

1071
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,559
frequency or cadence that works for you

1072
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,640
i personally like running quarterly red

1073
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,840
team exercises

1074
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,760
because i feel like that's enough time

1075
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,440
um if it's a short scope

1076
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,480
exercise to like find an impactful

1077
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,760
attack path

1078
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,159
um do the out briefs kind of close

1079
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,600
things out

1080
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
fix the remediations and then kind of

1081
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,199
move into the next one but you have to

1082
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,000
make sure

1083
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,679
whatever cadence you pick works for your

1084
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,199
environment um

1085
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,800
and then of course for your roadmap like

1086
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,079
making sure you're watching out for

1087
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,000
areas that you can grow as a red team so

1088
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,480
what skill set gaps do you have

1089
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
collaborative exercises that's a big one

1090
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,480
like letting other teams

1091
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,440
uh jump in and help during red teams

1092
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,800
like that's a great way to build

1093
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,440
relationships across the organization

1094
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
identifying any peanut butter effect

1095
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,000
where maybe

1096
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,159
some other things that are slowing you

1097
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,679
down that are not necessarily

1098
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,399
primary red team things like being able

1099
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,000
to identify those

1100
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,639
identify some solutions and how to move

1101
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,960
forward

1102
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,839
um so here's an example of a red team

1103
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,520
workflow throughout the year that

1104
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,480
that i've used before um again just an

1105
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,599
example but

1106
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,440
i like quarterly red team exercises

1107
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,280
whether it's outside in or soon breach

1108
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,040
along with a quarterly purple team

1109
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,000
exercise

1110
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,079
and then even running like twice a year

1111
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,359
maybe some specific

1112
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,440
assessment and it could be like somebody

1113
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,160
asked or a blue team or

1114
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
security engineering comes and says hey

1115
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,520
we're rolling out a new edr product we

1116
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
want red team to help

1117
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,040
kick the tires on it or hey we need help

1118
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,800
with segmentation testing we wrote out

1119
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,760
controls

1120
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,680
that should properly segregate these

1121
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,640
environments uh while those necessarily

1122
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,880
may not uh fall under the quote unquote

1123
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,400
red team umbrella

1124
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,760
those still may be opportunities

1125
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,000
especially for a new red team

1126
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,160
for you to lean in and help other teams

1127
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,240
um with some of their initiatives

1128
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,160
um i also like dedicated research and

1129
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,680
development time so i like

1130
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,280
to do at least one to two weeks a

1131
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,480
quarter where i can build new

1132
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,040
capabilities do research on techniques

1133
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,440
do my um infrastructure automation so i

1134
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,359
can be more nimble

1135
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,200
and also like helping with the cert

1136
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,040
tabletop exercise so providing an

1137
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,079
attacker's lens

1138
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,640
on whatever scenario that you're

1139
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,400
crafting for the exercise so these are

1140
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,839
just some examples of a

1141
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,599
a workflow that you could use for a new

1142
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,000
red team

1143
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
uh next i'll jump through some metrics i

1144
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,160
also did a blog post here on some

1145
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,800
helpful

1146
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,599
metrics specific to renting exercises

1147
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,839
first one dwell time and for me i define

1148
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,680
dwell time is the time where

1149
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,440
from when a red team gets initial access

1150
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,200
to when they're booted

1151
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,760
time to initial access so the time from

1152
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,000
when you start the exercise to when you

1153
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,599
get initial access

1154
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,280
that one's pretty interesting because it

1155
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,359
may even show like some of

1156
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,960
some of the controls and how effective

1157
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,200
they are in terms of making it difficult

1158
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,440
to get that initial access point

1159
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,839
uh time to detection so your initial

1160
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,119
access time how long

1161
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,000
is that from when blue first sees you or

1162
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
even how long like where in the kill

1163
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,200
chain are you being detected

1164
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,000
uh time to remediation um like from when

1165
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,760
blue first detects you how long does it

1166
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,720
take them to

1167
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,480
remediate you those are just some

1168
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,400
examples and there's other ways you can

1169
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,760
slice the metrics but

1170
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
i think these are really cool and very

1171
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,839
specific to exercises and allows you to

1172
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:00,400
track

1173
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,079
at least with some level of consistency

1174
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,720
across exercises how things are trending

1175
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,280
i know truth of the matter is it may be

1176
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,040
difficult to do that across various

1177
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,720
exercises when

1178
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
like there may be different um

1179
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,160
visibility issues in different

1180
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,960
environments

1181
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,400
but it's still something i think you can

1182
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,960
work towards and it's very collaborative

1183
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,560
it forces blue and red to

1184
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,480
work together because neither side has

1185
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,079
the whole picture so just something to

1186
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,000
keep in mind

1187
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,480
um these metrics can also help with the

1188
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,000
storytelling in terms of

1189
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,760
answering things like how effective our

1190
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,000
remediation processes how is blue team

1191
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,240
trending across exercises are things

1192
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,200
getting harder

1193
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,119
for red team over time how are we

1194
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,800
shifting detections earlier

1195
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
so just something um to keep in mind if

1196
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,400
you're looking up thinking about like

1197
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,160
impactful metrics for an internal

1198
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,240
renting

1199
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,640
so some things um just wrapping it up

1200
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,920
around lessons learned

1201
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,079
flexibility i would say it's key when

1202
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,079
you're starting a red team function you

1203
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,400
may not do red team things all the time

1204
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,760
like you may get pulled into other

1205
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
things and and that's okay

1206
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,960
uh just make sure you're able to

1207
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,880
document uh what

1208
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,240
you know the impact of other things

1209
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,839
you're getting pulled into is on your

1210
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,359
primary objectives and

1211
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,599
map a way forward like maybe you can

1212
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,200
automate something and give it off

1213
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,079
to an appropriate team foster open

1214
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:16,640
sharing

1215
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,040
i'm big on like just being an open book

1216
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,880
not only with blue team around your

1217
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,079
tactics you're using

1218
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,400
but just in general um to other members

1219
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,320
of security or even to the organization

1220
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,880
around

1221
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,359
who the red team is and what we're doing

1222
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,960
i think that just helps raise security

1223
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,640
awareness

1224
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,480
also if you do not have a vision for

1225
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,160
ranting and someone else will

1226
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,119
so i take time up front to think broadly

1227
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,320
about the program

1228
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,480
and like beyond just the technical

1229
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,440
aspects of

1230
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,760
like the hacking piece think of it as a

1231
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,440
program and where you plan to take the

1232
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,880
program

1233
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,359
uh fell forward so like i've tried

1234
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,960
things with purple team exercises that

1235
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,520
didn't

1236
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,760
didn't work very well so that was a

1237
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,040
chance to go back and

1238
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,440
tweak it and try again uh so just keep

1239
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,280
trying things until something works in

1240
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,240
your environment

1241
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,320
uh blue team being successful is a great

1242
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,760
thing and that's the end goal

1243
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,160
what we're going for so blue stops an

1244
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,680
attack path or

1245
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,000
security prevention stop an attack path

1246
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,599
that's awesome like that's what we want

1247
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,000
to call

1248
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,280
out and make sure um like we give praise

1249
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,640
to those teams or

1250
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,160
to those efforts that have made the

1251
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,640
attack path harder uh clear concise

1252
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,520
reporting

1253
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,359
just making sure that your reporting is

1254
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,200
telling a story and it's telling it in a

1255
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,079
way that resonates

1256
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,560
with upper management i think that's

1257
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,079
that's important and helps

1258
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,720
convey like the why of your retention

1259
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,599
exercise

1260
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,839
and of course relationship building and

1261
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,359
can stress empathy enough just

1262
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,119
understanding the challenges that other

1263
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,640
teams are dealing with and

1264
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,560
leaning into the best of your ability to

1265
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,880
help them get things over the fence

1266
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,400
or by taking your outputs and seeing

1267
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
how you can help them and how they can

1268
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,560
help you

1269
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
so putting it all together uh the ground

1270
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,160
level again

1271
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
relationships your team charter your

1272
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,680
your basic documents you want to have in

1273
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,960
place up front

1274
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,319
some things to think about around your

1275
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,640
exercise your red team exercises use

1276
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:06,960
both

1277
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,440
linear and nonlinear options and keep

1278
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,000
long running

1279
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
up as your north star that you can sort

1280
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,240
of mature and work towards

1281
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,079
keep a cadence that you can stick to and

1282
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,839
that makes sense for your environment

1283
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,920
um again just make sure you can you can

1284
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,599
track meaningful metrics that will help

1285
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,680
tell your story and fail forward like

1286
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,359
don't be afraid to make mistakes that's

1287
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,800
how we all learn

1288
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,119
and continue to openly share with other

1289
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,119
teams

1290
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,280
so these are some references of some of

1291
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,760
my blog posts here that back up some of

1292
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,040
like more information on some of the

1293
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,880
things i talked about here i also

1294
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,680
recommend

1295
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,760
checking out wolfgang's design thinking

1296
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,200
for blue teams talk which was

1297
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,960
right before mine really good stuff in

1298
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,400
there um

1299
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
again this is just my lens from my

1300
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,319
experience there's other blogs

1301
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,160
out on corporate red teams as well like

1302
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,359
to malcolm better

1303
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,040
red team journal it's all sorts of

1304
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,319
different things out there that you can

1305
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,240
read on as additional resources as well

1306
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,400
so uh thank you all for listening for

1307
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,160
taking the time and

1308
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,440
i'll be hanging out in the discord

1309
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,960
channel afterwards for any questions so

1310
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,760
feel free to

1311
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
reach out

1312
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,119
i was taking screenshots of that one

1313
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,920
i have some questions perry might have

1314
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,520
some questions too

1315
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,560
bryson has no questions

1316
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,680
dave go ahead all right so first of all

1317
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,040
i can't help but notice

1318
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,440
the red teamer in your jiu jitsu photo

1319
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,599
was the one getting armbard

1320
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,800
and i do not think that's representative

1321
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,839
so um

1322
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,359
i'm gonna request the next presentation

1323
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,960
has that swapped out

1324
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,240
uh but my real question

1325
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,200
is one thing that that struck me in the

1326
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,880
initial portion of the presentation when

1327
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,000
you were talking about developing

1328
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,040
partnerships

1329
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
with other organizations within the

1330
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,240
company

1331
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
is one of the ones was obviously

1332
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,079
incident response

1333
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,480
now i will say that in a million years

1334
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,200
of doing this

1335
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,359
since i'm as old as the hills i have

1336
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,400
very rarely

1337
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,839
seen an organization

1338
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,200
be willing to share like the incident

1339
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,280
response information

1340
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,599
which is sometimes very sensitive with

1341
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,040
their red team

1342
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,359
organization have you encountered

1343
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,119
success

1344
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,920
with linking these two parts of the uh

1345
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,160
of the system

1346
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,640
yeah that's a really good point um i can

1347
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,520
say that

1348
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,880
at least in one of the organizations

1349
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,400
i've worked in that that has been the

1350
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:34,880
case

1351
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,000
um and mainly like cert would share

1352
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,839
their incident response plans for

1353
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,160
feedback or even input into like a

1354
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,440
purple team exercise

1355
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,760
so say hey like this is our run book

1356
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,040
this is how we handle

1357
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,160
i don't know i'm just gonna say now

1358
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,240
we're like a host malware infection as

1359
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,280
an example

1360
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,520
and a chance to kind of look at it see

1361
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,560
what cert does

1362
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,800
and then in our purple team exercise we

1363
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,680
can actually

1364
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,240
run through it and see if that run book

1365
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,280
makes sense or

1366
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,119
is there any gaps things we want to do

1367
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,400
to improve it

1368
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,280
um so i would say yes um i have

1369
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,359
experienced that but it kind of depends

1370
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:09,760
on

1371
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,520
on the organization because like

1372
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,200
sometimes there is more of an

1373
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,920
adversarial mindset between red and blue

1374
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,240
um but i think i guess for me personally

1375
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,160
i'm more along the lines of open sharing

1376
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,599
even on the attacker's side

1377
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,680
like even if something has not been

1378
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,040
fixed

1379
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,800
rather than trying to hide it and reuse

1380
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,200
it again uh from a ranting perspective

1381
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,720
i think it's built more beneficial to

1382
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
just share it with blue like here's the

1383
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
how the attack works underneath the hood

1384
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,560
here's everything you know about it that

1385
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,839
i know

1386
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,000
i just think it's just a better better

1387
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,599
approach to sort of uplifting the

1388
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,440
environment

1389
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,160
i was really struck by the emphasis on

1390
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,359
collaboration

1391
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,599
and empathy as someone pointed out in

1392
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,480
the chat

1393
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,119
there is a notable theme to all of these

1394
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,480
talks

1395
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,240
namely empathy um i i would ask

1396
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,040
some questions but we're about ready for

1397
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,440
our

1398
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,079
next presenter uh dave would you like to

1399
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,599

1400
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,160
