today so i hope you guys enjoy it

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,200
awesome so

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
we all know the saying i'm pretty sure

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
uh if it ain't broke don't fix it it

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,240
makes sense it's a trope

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,799
right for a reason uh we do tend to over

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,560
engineer things uh just

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,000
in case you were wondering it isn't

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
always necessary sorry

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,479
uh but the problem with this is that

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,320
we've been taking this same

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,560
approach of if it ain't broke don't fix

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,960
it to the cultural problem in an infosec

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,159
and news flash it is broken

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,880
um like a lot uh we have a lot of

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,840
self-indulgent

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
and self-perpetuating uh habits that

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
actually hurt our ability to do our job

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,479
and why we're actually here

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,680
um so we end up with

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
this situation the band-aid on a bullet

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,119
hole uh

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,680
and the problem with that is that we're

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
treating the symptom

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,119
we're not treating the problem and the

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,240
problem is

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,080
that we have a cultural issue at the

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,598
cornerstone of infosec

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,959
uh we're supposed to be creating

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,720
solutions and what we end up doing is

66
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,440
creating

67
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,879
more problems instead by trying to put

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,920
band-aids on it

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,319
so ins we know what the problem is but

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
we need to examine the why

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
um and how and how to fix it and that's

72
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
kind of what we uh wanted to talk to

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
uh today so we need to start

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,000
by remembering what we actually do here

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
um so i got to be honest with you when i

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,319
first got into security i

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,280
actually really wanted to be a cso um i

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,680
thought

79
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
this is just such a cool job like oh my

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,800
goodness the things that they do the

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
impact that they have like wow what an

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
awesome job and i gotta be honest the

83
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,160
older that i get um

84
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
and the more cesos that i meet the

85
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,160
further away from that i get

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,480
um because it is such a tough industry

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
it's such a tough job um and i

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,480
i i'm in focus like adjacent in

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,720
marketing and i still feel it so

90
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840
um what why do we do what we do right we

91
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
have to remember that and the reason is

92
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,400
uh we do it for people right we do it to

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,640
make people safer online we do it to

94
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
secure people

95
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,159
uh we don't do it to gatekeep um or

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,599
rather we shouldn't be doing it to

97
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,760
gatekeep

98
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,480
so it's hard enough to get people into

99
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,280
the industry

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,159
uh because of the type of high stress

101
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,560
and

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,040
uh you know mentality that goes along

103
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,799
with it and when you add attack

104
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,760
a toxic environment on top of that uh no

105
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,879
wonder we can't people

106
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,200
get people to stay right um so we need

107
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
to look at people

108
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
with diverse and non-technical

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
backgrounds for instance which will be

110
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,920
talked about much more later

111
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,760
but it can be super easy to forget why

112
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,519
we do what we do and

113
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,159
it's it's a really good reminder um

114
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
having a sticky note for instance

115
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
of somebody who's non-technical uh a

116
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,080
friend family member

117
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
uh and having like their name like on

118
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,439
your desk

119
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,560
this is why you're doing what you're

120
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,920
doing right yes of course the tech is

121
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,000
cool yeah we all love the technology

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,840
but we do this for the people and and we

123
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,040
really need to remember

124
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
uh that that is true

125
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,480
but first we have to acknowledge what

126
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
we're dealing with right now as it

127
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,120
exists

128
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
um we have a lot of problematic problem

129
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,840
activities or behaviors in our industry

130
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,360
that kind of get in the way of

131
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,040
accomplishing what trisha was talking

132
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,680
about

133
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
so not listening or thinking we're

134
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,919
better than other people

135
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,639
that's definitely something that i have

136
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,360
done myself

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
but also i've seen done in this industry

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
as well

139
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,800
claiming to know more than others and

140
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
kind of waving it around as a badge of

141
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,040
honor

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,320
that's definitely something that's been

143
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
done as well and and we do this to our

144
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
customers and our team members

145
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
um and also saying no before giving

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
people and ideas a chance we

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
often will shut things down if we don't

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
understand them or if we don't see

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
the point and that kind of alienates

150
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,759
people with different backgrounds or

151
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,520
ideas that are just kind of outside of

152
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
the status quo

153
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,120
and um in general all of that leads to

154
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
not being a team player which kind of

155
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,320
puts us in this

156
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,160
weird us us versus them kind of scenario

157
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
where we alienate people and we kind of

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
disclude a lot of people

159
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
so what do we end up getting we're here

160
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,240
in the industry to

161
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,199
create and develop um solutions to solve

162
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,800
problems that we see and that we want to

163
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,720
be a part of the solution for

164
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,800
what we end up with as a result of

165
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
everything that steph and tricia have

166
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,039
talked about

167
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,680
is an industry where we're we're working

168
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
with a huge gap of people and we need

169
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,199
more help and we need more people to

170
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,240
join the industry

171
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
we need more diversity of thought and

172
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
you guys hear it all the time we all

173
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,639
hear it all the time

174
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,800
but we truly need it because we've all

175
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
seen the applications and solutions

176
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,639
and capabilities that come out and

177
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,000
within hours

178
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
we see from the community the people who

179
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,039
can't use them

180
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,039
because there were gaps in how we went

181
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,120
about um creating the solution

182
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
further we end up with solutions that

183
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,479
don't actually solve the problems that

184
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,680
we're trying to solve

185
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,759
so we don't pay attention to the

186
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,199
specific problem enough

187
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,840
and learn it and understand the users

188
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,880
and the people who are going to be

189
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
impacted by it

190
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
enough to create a solution that's

191
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
really what we want

192
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
very very true uh and i'm i'm so excited

193
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,280
uh to talk about this uh because on a

194
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,639
personal note uh

195
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,240
teaching uh is is part one and uh it's

196
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
kind of how i've gotten to where i have

197
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,240
in infosec um

198
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
so one of the things we need to be doing

199
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
is we need to be teaching to educate and

200
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
inspire

201
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
not to feed our own egos like casey

202
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,880
mentioned

203
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
you know we end up with these solutions

204
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,479
that don't actually solve the problem

205
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,479
and it's because we're not teaching to

206
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,639
educate uh and inspire people

207
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,319
uh we're teaching to make ourselves feel

208
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,840
better um

209
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
so for those of you who don't know me um

210
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,199
my degree

211
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,560
is actually in the theater arts and i

212
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
fell into security uh completely

213
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
on accident and the reason i bring this

214
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
up is because

215
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,319
i realized pretty early on in my in my

216
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,759
tech and security career

217
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,520
that i learned things a lot differently

218
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,280
than the really technical people

219
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,479
and um i became to embrace that

220
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,599
and instead of instead of looking

221
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,800
as like less than i i was able to

222
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,440
take something super high-level concepts

223
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,800
and be able to bring them

224
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
to more of the non-technical people

225
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
because that's how i learned

226
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,599
right um now i'm a very big like

227
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,840
self-study person i also really

228
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
like to get my hands dirty so to speak

229
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,039
which is probably why almost every

230
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,800
single picture of me from college i'm

231
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,479
like covered in paint from working in

232
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,240
the scene shop

233
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,800
but it really became clear whenever i

234
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,160
started coaching a team

235
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,879
so we talk a lot about uh different

236
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,000
learning styles

237
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,520
uh but that means we need different

238
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,360
teaching styles as well

239
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,879
and um sorry i'm losing my horn here

240
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,360
um so we need to be take not only uh

241
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,199
addressing the different teaching styles

242
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,280
we need to be making them more available

243
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,960
to people i i got into a

244
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,400
discussion on twitter with the mutual

245
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,759
the other day talking about content

246
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,400
creation

247
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
uh which of course is what i do so i was

248
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,759
like really uh i was a little biased

249
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,319
here

250
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,280
but the question was posed okay um every

251
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,240
time i go to

252
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
like make a video or make a blog or

253
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,520
something i think well

254
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,879
somebody's probably already done it

255
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,560
before me so what's the point of me

256
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,720
doing it and my answer then is my answer

257
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,520
now

258
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,080
if you have not created it it doesn't

259
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,879
exist yet

260
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,800
even if it's a topic that somebody else

261
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
has talked about a million times

262
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,719
you are the only person who has your

263
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,320
unique experiences

264
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,958
and that unique experience might reach

265
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,760
somebody

266
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,839
that wouldn't normally understand or

267
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,799
wouldn't normally

268
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,519
even be aware of of this so when we talk

269
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,640
about teaching

270
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
um it's not just teaching internally

271
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
it's not just you know knowledge sharing

272
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,440
externally either it's about hiring it's

273
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,320
about um

274
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
really cultivating a team and that's

275
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,360
where we get the the

276
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
inspiration uh part of this

277
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
so uh again it people have different

278
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
learning styles and that's not just okay

279
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
it should be embraced and endorsed

280
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,399
which comes down to communication

281
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,640
um so as an artist my job my entire life

282
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,720
has been to communicate uh whether it's

283
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
been either literally verbally saying

284
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
lines or communicating a different a

285
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,320
change of day within a lighting

286
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,240
a lighting design or painting something

287
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,640
to communicate a feeling or thought

288
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
that's what artists do and this is

289
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,080
another good example

290
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,160
of why we need to be having people from

291
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,519
different backgrounds come into

292
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,480
technology

293
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,760
uh because we traditionally as infosec

294
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,519
are not super great at communicating

295
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,279
outside of each other we're great at

296
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,040
talking to each other we love our jargon

297
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
and acronyms don't we

298
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
but that doesn't all that doesn't like

299
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
resonate to somebody who doesn't live

300
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,360
and breathe this every day

301
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
so bringing in other people

302
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
who have different backgrounds and see i

303
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,839
say it all the time um

304
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,920
the techies speaking ones and zeros and

305
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
i speak in unicorns um

306
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,240
and that's that's critical if you've

307
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
ever been on the pre-sale side in any

308
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,600
way shape or form whether it literally

309
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
be sales or sales engineering

310
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
um you've probably had conversations

311
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,560
with customers that have said hey can

312
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,160
you come and talk to my board or can you

313
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,120
come and talk to my

314
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
my c levels because they're not

315
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,640
understanding why i need this

316
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,200
um and that's that's why we need other

317
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,120
people in the uh

318
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,440
in the room right uh the technical

319
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
skills are awesome but they are not the

320
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,399
be-all end-all

321
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,720
if you can't communicate what your

322
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,000
product does effectively

323
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
you're not going to sell anything which

324
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,800
means you don't make money which means

325
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,920
you're out of a job

326
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,399
right if you can't communicate why you

327
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,320
need a certain tool to make your job

328
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,360
easier to make

329
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
uh to make your organization more secure

330
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
then you're going to continue suffering

331
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,760
on without it

332
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,720
um and this also moves into hiring as

333
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,360
well

334
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,760
um there's like this whole meme right

335
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,680
about how the hiring managers don't know

336
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,360
how to post infosec roles

337
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
that's on us that's on us we can't

338
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,959
communicate what we need

339
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,120
um and we can't communicate what's

340
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,000
realistic

341
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
um and realism is is a huge form of

342
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
effective communication uh that i think

343
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,120
we we could be

344
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,680
doing a lot better at uh because in the

345
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,200
industry itself

346
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,560
we expect only unicorns in a field of

347
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,160
humans and then get upset when they're

348
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,800
human

349
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,079
uh so communication is is really big

350
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,040
which drops in to the left the next

351
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
point

352
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,600
it's time to drop some e it's time to

353
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,079
roll

354
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,600
with some empathy one of the things i i

355
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,519
love about infosec twitter

356
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,839
is that the community is while it has

357
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,959
its issues of course

358
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,519
genuinely has some amazingly empathetic

359
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,399
people

360
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,200
um security i said it before it's a

361
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,240
rough profession

362
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
right it's it's brutal on the mental

363
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,600
health it's

364
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,040
brutal with burnout um it's and we are

365
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
hard on ourselves because of it and

366
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
and other people um and we really need

367
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,560
to be bringing in that empathetic

368
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,880
uh level uh whenever we are talking

369
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
about our co-workers and hiring

370
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
and and and everything else um in the

371
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,200
in the spirit of being opened and uh and

372
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,760
all that

373
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,720
this is something i've actually

374
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
struggled with quite a bit um if you

375
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,760
don't know

376
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
anything about the enneagram um i'm an

377
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
enneagram three it's basically the

378
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,959
enneagram is basically like a more

379
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,880
personal version of the myers-briggs but

380
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,399
um the the three is a workaholic

381
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,519
who is feelings repressed and only cares

382
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,040
about what they perceive

383
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,600
success to be um and the reason i bring

384
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,560
this up

385
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,639
is because for a long time in my career

386
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
it was really hard for me

387
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
uh to understand where other people were

388
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
coming from because

389
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,639
i perceived that they had a

390
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,320
lower work ethic than me or that they

391
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,839
were lazy or something like that

392
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,959
and thus reacted that way and when i

393
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,320
finally realized

394
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,639
and got some other people around me um

395
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,000
that i'm very fortunate to have around

396
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,720
me who think

397
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,399
so differently than me and react to

398
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,079
things so differently than me

399
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,920
um i was able to bring that empathy into

400
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,320
uh

401
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
not only my job but my personal life it

402
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,440
made me a better friend

403
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
it made me a better employee and it made

404
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,440
me better at my job

405
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
because when we are empath not

406
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,639
empathetic we are

407
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,720
super narrow-minded and narrow-minded

408
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,680
narrow-mindedness

409
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,560
does not work well in tech or security

410
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,079
it's completely antithetical to

411
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,760
innovation which is what we have to do

412
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,120
all the time

413
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,800
um so imagine if you were a physical pen

414
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
tester and all you did was try and get

415
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,040
in the front door every single time

416
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,079
you're probably not going to be as

417
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,600
successful who's somebody who thinks to

418
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,560
go into the window

419
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,480
right so we need to be bringing this

420
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,560
empathy level uh because it will not

421
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,440
only

422
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,160
uh make you a better person but you're

423
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,880
missing a

424
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,160
huge part of your job and your market

425
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,839
if you're not being empathetic because

426
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,760
you're only communicating to those who

427
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,240
think

428
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,560
like you

429
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,680
well said trisha um

430
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,240
yeah so uh my portion of this talk is

431
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,839
definitely going to talk about inviting

432
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
and including people into this space so

433
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
along that same vein of empathy and

434
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
making sure you exercise it

435
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,160
you also have to make sure that you are

436
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,760
creating an environment that is

437
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,079
inclusive but that comes with kind of

438
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,279
challenging yourself

439
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,279
and some thoughts you may be having that

440
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,800
you're not sure you're having

441
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,480
um so next slide

442
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,199
so everyone judges a book by its cover

443
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,360
uh when i was younger i tended to go for

444
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,440
books with really interesting covers

445
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
dragons or like some pretty girl on

446
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,639
there or like some

447
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,639
girl that looked like me or whatever had

448
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,600
you there had to be something

449
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,639
eye-catching

450
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,399
um and that's the book that i would read

451
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,600
and i was a heavy reader when i was

452
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,399
younger

453
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,680
um so can you imagine how much literary

454
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
gold that i bypassed

455
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
just by doing that um how many things i

456
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,360
didn't read read because it just didn't

457
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
look good or it looked outdated or like

458
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,399
you know before my time um in that same

459
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,040
way

460
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,959
we as humans tend to judge everything

461
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
based on our experiences and what we've

462
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
come across before and it's it's not

463
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,160
completely our fault

464
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,880
um we tend to go towards the familiar as

465
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,639
a survival tactic it's it's

466
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,560
if i know what to expect even if it's

467
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
not the best thing

468
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
i'm at least safer because i know what

469
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,839
to expect as opposed to this other thing

470
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,440
that could immediately kill me

471
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,480
um upon uh interaction

472
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
so an issue that we have in this

473
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,720
industry is the tendency to judge a book

474
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,839
by its cover

475
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,920
um sometimes not even just the cover but

476
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,839
the background as well

477
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
some of that comes from implicit or

478
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,199
unconscious

479
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,320
bias what is implicit bias

480
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,279
the term was introduced in 1995 by

481
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,079
mazarin banaji and anthony greenwald

482
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,720
specifically implicit bias refers to

483
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,399
attitudes or stereotypes

484
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
that affect our understanding actions

485
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,279
and decisions in an unconscious way

486
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,519
so it makes them difficult to control

487
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,279
because we're not consciously doing it

488
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,600
but

489
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,839
our brain is often processing stuff in

490
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,320
the background much like a machine is

491
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
where we sometimes make decisions that

492
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
we don't really understand but because

493
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,560
we came up with them we kind of trust

494
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,199
them

495
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,199
uh but sometimes those could be

496
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,240
preventing

497
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
uh other things from occurring they

498
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
could be preventing

499
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
other people from getting into the

500
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,920
industry because we just don't

501
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,959
understand

502
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,519
them or they're not familiar uh what

503
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,639
does that tell us

504
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,120
uh is that we often judge candidates or

505
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
tech hopefuls

506
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,519
without actually taking in taking them

507
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,560
in on an individual case-by-case basis

508
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,360
95 of brain activity is unconscious

509
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,160
which means

510
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
when we're on autopilot we're being

511
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
controlled by whatever

512
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
preconceived notions our brains have

513
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,920
processed most of our choices

514
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,720
are impulsive emotional take little to

515
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,480
no effort just like the graphic kind of

516
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,199
shows

517
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,079
um and are just gut reactions like i

518
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,920
said that come from

519
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,519
thoughts we haven't questioned or

520
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,759
examined in a long long long time

521
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,360
sometimes we hold beliefs that we've

522
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,959
held since we were kids

523
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,400
and we just kind of stick with it

524
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,839
because we haven't really challenged

525
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
them ourselves or an experience hasn't

526
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,359
challenged them

527
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,240
next slide please

528
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,959
along that same line okobackuslight

529
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
along that same line we tend to choose

530
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,359
what is familiar which goes along

531
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,240
with what i said about survival instinct

532
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,600
think about it this way

533
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,840
the familiar something we've seen before

534
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,640
predictable

535
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,679
easy you know simple uh me

536
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,080
personally i tend to go towards familiar

537
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,760
foods i'm not the most adventurous when

538
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,120
it comes to food and

539
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,799
sometimes and think about all the food

540
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,080
that there is out there in the world i'm

541
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,320
from houston and houston has like crazy

542
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
amounts of food from all kinds of

543
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
backgrounds all kinds of ethnicities all

544
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,640
kinds of cultures

545
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,760
and there's a lot of things that i

546
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
wouldn't have tried if somebody hadn't

547
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,240
exposed me to them

548
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,720
so even on that very basic level

549
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,840
thinking about

550
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,480
just what we're missing by not uh by not

551
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
considering something that's outside of

552
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,039
our comfort zone

553
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,720
in that same way during the high

554
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,480
interviewing and hiring process

555
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
sometimes you can stick to the stats

556
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
that you're used to like a higher gpa

557
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,919
or going coming from certain schools or

558
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,320
even coming from certain high schools or

559
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,640
some sort of sports background or some

560
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,200
sort of popular university like i think

561
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,880
there are lots of reasons why people

562
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
pick what's safe they pick what seems to

563
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
be the safest choice

564
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,799
but then you end up missing out on on on

565
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,640
folks that are a lot more

566
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,559
suited for the position or could add a

567
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,240
perspective that you just never

568
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,600
knew about um so when you reject the

569
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,440
unfamiliar or the unknown you're not

570
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,520
necessarily going with the best choice

571
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,200
you're just going with the choice that

572
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,640
you understand

573
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,799
and our understanding if you are in

574
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,679
security

575
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,600
is very limited you learn new things

576
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
every day that change the way that you

577
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,799
are that you operate as a security

578
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,000
professional

579
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,919
in that same vein you should be very

580
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,520
concerned about making sure that your

581
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,400
teams are

582
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
equipped to handle different scenarios

583
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,400
that might come your way that you're not

584
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,679
more you're not familiar with

585
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,640
um also how many times have you stayed

586
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,160
in a toxic work environment because

587
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
you're afraid of the unknown

588
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
or how many times did you renew with the

589
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
problematic security vendor because you

590
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,559
didn't want to deal with the unknown

591
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,440
and also in those two situations you

592
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,400
definitely

593
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,240
were familiar with what was happening

594
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,080
but it didn't necessarily make it

595
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,240
the best choice for you so making sure

596
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,520
we think about that when it comes to

597
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,960
interviewing and hiring is definitely

598
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
important

599
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
um when we when i first joined the

600
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
industry i was truly excited just kind

601
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,640
of

602
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
like what trisha talked about earlier i

603
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
was really excited and all i wanted to

604
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,640
do was sit at the feet of linux masters

605
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,039
and learn my little heart out and it was

606
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,120
immediately apparent that i wasn't nerdy

607
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,600
enough

608
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,240
or manly enough to fit in i had to

609
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,520
literally prove my worth

610
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,320
every single day and at first you know

611
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,960
if you feel

612
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,559
insecure you kind of just like go with

613
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,160
it because you're like yeah i am

614
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
i would do a dewey but i don't even know

615
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
anything so yeah sure teach me

616
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,039
everything but as you

617
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,400
start to learn and realize that

618
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
everyone's learning you start to realize

619
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,919
that the treatment is kind of unfair and

620
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,440
it doesn't have anything to do with your

621
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,039
aptitude it doesn't have anything to do

622
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,640
with your skill set it doesn't even have

623
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,559
anything to do with your worth

624
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,000
um so when i went through that i

625
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,480
might i just felt kind of insecure about

626
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
where i stood when it came to this and

627
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
that affected my work ethic which people

628
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,120
kind of said oh you're not passionate

629
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,280
enough now you you don't you're because

630
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
we've kind of made you feel ill and

631
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,240
alienated because you're not nerdy

632
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,960
enough

633
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,280
you've kind of drifted back and now

634
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,960
you're not passionate enough so no

635
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,159
matter what i did

636
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,960
i could never win and i think because of

637
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,400
unconscious bias

638
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,799
we tend to invite those we are familiar

639
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,480
with and exclude those that we are we

640
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,039
are not used to uh and we don't do it

641
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,679
subtly

642
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,919
sometimes sometimes we really do say

643
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,280
like you're not this enough you're not

644
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,240
bad enough

645
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
um and in this uh graphic i definitely

646
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,000
used a quote from steve jobs that has

647
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,520
been shoved down my throat i'm pretty

648
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,720
sure it's been shoved down a lot of

649
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,559
people's throat there are so many

650
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,440
graphics of this quote on uh google um

651
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
and then also having the you cannot sit

652
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,080
with us

653
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,760
uh mindset or attitude and and the p-man

654
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
woman haters club kind of mentality of

655
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,280
like this is the boys club and we don't

656
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,880
want to make uncomfortable jokes because

657
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,240
the girls in the room

658
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,720
those kinds of things kind of affect the

659
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,640
environment that we're all in

660
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,520
um and it affects how people show up so

661
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:25,919
even

662
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,240
a person could be passionate but all the

663
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,679
other stuff has kind of gotten in the

664
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,360
way of them showing that

665
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,559
imagine walking going for runs if it was

666
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,720
raining during hurricane season and

667
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,159
you're in you're not in the eye of the

668
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,039
storm

669
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,480
it's going to be a lot harder to go on

670
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
that run and is there going to be

671
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,440
somebody in the car

672
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
you know or an umbrella saying hey

673
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,559
you're not passionate enough because

674
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,240
you're not running through all of this

675
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,799
no so why do we do that when it comes to

676
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,520
this industry

677
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,760
why do we make it hard for folks to be

678
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,520
here and we don't include them

679
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,559
we make it an exclusive club and then

680
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
we villainize them for it or say they're

681
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,760
not passionate enough

682
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,640
or they're not something enough next

683
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,280
slide please

684
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,919
the stats are here and the stats have

685
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,679
been here over and over people have

686
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,559
highlighted

687
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,440
what being inclusive really gets us and

688
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,520
according to this we would be

689
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,559
six times less likely to be innovative

690
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,520
2.3 times lower cash flow per employee

691
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,039
over a three year period

692
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,919
and 42 percent less more likely to leave

693
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,440
jobs within a year

694
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,559
uh so it seems that even though people

695
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,400
have stuck to their guns and said no

696
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
this is an exclusive club and if you're

697
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,559
not

698
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,480
if you don't fit the criteria you can't

699
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,000
come in

700
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
it actually benefits us to open our

701
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,919
doors and be inclusive

702
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,080
it benefits us to allow somebody to take

703
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,840
us to a new restaurant

704
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,720
and show us new foods it benefits us to

705
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,320
have different friends that show you

706
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,400
what different cultures have and you can

707
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,679
incorporate some of those

708
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,000
tenets or values in your own life it

709
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,919
benefits us to learn from our neighbors

710
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,280
and it benefits us

711
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,000
to include everyone in the in the

712
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,360
equation

713
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,440
and then something i want to say is it

714
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,280
kind of affects our technology

715
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,600
if we don't have everybody in the room

716
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,120
building these things then

717
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,720
we end up making something that is

718
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
useless for major portions of the

719
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,559
population

720
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,200
technology sometimes doesn't factor in

721
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,720
people with disabilities or people with

722
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,559
different skin tones or even people with

723
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,840
different hair types

724
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,960
as i stand here today earlier this year

725
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,280
getting on the plane i still had to have

726
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,440
my hair patted down and i've had to have

727
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
my hair padded down

728
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,600
in every every trip there's been no

729
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,400
hairstyle

730
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,640
that i've got i've had where i haven't

731
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,240
had the machine

732
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,000
flag something in my hair because of my

733
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,240
hair texture and i feel like

734
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,080
that in 2021 is very strange

735
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
um how can we say that we're making

736
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,760
great technology how can we say that

737
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,799
we're the best

738
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,200
when we don't even factor things because

739
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,559
of the people in the room

740
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,080
there's nobody in the room with my hair

741
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,600
texture so nobody's going to fix the

742
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
scanner to account for

743
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,880
curlier hair texture or kinkier hair

744
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,120
texture so you see how something that

745
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,240
has been used and

746
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,200
is used and everybody deals with it is

747
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,960
kind of mediocre because it doesn't

748
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,679
account for

749
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,600
large portions of the population with my

750
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,720
hair texture

751
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,840
um so when we're inclusive if we want to

752
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,520
take away all the fluffy stuff and just

753
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,480
focus on

754
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,880
on this we can just say that yeah it's

755
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
useful to be able to have

756
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
an inclusive culture because it makes

757
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,760
our technology greater

758
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,360
and then also makes people want to stay

759
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,520
and it's good for business

760
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,240
next slide please

761
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,039
with that being said let's try to be

762
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,400
more inclusive

763
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,840
get in losers we're changing the

764
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
industry

765
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,400
thanks that's so well said so with all

766
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
that being said

767
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,200
how are we solving the problems that

768
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,120
we're here in the industry to help with

769
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,360
so there are actually a lot of things

770
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,880
that we as

771
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,799
information security professionals like

772
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,080
to pretend that we know

773
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,799
when we really think about it we don't

774
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,559
know as well as we think we do

775
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,559
so let's start with users and and steph

776
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,400
just um talked about some really

777
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,679
relevant stuff here

778
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,000
when we pretend to understand our user

779
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,240
base what we end up creating isn't

780
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,159
solutions that are solving the problems

781
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,520
we're here to help with

782
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,440
what we're creating is something that we

783
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
hope solves some sort of problem

784
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,520
somewhere and that's a problem because

785
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,760
we know as professionals in the industry

786
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,600
that the problems we're trying to solve

787
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,360
actually need really specific

788
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
tailored solutions a lot of the time and

789
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,039
they need better solutions than what we

790
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,159
have right now

791
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,080
we need to understand our users if we're

792
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,679
going to understand what we're trying to

793
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,200
solve we're not here to build things

794
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,880
that don't have an impact or a purpose

795
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,760
we're here to help

796
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,600
make the industry better and make the

797
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
world better because

798
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,640
if we don't do it no one else is going

799
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
to do it we're here to make stuff more

800
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,919
secure so we need to pay attention to

801
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,200
what our users need

802
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,760
and this means having testers beyond

803
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
just the people building our products on

804
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,000
our

805
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,039
team and having testers that do include

806
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,400
all sorts of types of people with

807
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
backgrounds and skin types

808
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
and and everything that it may be such

809
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,559
that when we put out a solution

810
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,640
we're not suddenly missing major

811
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,000
portions of the population

812
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,039
that's the problem risk

813
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,200
some of us like talking about risk some

814
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
of us not so much

815
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,679
it often comes um through numbers that

816
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,039
we throw around

817
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,360
often to leadership we might say hey

818
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,080
here's

819
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,720
what our risk level is right now and if

820
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,440
you give us

821
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,919
the money to buy these tools and to

822
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,480
implement

823
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,799
this and that we can lower it to this

824
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,760
number

825
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,440
and there are a couple problems when we

826
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,480
do that the first one is that we know

827
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
that these numbers are essentially

828
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,520
arbitrary

829
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
they really don't mean anything and what

830
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,279
we're doing when we pretend that they

831
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,039
mean something and express them to

832
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,720
leadership or anyone else

833
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,559
who's listening to us is we're

834
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,000
pretending to be sharing

835
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,760
information and to help them understand

836
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,600
the security problem we're dealing with

837
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,039
but we're not actually helping them

838
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
understand it we're sharing information

839
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,240
that doesn't mean anything

840
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,799
further when inevitably every company

841
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,640
ends up getting asked or breached and

842
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,559
something goes wrong leadership comes

843
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,399
back and says hey you said we lowered

844
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,120
our risk

845
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,279
why did this happen and we know that

846
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,640
unless the risk is zero

847
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,559
which it's never going to be there was

848
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,559
still a chance of something happening

849
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,039
so when we kind of use terms and words

850
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,399
and numbers that really don't mean

851
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,760
anything

852
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,520
we're missing a big a big part of it so

853
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,960
we need to pay attention to that and

854
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
talk about the things that do matter

855
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,480
threat we all know saying my threat

856
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
model is not your threat model

857
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,919
and we're pretty good at knowing that

858
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,440
and taking that into account in our own

859
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,039
work in our own work environments we

860
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,320
know what we're trying to protect

861
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,080
against in our day-to-day life

862
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,520
and what we're building for and what

863
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,120
we're trying to detect and keep

864
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,559
out however as soon as we're asked to go

865
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,000
help someone else

866
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,159
we we run over and we start saying why

867
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,760
are you doing this and why are you doing

868
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,360
this this way and why aren't you doing

869
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,000
that

870
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,720
and we don't stop and say whoa we just

871
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,240
jumped the fence we went from my

872
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
environment and my experiences that i'm

873
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,279
used to

874
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,120
to someone else's and it's going to be

875
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,240
different it's going to be a different

876
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,960
environment

877
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
with different priorities and different

878
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,799
users and different functions that they

879
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,200
need

880
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,120
and they're going to be non-negotiables

881
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,559
that you need to understand

882
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,559
otherwise solutions aren't going to make

883
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,480
sense there so we need to be careful

884
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
about that

885
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,919
then we get to our actual solutions what

886
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,120
are we putting out there

887
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,640
and we'd all like to say oh the

888
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,159
solutions we're building

889
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,520
are going to change the industry and

890
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
they're going to make everything better

891
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
but we really need to reconsider this

892
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
unless you're the first one putting out

893
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,200
a new type of tool so you know if you're

894
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,120
the first one to put out first hid tool

895
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,960
or maybe the first theme tool

896
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,559
sure you're putting something new out

897
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,320
there but after that

898
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,559
we have years of people continuing to

899
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,000
put out very similar

900
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,480
tools and some maybe aren't as great but

901
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,360
they're free

902
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
and maybe there's a really big price tag

903
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,799
on the ones that work great and then

904
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,559
maybe eventually someone lowers the

905
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,480
price of a really good one

906
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
but at the end of the day they're all

907
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,840
very similar and there are two major

908
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,360
things going on here

909
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,760
one no one's actually putting them out

910
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,279
saying this is gonna 100

911
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,440
solve a problem we put them out knowing

912
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,120
that they're solving fifty percent of

913
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,320
the problem or that they're going to

914
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
detect fifty percent of the threat

915
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,240
or at the very least not detect all the

916
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,000
threats so we're putting out essentially

917
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,440
incomplete solutions

918
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,080
and that actually does have an effect

919
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,520
everyone who's going to

920
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,559
buy and then implement our solutions has

921
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,640
to then go do a trade studies and figure

922
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,000
out which one's worth buying

923
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,159
so when we just put out solutions to put

924
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,200
out solutions

925
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
we're making it more difficult for the

926
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
people who need to choose and

927
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,200
implement them to choose and implement

928
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
solutions and we're making that process

929
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,039
take longer so we do need to pay

930
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,039
attention to that and lastly

931
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,720
is the security use that we're

932
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,240
implementing is it usable

933
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,039
so for users if we talk about people who

934
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,480
are going to be directly

935
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,799
um working with whatever we're changing

936
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,240
whatever we're implementing

937
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
we need to make sure that it actually

938
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,159
works for them at the end of the day

939
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,480
things exist to serve a purpose they

940
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,559
don't exist to be secure

941
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,640
so if all we're doing is adding security

942
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,679
but making it hot

943
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,399
impossible for functions to to do their

944
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,520
to do their job

945
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,279
and to work in the timely manner they

946
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,679
need to and to provide users

947
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,919
with the functions that they need to

948
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,600
then we're just being a hindrance

949
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,679
that's not a security solution that's a

950
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,440
problem and we need to pay attention to

951
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,039
that and we need to make sure

952
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,360
that that whatever solutions we put out

953
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,879
are not just hindrances

954
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,039
so what are the things that we do need

955
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,279
to care about we need to care about our

956
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:47,840
users

957
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,919
if we're going to put out solutions that

958
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,919
are solving specific problems that we

959
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:52,559
see

960
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,159
then we need to know who's going to be

961
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,159
using our using our solutions

962
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,039
and um at the end of the day our users

963
00:30:59,039 --> 00:30:59,519
either

964
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,480
directly work with the solutions we put

965
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:02,880
out

966
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,360
they benefit from them or they deal with

967
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,200
the consequences of them

968
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,960
and whether there are benefits that we

969
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,840
expect or their consequences

970
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,440
potentially negative ones that we know

971
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
could happen we need to take all of them

972
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,240
into account

973
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
because if something goes wrong we can't

974
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,640
sit here and say oh we had no idea that

975
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,320
really important personal information

976
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,760
could potentially get leaked

977
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,519
we need to take responsibility for that

978
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,039
and we need to understand the impact

979
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,320
that it's going to have on users

980
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,279
immediately

981
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,000
and down the road if something is wrong

982
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,080
we also need to care about our team

983
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,679
because we've just spent a lot of time

984
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,600
talking about how hard it is to bring

985
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,120
the solutions to the table that are

986
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,799
going to move the industry forward

987
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,600
and really make big changes in ways and

988
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
if with our teams we're not providing

989
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,200
environments where they can really do

990
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,120
their best and bring their best ideas to

991
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,840
the table

992
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
we're hindering the ability even further

993
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,600
of us as an industry

994
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,080
to create those new solutions so we need

995
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,840
to pay attention to how hard we're

996
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,120
working our people

997
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,960
how are we caring about them how are we

998
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
making sure that they're taking breaks

999
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,120
and that they come back to the office or

1000
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,000
to work

1001
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,399
um ready to take on the day and to have

1002
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,320
new good ideas

1003
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,559
we need to support them and we also need

1004
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,840
to make sure we're listening to their

1005
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,320
ideas

1006
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,559
we simply don't have time to be ignoring

1007
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,320
ideas of these amazing people in the

1008
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,120
industry

1009
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,440
who are coming and offering us new new

1010
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,519
thoughts um and ways of trying to solve

1011
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,240
problems

1012
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,760
and frankly when we don't do that we're

1013
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,360
pushing those people right they're going

1014
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,720
to leave the industry they're going to

1015
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,080
leave the company they're going to leave

1016
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,880
your team

1017
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,320
and we're going to be left having an

1018
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,000
even harder time solving the problems

1019
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,440
we're trying to solve

1020
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,760
and lastly the business the people who

1021
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,039
are giving us the money

1022
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,679
that we need and the time and the space

1023
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,840
to implement the solutions that we know

1024
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,960
are going to help

1025
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,640
we need to have good relationships with

1026
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,480
them and this gets back into what we're

1027
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,720
talking about with risk it can't just be

1028
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,640
high-level conversations that don't mean

1029
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,799
anything depending on the audience

1030
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,200
we need to say actual information about

1031
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,279
how security works and what we need

1032
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,279
in order to build that relationship with

1033
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,120
them if we don't do that we're going to

1034
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,960
be left in a situation

1035
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,120
where there's just not trust and as a

1036
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,760
result there aren't resources allocated

1037
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,840
and further there aren't security

1038
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,279
solutions implemented

1039
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,960
that we know that we need so we need to

1040
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,919
work with this together

1041
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,760
now if you notice none of the solutions

1042
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,120
that i just said and things that we need

1043
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,159
to focus on

1044
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,559
were technical i didn't tell you what

1045
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,320
programming languages to use i didn't

1046
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,000
tell you what tools to choose

1047
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,840
or how to run your stock or what

1048
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,919
processes you need to implement

1049
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,840
they're all people they're people that

1050
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,519
were either building the solutions with

1051
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,880
or the people that are going to be using

1052
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,600
our solutions

1053
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,039
so we need to be better and there are a

1054
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,640
couple steps to doing that

1055
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,320
first of all we need to understand what

1056
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,000
we currently have

1057
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
where are users today how do they

1058
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,440
interact with technology

1059
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,799
and what are they going to expect from

1060
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,640
the solutions we put out

1061
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,720
what skills does our team bring to the

1062
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,039
table what do we have as a team

1063
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,480
that we could use to make something

1064
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,159
better and what does the industry

1065
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,519
already have

1066
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,440
once we understand that we can look and

1067
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,280
say where are the gaps

1068
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,119
where do we need to create solutions

1069
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,320
that are going to actually

1070
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,119
fix problems that exist and not put out

1071
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:17,679
half

1072
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,599
um solutions that are only solving half

1073
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,440
the problem or putting out just

1074
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,359
alternative solutions that aren't really

1075
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,719
fixing much

1076
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,040
as much as we like to harp on technical

1077
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,359
skills and really think about them a lot

1078
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,079
are they're only going as far as we

1079
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,359
understand

1080
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,079
the space that we are creating solutions

1081
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,879
for

1082
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,719
technical skills aren't going to get us

1083
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,320
anywhere if we don't understand

1084
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,560
exactly what the problem is that we're

1085
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,599
trying to fix

1086
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,839
and how we're going to fix it

1087
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,119
okay um thank you so much uh

1088
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,440
casey and steph that was just absolutely

1089
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,560
phenomenal as

1090
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,599
of as we knew it was going to be um

1091
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,160
so one of the things that all three of

1092
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,320
us collectively uh came together when we

1093
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,040
were deciding

1094
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
how to approach this talk uh we decided

1095
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,720
that we hated

1096
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,920
uh were these you know super like

1097
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,760
talks about diversity and inclusion and

1098
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,160
there's like nothing to do about it um

1099
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,359
because we've been having these

1100
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,480
conversations and uh things are still

1101
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,880
not great right uh so what we wanted to

1102
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,960
do was pull some homework together and

1103
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,160
some actual

1104
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,720
action items that can be taken and

1105
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,920
wanted to start with

1106
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,800
catering to differences um and the

1107
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,160
reason we chose the word

1108
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
catering is because it's not just

1109
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,240
accepting differences it's actually

1110
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,320
enabling them and and working towards

1111
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,960
them

1112
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,119
uh people from different industries

1113
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,400
people from different

1114
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,119
different backgrounds uh in all forms we

1115
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,119
need to be catering to those differences

1116
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,440
uh because otherwise you end up with a

1117
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,560
lot of people who feel

1118
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,359
out of place and and don't feel like

1119
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,320
part of the team

1120
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,160
and that's a big part of the problem in

1121
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,480
the industry

1122
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,440
we also need to care about people casey

1123
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,520
slides that vomits people but we

1124
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,599
actually need to care about them um

1125
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,760
we uh support them we secure them

1126
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,800
therefore they're

1127
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,280
a big portion of the people that we need

1128
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,800
to cater to like

1129
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,040
like trisha was saying caring about

1130
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,640
people is the beginning of

1131
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,760
innovation it's the beginning of just

1132
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,920
a new frontier i feel like once we do

1133
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,119
that we really

1134
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,280
really really sort so yeah that's

1135
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,050
definitely it

1136
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,359
[Music]

1137
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,440
we need to ask questions we need to ask

1138
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,119
questions related to

1139
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,800
what we're trying to solve what we're

1140
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,560
trying to create a solution for

1141
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
we need to ask our team members things

1142
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,680
how they're doing

1143
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,280
what they want to work on what their

1144
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,720
skills are we need to ask

1145
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,800
new team members hey how can we make

1146
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,720
this the right environment for you

1147
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,040
every time we make an assumption in tech

1148
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,079
we're pushing ourselves

1149
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,079
backwards honestly and we're also

1150
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,079
probably pushing other people away

1151
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,160
so we need to ask the right questions

1152
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,200
and we need to not be afraid to do that

1153
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,240
yes and on that note we need to be

1154
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,599
proactive about it

1155
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,359
right not waiting for somebody else to

1156
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,200
do it or waiting for somebody else

1157
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,880
to ask us to do it we really need to be

1158
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,119
proactive um

1159
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,040
to quote the new york city subway like

1160
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,560
see something say something

1161
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,599
right if you if you find somebody who's

1162
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,359
outside of the industry that you think

1163
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,280
maybe could have a knack for it or has

1164
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,560
some sort of interest

1165
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,000
you know reach out be a mentor to

1166
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,599
somebody that you wouldn't normally

1167
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,640
uh right um if you see somebody on your

1168
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,040
team

1169
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,079
that you feel uh or that

1170
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,480
seems uncomfortable or or a woman is

1171
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,920
getting talked over in a meeting for

1172
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,960
goodness sakes

1173
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,760
um say something right uh jump on top of

1174
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,079
it

1175
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,400
uh jump on top of it be proactive with

1176
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
the questions the caring about people

1177
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,640
the different

1178
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,480
all of this we have to be much more

1179
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,240
proactive because we're stuck

1180
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,920
in a reactive cycle in infosec

1181
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,839
also play the long game if you're

1182
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,119
thinking that listen to

1183
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,040
listening to our keynote for 45 minutes

1184
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,400
is going to change

1185
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,079
any kind of unconscious bias it is not

1186
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,400
um this is just the beginning of the

1187
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,920
process for you

1188
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,760
and like i said a lot of what we do is

1189
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,440
on autopilot so that means

1190
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,920
taking yourself off of autopilot and

1191
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,040
really looking at

1192
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,960
why you do what you do and questioning

1193
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,560
why you do what you do so

1194
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,480
think of this as the long game you know

1195
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,320
nothing good comes easy to quote i

1196
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,359
believe bob marley

1197
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,320
and if you haven't already heard of soft

1198
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
skills being referred to as core skills

1199
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,000
let us be the first people to say that

1200
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,079
for you they're not just soft skills

1201
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:36,560
they're not

1202
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,640
optional skills they're skills that are

1203
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
made going to make sure that whatever

1204
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,760
you can do technically

1205
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,200
actually has an end point and has a

1206
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,960
purpose if you can't communicate what

1207
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,000
you're able to do

1208
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,839
or what you have done you're not going

1209
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,040
to have people who are then

1210
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,280
ending up using what you're creating you

1211
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,640
got to be able to communicate

1212
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,000
you got to be able to work with your

1213
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,680
team and work together

1214
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,359
and make sure that at the end of the day

1215
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,359
what you're doing isn't just creating

1216
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,599
some technical solutions for yourself

1217
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,079
but something that everyone can use in

1218
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,599
the way that it was meant to be used

1219
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,160
awesome uh so thank you all uh

1220

1230
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,079
awesome thank you so much i just wanted

1231
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,440
to give you the clap

1232
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,160
since i know that it's hard to present

1233
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,520
to what is essentially

1234
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,800
your empty living room um but

1235
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,160
oh my dog's over there is fine your dog

1236
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,000
is learning a lot about how to build

1237
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,560
a diverse uh community which i think is

1238
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,040
great

1239
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,520
i mean the only thing we got we got two

1240
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,400
questions

1241
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,079
from the same person and they were

1242
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,079
really about you know

1243
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,079
how do we expand our concepts of

1244
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,160
diversity to also include the latino

1245
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,720
latina

1246
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,960
population and so hopefully they will be

1247
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
on the discord later

1248
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,000
and you can talk to them there um

1249
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,640
i i mean i feel like i'm a little bit of

1250
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,560
a representative of that community

1251
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,200
but also i i like to think there's an

1252
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,240
opportunity here

1253
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,319
for some sort of virtuous cycle to

1254
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,640
somehow get sparked into existence

1255
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,400
like i know we like to talk

1256
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
pessimistically because we're security

1257
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,720
people

1258
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,200
and and we see all the problems in life

1259
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,400
but i think there's

1260
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,240
maybe maybe there's a chance that we

1261
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,839
make enough of a change and it sort of

1262
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,480
spirals

1263
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,160
upwards that's my my message of hope

1264
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,400
i'm not notified i too am optimistic

1265
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,800
and can i say i found that to just be a

1266
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,560
absolutely wonderful keynote

1267
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,800
uh steph i didn't know that you were

1268
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,960
spying on me when i was a 13 year old in

1269
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,680
the library

1270
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,119
looking for young adult books but okay

1271
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,000
i i see you that's exactly the moment i

1272
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,720
was describing by the way

1273
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
yeah i remember i remember looking

1274
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,079
through the uh

1275
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,520
the books and be like oh that cover

1276
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,839
looks boring definitely passing on that

1277
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:16,640
one but it was

1278
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,359
it was absolutely wonderful um uh all

1279
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,000
three of you

1280
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,800
just did just an amazing job um i

1281
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,640
actually had multiple people message me

1282
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,480
saying that it was it was very good

1283
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,920
thank you well thank you for letting us

1284
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,839
do this we were all nervous
