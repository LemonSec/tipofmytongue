1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,960
hi and thank you for coming to my talk

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,760
today

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,600
i'm really excited to be here as this is

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,040
my first ever grim con

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,440
and it's also my first ever conference

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,200
so i thought a fun way to start off this

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,960
conference since it's all virtual is to

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,759
ask you all

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,800
my virtual audience a couple questions

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,560
the first question is do you think

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
you're a good speaker

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,279
why do you think you're a good speaker i

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,800
would guess a lot of you fell into one

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,160
of three categories

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,480
yes i think i'm a good speaker no i

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,080
don't think i'm a good speaker

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,440
or maybe i am a good speaker i want to

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,800
ask another question

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,440
do you know you're a good speaker i want

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,000
you all

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,520
to ponder that while we're talking

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,360
through this concept

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
i know i wasn't a good speaker my first

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,280
year in a big four consulting firm

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,000
i was stuttering i could not stop

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,800
shaking

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
and if someone had asked me what my name

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,160
was before i walked into an executive's

29
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,760
room i probably would have said yeah and

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,280
walked the other way and gone to the

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,120
bathroom to collect myself

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
i was too focused on having the right

33
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,879
answers instead of actually looking at

34
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,280
the situation i was solving for

35
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,438
i failed a lot of speaking engagements

36
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,439
some well in front of executives

37
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,040
and i thought the best way of failing

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,439
was to do that in front of people

39
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,600
and do it constantly but i hated that

40
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,040
way of learning and i think it's the

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,520
worst

42
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,280
to do by failing or learn by family

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,200
so instead i decided to do some research

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,560
and i practiced that research

45
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,400
every chance i could whether it was on

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,320
projects with my managers or

47
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,880
in front of rooms of executives so what

48
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,479
i learned today is those tools and i

49
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,960
wanted to share them with you

50
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,640
before we do that i think it's important

51
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,479
for you all to know who i am

52
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
my name is alexandria esposito and like

53
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
most of you i work in information

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
security

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
i never thought i'd be working in this

56
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,880
industry i thought i was going to be a

57
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,799
lawyer but i landed here and i couldn't

58
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,000
be happier

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,759
to tell you some of the three important

60
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,759
professional facts about myself that i

61
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,159
like

62
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,399
to share with everyone is that i'm

63
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,000
curious about how things break

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,719
i always have been and problem solving

65
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,040
is

66
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,759
a way to continue that passion critical

67
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,680
thinking and solving hard problems is

68
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
essentially why i became a consultant it

69
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
allows me to do that almost on a daily

70
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,318
basis

71
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,038
and then lastly communicating security

72
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,680
solutions and their impact to my clients

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
and to our clients over at grim

74
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
i am here to talk about speaking with

75
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,800
impact since

76
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
the past three years that's all i've had

77
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
to do is speak to executives

78
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,400
because about their security impacts but

79
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
on a personal level i think it's

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
important that you know about me

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,319
outside of work and i have some pictures

82
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
here on the top left hand corner you see

83
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
my dog cooper he is five years old and

84
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
he has been my shadow

85
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,280
throughout the coved pandemic and then

86
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
on the bottom left-hand corner and that

87
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
black and white picture is my dad

88
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
he's my best friend he's been my biggest

89
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,400
supporter throughout my entire life and

90
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,920
he's the first person to show me a

91
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,640
computer

92
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,160
and the first person to actually get me

93
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
interested in cyber security

94
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
and then on the bottom right hand corner

95
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
is my boyfriend michael

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,720
he has been a harsh part of my life and

97
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,319
he has taught me so much about myself

98
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
and i couldn't be happier with him

99
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,239
um and then also i love playing apex

100
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
legends with my twin brother

101
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,680
john unfortunately john and i don't have

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,120
a lot of good pictures together so

103
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
that's why he's not featured on here

104
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
so why are we here i think we need to

105
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,680
put a framework together so we all know

106
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,640
where we're going

107
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
our first step is to define

108
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,159
communication it's very important for us

109
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,280
to have a baseline

110
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
my definition of communication and your

111
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,799
definition of communication

112
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,319
might be different so let's get on the

113
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,480
same page about it on top of that

114
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,640
communication has a couple things that

115
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,680
we need to talk about

116
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
in it what makes a bad communicator what

117
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
are the pitfalls of communication right

118
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,959
and what makes communication easier um

119
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,560
and then we'll talk about that my

120
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
favorite part of this talk is the reason

121
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,720
we're here

122
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,239
is the scqa framework and in sdqa

123
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:52,959
framework

124
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,280
in our a area we're going to talk about

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
the time and difficulty factor so how do

126
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,080
we

127
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,799
factor in time and difficulty to show

128
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,920
our executives that we've thought

129
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
through the problem

130
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,959
and then lastly i will be repeating

131
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,720
these questions throughout the entire

132
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,200
talk

133
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,599
but we'll wrap up with did i understand

134
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,360
you and did you understand me

135
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
these are questions that you'll hear

136
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
throughout but it's important to keep in

137
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,040
mind that they are the driving force of

138
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,880
the scqa framework in my opinion

139
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,440
so before we can get to the core of our

140
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,080
talk we need to define our problem

141
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,800
what is communication communication has

142
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
a lot of constitutes these days it could

143
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,120
be

144
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,280
texting it could be face timing it could

145
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,160
be tweeting

146
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,880
instagramming facebooking zoom calls or

147
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,160
zoom conferences

148
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,880
or you know the casual in-person

149
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
communication that we've kind of lost

150
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,080
over the last year

151
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,919
but what does it really mean well i can

152
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,320
assume that your definition

153
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,160
and my definition are the same but i'm

154
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,000
not going to do that i'm going to define

155
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,720
it for us

156
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,320
so for the purpose of this talk

157
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
communication is the act of

158
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
not talking itself with the act of

159
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
articulating your point

160
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,919
and having it received on the other side

161
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,800
simple

162
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,919
right because there's a whole fact of

163
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,520
i need to get my point across in the

164
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
first place i need to ensure that the

165
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,080
people

166
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
in the room when they're telling me

167
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
about the problem

168
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,039
are telling me all the facts that i need

169
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,720
which is where our first question comes

170
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,639
in of did i understand you

171
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,039
have i been provided enough information

172
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,320
to be able to talk

173
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,199
about the problem and then on the other

174
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,960
side of our screen we have our audience

175
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,000
members

176
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,479
they're asking the same thing when you

177
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,160
get into that room after you've

178
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,000
gone through the whole proposal and gone

179
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
off and you're done testing for weeks

180
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,320
now it's did we understand what the

181
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,919
solution being offered

182
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,039
is and so i'm asking myself as the

183
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,800
speaker did you understand me throughout

184
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
that entire presentation

185
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
and it's important for me to be asking

186
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,120
myself that question

187
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
um on the other side of the script we

188
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,840
also have our audience asking themselves

189
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
did we even give a crap about what this

190
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
person has to say

191
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
i know that i care about the offered

192
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,840
solution that i'm presenting to these

193
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,160
executives

194
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
and i know that these executives are

195
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
very busy and likely

196
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,520
don't have a lot of time to talk about

197
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
my offered solution so

198
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,919
did you understand me comes in a lot and

199
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,600
it's going to be important as you're

200
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,639
presenting to

201
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,840
your audience

202
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,840
i want to talk a little more about these

203
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,000
questions and i know it's going to seem

204
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
a little redundant but it's important

205
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,199
that we get these right

206
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,919
communication seems simple but it's not

207
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,639
easy

208
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,240
as you can see on the right over there

209
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
in our cartoon i love cartoons i think

210
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,919
they're great at

211
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,520
depicting things that we might not be

212
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,039
able to say perfectly

213
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,840
with words but this person is saying a

214
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,199
lot of buzz words and

215
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,039
his audience is saying i have no idea

216
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,800
what he's talking about i just want to

217
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,440
help

218
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,560
so how do we not be the person

219
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,680
presenting on the right so did i

220
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
understand you these are questions that

221
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,520
i'm going to be needing to ask myself

222
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,520
before during and after the presentation

223
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,759
so what is important to my office my

224
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,759
audience is it the impact of a security

225
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,560
finding

226
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
was it something broke and we need to

227
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,759
figure out why it broke

228
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,000
was a remediation effort that failed

229
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,199
what is it

230
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
so i'm asking myself these questions

231
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
too why are you listening to me and like

232
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,919
i said to you in the beginning of this

233
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,960
presentation

234
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,800
i feel that you all are listening to me

235
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
today because i've been speaking

236
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,120
to executives and working in consulting

237
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,800
for three years which has allowed me

238
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,120
to understand this art of public

239
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,240
speaking

240
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,560
so another things that you want to ask

241
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,080
your audience or understand what your

242
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,520
audience's role is

243
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,000
do you have to solve the problem is your

244
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,360
audience having to solve for this

245
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,280
problem most likely yes that's the basic

246
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,319
question right

247
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,160
do you have to implement the solution

248
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
okay i'm offering you a solution

249
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
is now the audience job to go off and

250
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
take this offered implementation and do

251
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,599
it themselves

252
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
or are they paying me to implement this

253
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,800
solution

254
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
all very important things to understand

255
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,319
to help you

256
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,960
understand your audience and then lastly

257
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,599
you're in

258
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,360
the executive's room talking about this

259
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,440
offered solution and you want to know

260
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,879
did you understand me like most of you

261
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,879
or i hope like most of you i've been in

262
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
executive rooms and thought to myself in

263
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
a moment of insecurity

264
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,160
please please please understand what i'm

265
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
saying to you

266
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,680
i wish i had learned to ask did i answer

267
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,639
what was important

268
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,599
to the audience with facts and data did

269
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,120
i test my hypotheses

270
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,159
and further learn how to silently ask

271
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,880
the room

272
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,799
by context clues if they're

273
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,080
understanding me

274
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,320
is the room paying attention are they on

275
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
their phones what's going on

276
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,360
and are they caring about what i'm

277
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,279
proposing to them if not

278
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,200
if they're not caring how do i get them

279
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,360
to

280
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
so we can all make communication hard

281
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,360
it's the unfortunately

282
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,279
the fact of life that communication can

283
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,920
get mixed up sometimes so i wanted to

284
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
put some of the pitfalls that we've

285
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
probably all seen

286
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
here in a list of three because i like

287
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
lists of three

288
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
there's three things you can do to make

289
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
communication hard for yourself get on

290
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,240
your soapbox

291
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,839
give your audience your non-expert

292
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,399
opinion and rant as much as you possibly

293
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,519
can

294
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,760
let's just say that you've solved a very

295
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,360
hard security problem

296
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,600
we're being very high level here just so

297
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
that we can all stay on the same page

298
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
you are really excited to tell these

299
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,240
executives about your offered solution

300
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,320
how you did it all the details about how

301
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
you did it so you get up and rant as

302
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,839
much as you possibly can

303
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,200
and you don't really look up at your

304
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,640
audience while you're doing it you're

305
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:34,959
just

306
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,399
sitting here talking about your security

307
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,080
finding while that's all good

308
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
sometimes you might lose them because as

309
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,680
you can see it with another cartoon over

310
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,800
here on the left

311
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,040
you can have this internal dialogue

312
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,959
going on in front of your executive

313
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
audience and they could lose you give

314
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
your audience an unexpected opinion

315
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,680
i try to avoid the words i think and i

316
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
feel as much as i possibly can

317
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
sometimes you have to throw in the i

318
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
think and i feel just to show that this

319
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,560
is your opinion but if you can avoid

320
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,120
them

321
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,000
i suggest you do and renting as much as

322
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,560
possible

323
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
and getting on your soapbox can be

324
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,680
similar but

325
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
you're trying to engage your audience if

326
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,440
you're a solo communicator

327
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,480
you're doing it wrong and then lastly

328
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
before we get into how to do the work

329
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
there are some traits that we can all

330
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,040
develop to be good communicators

331
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,959
you want to be a listener the more that

332
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,720
you practice listening the better you

333
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,200
are

334
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,240
going to get at framing the scqa

335
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,959
framework

336
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,079
you're going to be able to find your

337
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,399
situation and listen to what's important

338
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,880
from what that person is telling you

339
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,360
the good news is you can learn this

340
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,920
skill

341
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
you can stop talking and you can start

342
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
listening to people around you to learn

343
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,399
it

344
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,720
next trait that you could possibly try

345
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,600
to develop

346
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
to be a good communicator is solution

347
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
oriented we don't want to always jump to

348
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
past experience to be a good

349
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,240
solution or to find the solution to your

350
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,200
problems but

351
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
we want to always try to put the

352
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,279
solution first which is why the scqa

353
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,200
framework will help you do this

354
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,760
and then lastly careful word choice we

355
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,120
all know as communicators

356
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
the words that we use are important so

357
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,440
how do we pick those words in a way that

358
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,079
will

359
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,560
articulate the impact of our findings i

360
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,399
like this cartoon over here on the right

361
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,440
because

362
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
this person well very wrong tactic was

363
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,480
innovative in the way that he got his

364
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,560
audience to pay attention

365
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,399
try and do that try and be innovative

366
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,000
with the way that your audience is going

367
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,920
to be engaging with you

368
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,680
don't turn on the sprinkler system but

369
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,120
definitely try and find a way

370
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,959
that your audience is going to engage

371
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,519
throughout your talk

372
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,360
how to do the work is now the most

373
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,720
important part of our talk and

374
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,240
most the reason that we're here and i'm

375
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
very excited to talk about this scqa

376
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
framework

377
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,120
so now we finally have gotten to the

378
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,720
topic that i've been wanting to discuss

379
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,399
this entire talk the sc

380
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
qa framework i might nerd out a little

381
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,079
here but this idea has

382
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,680
changed my life and the way that i look

383
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,279
at problems not only

384
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,880
problems that i'm being paid for but

385
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,160
problems that are going on in my

386
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,440
personal life

387
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,120
one thing to note that i learned about

388
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
the scqa process

389
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
is that it takes a little time to start

390
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
structuring your thinking this way

391
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,200
it's a very very structured way to think

392
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,760
about

393
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,839
problems and situations now you don't

394
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,680
always have to follow this but i think

395
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,959
it's a good idea

396
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,800
so let's dive in you always want to

397
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
start with your situation

398
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,399
you need to ask your executive or that

399
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,680
executive's delegate

400
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
as much as you possibly can to validate

401
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,959
the provided background information

402
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,959
you are a dog with a bone you're getting

403
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,480
paid to go and fix someone else's

404
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,160
problems so you want to make sure

405
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,800
that bone is right and to repeat to

406
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,560
reiterate that provided background is

407
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
ensuring that you have it

408
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,519
the situation correctly grasped so once

409
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,880
you think you have a handle of what that

410
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,160
executive is telling you

411
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,920
it's your job to take away and go and

412
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,120
start solving a problem

413
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,680
right so before we get into actually

414
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
creating a hypothesis and testing our

415
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
hypothesis we always want to make sure

416
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,120
that we understand

417
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,079
the whole situation problems and

418
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,160
solutions are bound to have limitations

419
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,320
there's dependencies before you want to

420
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,560
get to where you want to go

421
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
it may be that the company doesn't have

422
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,480
proper technology or they have too much

423
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,639
technology configured incorrectly

424
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,040
so take that background at face value

425
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
and then poke some holes

426
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,079
in it provide a reason to yourself and

427
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,200
your team for solving for this situation

428
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
what i like to do when i start projects

429
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
especially with people that i haven't

430
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,839
worked with before

431
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,720
is to ask them this question what are we

432
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,600
solving for

433
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
what do you want to get out of this

434
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,959
engagement the reason that i do this is

435
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:37,839
because

436
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,560
it helps set an end goal for all of us

437
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,279
and it helps

438
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,040
everybody understand the situation

439
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,440
correctly so once you've figured out all

440
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
the complications

441
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,120
and you are ready to go with your next

442
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,639
set from the sq

443
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,440
scqa framework you are going to want to

444
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,480
check yourself

445
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
i think question is one of the most

446
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,800
important parts of the scqa

447
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,000
framework i think this because you got

448
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,959
to check yourself

449
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,279
there's everybody has their own bias and

450
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,360
as information security professionals

451
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
we've solved a lot of different problems

452
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,880
so we tend to have the knee-jerk

453
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,279
reaction to look at a situation

454
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,680
and think oh i've solved this before

455
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
but what you want to ask yourself is

456
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
have you exalved for this to be exactly

457
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,360
the same way with the exact same

458
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
parameters with the exact same company

459
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,560
well you may have very well of solved

460
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
for a very similar situation

461
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,920
but it's not necessarily that you've

462
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,440
solved this one

463
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,560
so you want to make sure that you're

464
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
looking at it objectively and not

465
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,800
going back to confirmation by bias

466
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
so once you've questioned it you think

467
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,240
that you have a solution that you can go

468
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,120
start to test

469
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,360
i'd call them a hypothesis obviously

470
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
because we're in scientific mode

471
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,560
we're going to want to test these

472
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,800
hypotheses so

473
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
you go and now you're trying to figure

474
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
out what your offered solution is going

475
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,160
to be

476
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,480
that which leads us to our last section

477
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,279
of the scqa framework which is answer

478
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,120
i keep repeating myself here i think

479
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,480
i've said it a couple times throughout

480
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,959
the talk

481
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,639
but answer is not saying you're

482
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,000
providing an answer and this is a

483
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
definitive and the only way this problem

484
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
can be solved

485
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,519
i like to say you're offering a solution

486
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,480
because

487
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
through this careful methodology of the

488
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
scqa framework you have been able to

489
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,199
test

490
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,680
what will work in that given moment with

491
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
these given parameters

492
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
that does not mean that the situation or

493
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,519
this offered solution is always going to

494
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
be the same and will always work

495
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
but you've provided a concept for your

496
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,480
executives to go and test

497
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
themselves even though you've done the

498
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,519
testing for them

499
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,199
and see whether or not this is the

500
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,800
solution will be good for their

501
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,240
overall environment the thing about

502
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,079
offering a solution is you're accounting

503
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,680
for the fact that things are always

504
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,160
changing

505
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,600
so i like to spend a little bit of time

506
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
on this answer portion of the scqa

507
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
framework

508
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,040
because it's probably one of the most

509
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,480
important

510
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,839
it's the one where you're going to sit

511
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,000
in front of the executive and tell them

512
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,639
what you have found after they've told

513
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,920
you what their situation

514
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,560
is so at this point you might have

515
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,279
thinking

516
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,959
be thinking to yourself that you've got

517
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,480
my whole situation and my whole

518
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
presentation figured out

519
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
maybe you've drifted off gotten a couple

520
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,759
emails and you know what my offered

521
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,199
solution is

522
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,360
well even if you think you do i want you

523
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
to pay attention for a second

524
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
because you might need to re-hear that

525
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
this is really important stuff

526
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360
um one thing that we may fail to account

527
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
for in the scqa framework

528
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,959
where we assume our audience has the

529
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
same background is

530
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,440
that we're assuming that our audience is

531
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,959
on the same story as us

532
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,560
so when we're going in and framing our

533
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
offered solution we want to account for

534
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,839
something called the time

535
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,720
difficulty factor as we all know

536
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,120
executives like the answers up front

537
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
so when you're factoring in time and

538
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
difficulty you are providing that to

539
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
them

540
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
i think that with all of our solutions

541
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,680
we have

542
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,839
the ability to factor in time and

543
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,760
difficulty because it offers

544
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,400
all of the aspects of the solution

545
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,679
you're telling them

546
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,039
these are your limitations for

547
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
implementing this solution maybe it's a

548
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:15,919
resource

549
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,000
maybe it's a certain tool maybe the

550
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,520
remediation effort

551
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,799
depends upon another effort concluding

552
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,079
so while you're thinking about this

553
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,079
offered solution you need to account for

554
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,799
the level of

555
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,760
effort your audience has we all know

556
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,080
that

557
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,840
in information security there's not

558
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,679
always a level of resources

559
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
or money being thrown out to being

560
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
thrown at the solutions that are being

561
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,640
offered

562
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,039
so you need to make sure that you are

563
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,160
providing the value

564
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,880
up front to these executives by factory

565
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
again time and difficulty

566
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
because it shows that you've checked

567
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
through all the limitations of your

568
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,840
offered hypothesis

569
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,600
and you've tested your offered

570
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,960
hypothesis into your offered solution

571
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
you're also doing a couple things by

572
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
doing this time and difficulty factor

573
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
you're checking yourself which is very

574
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,240
important you're seeing that your

575
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,960
solution

576
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,320
is going to work because you've

577
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,039
accounted for all of the situation

578
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,200
and also and probably more importantly

579
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,880
you're checking your audience

580
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
while talking about your um time and

581
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
difficulty factor they're going to be

582
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
able to think in this moment

583
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,080
is the solution going to work for our

584
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,480
company i need to ask a follow-up

585
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,320
question because i don't understand how

586
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
the presenter ieu

587
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,559
has gotten to this point it allows your

588
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,600
audience to think

589
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,840
and engage with you and by the time

590
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
you're already at this point in your

591
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,799
presentation where you're offering your

592
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,600
solution

593
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,200
this is where it's very vital for them

594
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,640
to be paying attention

595
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,760
so we've gone through all of our scqa

596
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,480
framework

597
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,799
and we are at our most important

598
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,160
questions as i had said

599
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,679
earlier that these questions are going

600
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,520
to keep coming up throughout our talk

601
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,039
i think it's important to take a moment

602
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,039
here and to find something that i find

603
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,840
very useful and it's actually was

604
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,760
recently introduced to me through a book

605
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,280
called think again

606
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,440
so over here on the left hand side on my

607
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
left hand side

608
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,559
you see a chart that says conviction

609
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,600
with knowledge

610
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,039
and in the middle there's a humility

611
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
sweep so the concept

612
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
of confident humility is and as i quote

613
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,720
from this book is that many people

614
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
picture confidence as a seesaw

615
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,880
gain too much confidence and will tip

616
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,120
over into arrogance as you see in our

617
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,320
arrogant zone

618
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,559
or lose too much confidence and we

619
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,080
become meek

620
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
this is fear with humility it's where

621
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
our insecurities come out

622
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
that we will end up having a low opinion

623
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,280
of ourselves

624
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,640
and nobody wants that when they're

625
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,559
walking into an executive room or a

626
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,679
conference room

627
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,000
so how do we keep that seesaw balance

628
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,760
and how do we apply this to the act of

629
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,679
public speaking itself

630
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,440
the way i like to look at confident

631
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,160
humility is you can be confident because

632
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,520
you know the material

633
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
and that you have the ability to find

634
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,280
the solution but you also know that

635
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
there are certain things that you might

636
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,640
not have at your disposal

637
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,559
whether or not that's tool or you need

638
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,840
someone else's knowledge

639
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,720
you need to have faith that you have the

640
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
ability to be self-aware to look at

641
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,360
yourself and to

642
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,960
enlist other people if need be

643
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,640
that's why our questions of did i

644
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,159
understand you come in

645
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,799
enlisting other people is very important

646
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,080
it helps you

647
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,480
solve the problem we don't have the

648
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,720
answers all the time but we do have the

649
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,159
resources if we try hard enough

650
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,280
so as adam grant says in his book having

651
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,080
faith in our

652
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,720
capability will while we meet may not

653
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,240
have the right solution or even be

654
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,080
addressing the right problem we have the

655
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,480
tools to figure it out

656
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
it's very empowering to have this be

657
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,919
something that you

658
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,760
add to your toolkit especially while

659
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,440
you're trying to answer the question of

660
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,960
did i understand you

661
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
it does the checking of what we were

662
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
talking about within the question

663
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,240
and it not only helps you find the right

664
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,760
solution and helps you feel confident

665
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,280
while you're walking into that boardroom

666
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,120
that you looked at this situation

667
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,159
as much as you possibly could

668
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,520
now our last part of our the last part

669
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,480
of our

670
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,880
talk is something called did you

671
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,159
understand me

672
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,240
i said this again in the beginning of

673
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,919
our talk that this is probably one of

674
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,200
the more important questions that you

675
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,640
should be paying attention to and if you

676
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,039
take

677
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,200
anything away from this i hope it's the

678
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,320
scqa

679
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,960
framework and these two questions so

680
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,559
you've gone through and figured out your

681
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,120
answer

682
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
you've presented it to your executives

683
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,799
and now you need to take the temperature

684
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,200
check

685
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,679
of the room that's tough to do while

686
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,440
you're standing up there or virtually

687
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
looking at your camera

688
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,440
and trying to figure out is my audience

689
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,559
understanding me

690
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,679
do they know what i'm talking about well

691
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,120
while you're in the presentation

692
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
yourself you can check yourself first i

693
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,400
think that's the first important thing

694
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,679
that you should be doing

695
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,919
was i arrogant was i confident enough in

696
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,320
the answer that i was providing

697
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,720
now right now i'm checking my

698
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
temperature and i'm feeling pretty good

699
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
that i've explained what communication

700
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,919
is all the way through how you do the

701
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,480
work of becoming a public speaker

702
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
or at least taller royal at public

703
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
speaking which is what i was kind of

704
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,960
going for

705
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,679
here some of my favorite ways to include

706
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,440
temperature checks for our audience and

707
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,039
probably the most important

708
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,000
people in the room is ask questions it

709
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
keeps your confident humility intact

710
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,440
and it allows you to engage with the

711
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,280
audience in a way that you likely

712
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,679
wouldn't have been able to before

713
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,480
so if i were you right now i would

714
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,200
probably

715
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,039
ask you if i was in the same room with

716
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,120
you unfortunately i'm not

717
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,679
does this make sense does the scq a

718
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,440
framework make sense to you

719
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,799
if not how can i help that make sense

720
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,720
just confident humility makes sense to

721
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,159
you if not

722
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,960
how can i make or explain that so that

723
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,080
you understand

724
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,679
was there certain points that were

725
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,240
confusing what was it

726
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,000
you can let them know you can let me

727
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,080
know in the middle if on discord

728
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
if this made sense to you and i hope it

729
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,480
does but if not i would love to explain

730
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,799
any clarifications or if there were some

731
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,480
complications that maybe i didn't

732
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
account for for this framework

733
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
once you find out those answers i

734
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,159
normally like to wrap up my summary

735
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,840
with some key takeaways but first

736
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
i think the one of the most rewarding

737
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,600
things in a

738
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,440
public speaking engagement is that you

739
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
got to the end you didn't stutter you

740
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,320
did pass out

741
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,400
and you made it so you nailed it do you

742
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
think you understood what was going on

743
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,960
in this talk i really hope so

744
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,520
but before we go i will anything i want

745
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,880
you all to take away

746
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,400
these six key takeaways

747
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,360
one communication define it for yourself

748
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,720
if you don't like my method of

749
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,400
communication or my definition of

750
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,279
communication

751
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,159
i encourage you to set one for your own

752
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,520
having this definition

753
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
keeps you straight when you're using the

754
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,760
scqa framework

755
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
all the important parts of the framework

756
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,279
are there all you need to do

757
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,520
is utilize it you need to assess your

758
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,400
situation

759
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,240
and find any complications when the

760
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,880
problem is being presented to you

761
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,799
ask questions not only of yourself but

762
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,240
of your team around you

763
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,080
and you know go back and ask these

764
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,840
executives these questions if it helps

765
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,679
you test your hypothesis

766
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,799
that is the end goal having a testable

767
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,159
hypothesis once you find your answer

768
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,640
i like to say i'm offering you this

769
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,360
solution

770
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,679
based off this information and these

771
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,200
facts

772
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,960
so once you've gotten there you've

773
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
offered your solution and you've

774
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
accounted for your time and difficulty

775
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,600
for this particular situation you

776
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,200
need to make sure that the level of

777
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,159
effort is articulated to your executive

778
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:36,799
group

779
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,320
or else you're probably going to lose

780
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,000
them and they're going to say

781
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,159
why do i even care about this solution

782
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,440
right

783
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,600
last four well lastly number four

784
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,720
confident humility

785
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,559
very important i think that this is

786
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,480
something that we can all start you into

787
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,520
and listen to our daily tools right i

788
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,440
want to check myself i'm very confident

789
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,760
in the strengths that i have but also

790
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,360
very aware that maybe i don't have a

791
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,880
tool or a person

792
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
with the knowledge that i need to solve

793
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,279
this problem so how do i get that tool

794
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,520
and how do i enlist these people

795
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,840
since i have confident humility i know

796
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,600
when to enlist other people which is our

797
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,039
number five takeaway

798
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,960
and you know your weaknesses you're able

799
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,559
to involve not only

800
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,400
other people from your team but your

801
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,080
audience while you're in the room

802
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,960
it takes a very transparent approach to

803
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,120
telling executives about very sensitive

804
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,799
problems that they're trusting you to

805
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,600
solve

806
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,480
and most importantly do you do i

807
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,679
understand

808
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,840
i think that these questions if anything

809
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,440
are understanding your audience and

810
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,360
understanding yourself making sure that

811
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,600
you're looking at a situation in a way

812
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,679
that allows you to solve a problem that

813
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,720
maybe was unsolvable before you came

814
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
my name is alex esposito and thank you

815
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,679
for coming to my talk
