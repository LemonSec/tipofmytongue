1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
um anyway james is a former u.s marine

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,440
um specializing in what i

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,599
i guess we euphemistically call signals

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,960
intelligence

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,480
um and of course uh a graduate of the

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,320
uh korean for signals intelligence

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,359
school

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
um and i i actually don't know how far

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,199
that

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,800
gets you with conversational korean but

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,519
i assume it's pretty good

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,439
uh i get a i get a free donut or a free

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,520
beer every once in a while so i think

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,200
all in all i can chalk it up to a

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
success

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,640
all right fair enough fair enough so um

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,559
he's the ceo of boise idaho

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,320
based company um and uh it's called

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,399
shadowscape which is a name that i was

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,800
very jealous of when i first read it

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,800
and and is going to be given a talk this

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,840
talk's called know

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,920
thyself or know thy enemy know thyself i

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,280
guess enemy first self

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,840
last you're switching the old sun tzu

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,040
comments

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
um backwards so that that's that

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,360
we're gonna go straight to it i'm gonna

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
turn this off

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,799
all right let me uh jump in here

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:26,280
share my uh screen

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,159
[Music]

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
all right can you all see that

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,159
you are good to go perfect all right

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,439
we'll uh appreciate

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,840
uh you guys tuning in to my talk today

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,000
uh especially

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
thank you to uh to grim khan for the

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,720
opportunity to speak

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,759
um the uh the title of my

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,240
my talk today is is know thy enemy know

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,479
thyself a little bit of

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,240
a a switcheroo there as as was stated uh

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,840
which is kind of a um overview of of the

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,799
issues of

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,079
a lot of the things that we're going to

47
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,399
be talking about um with

48
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
how security is his approach today and

49
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,560
maybe how we can uh

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,680
utilize what we know about the adversary

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
um to apply threat-based

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,800
uh defensive actions um so before uh

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
before we kick those those things off um

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
just just give you a little bit of uh

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,520
insight into my background and why

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
uh i approach things uh the way that

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,959
that i do

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,000
um as was mentioned um i'm a former

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,879
united states marine corps uh signals

60
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,560
intelligence analyst and

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
uh korean cryptologic linguist um

62
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
going down that that road was something

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
that i just kind of

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,920
fell into and took me down this path

65
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,440
um was heavily focused on

66
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,920
[Music]

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,239
digital forensics specifically mobile

68
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,200
forensics

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,239
and uh as as i moved

70
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
forward um down that road

71
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,959
uh cell phones started to get a lot more

72
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,280
complicated um using the the

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,159
intelligence

74
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,400
processes that we were um utilizing

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
um to conduct forensic investigations

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,200
things like that um cell phones started

77
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,640
to emulate more

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,200
computers and and which kind of pushed

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,920
me into

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,560
network uh forensics and network

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,440
security and

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,879
and things like that but i've always

83
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,440
been kind of an intelligence nerd

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
uh to the core so um

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,360
during my time once i got out of the the

86
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,000
marines

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
i was teaching nato's special forces in

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,560
belgium

89
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,920
in intelligence-led operations and

90
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,480
one of the main components of uh of what

91
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,599
we were doing there

92
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,959
was um trying to

93
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,879
essentially curb the the ied threat

94
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
which had become very pervasive and in

95
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,000
doing so

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
we'd started to kind of adopt all source

97
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,920
intelligence

98
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,560
amalgamation efforts to really try to

99
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,798
understand the adversary on a human

100
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,680
level

101
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,519
um and in doing so um

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
this this experience really kind of

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,120
helped

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
lead me into the way that that i

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,120
approach cyber security

106
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
um i i also served as a digital

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
forensics and threat intelligence

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,199
instructor to governments and and

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,639
military

110
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,000
all around the world chasing bad guys

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
and i spent about six ish years

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,080
at a cyber security firm called route 9b

113
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,400
serving as their technical director

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
of uh threat intelligence

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
helping to to implement uh intelligence

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
solutions there

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,360
uh among other things

118
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,000
so uh it obviously have to

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,840
obligatory uh quote sun tzu

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,479
uh if you know the enemy and know

121
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,199
yourself

122
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
you need not fear the result of a

123
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,280
hundred battles if you know yourself

124
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
but not the enemy for every victory

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,479
gained

126
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,560
you will also suffer a defeat if you

127
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
know neither the enemy nor yourself you

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
will succumb in every battle

129
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,639
um so i i would be remiss if i didn't go

130
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
down that road uh one for the

131
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,039
the title of the uh of today's talk but

132
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,639
secondly really when

133
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,120
when we break down what we're facing

134
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,919
here

135
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,280
um it really is a a conflict just like

136
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,000
any other

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,280
um there are you know

138
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,080
there's there's an adversary that is is

139
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,720
using

140
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,280
um you know what they can understand

141
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
about the environment to their advantage

142
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
and obviously we are trying to defend

143
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,880
ourselves

144
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
against those adversaries um so we're

145
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,000
gonna go

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
uh uh through a little bit why it's so

147
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,000
important to

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,560
uh to know oneself and and secondly how

149
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,520
we can do that

150
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,120
on a uh on a security level but secondly

151
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,759
how to

152
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,960
uh to apply these lessons to um

153
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,319
security analytics

154
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
so i think it's important to uh to

155
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,919
highlight

156
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,280
a little bit why why the industry fails

157
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,800
or at least

158
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
shed some light on that um first of all

159
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,400
um

160
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
you know looking at at the uh

161
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,440
the uh scattered array of of

162
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,880
uh corpses left behind we have

163
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,840
you know the the recent uh microsoft

164
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,759
exchange

165
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,520
solarwinds garmin equifax

166
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,479
there the list goes it's it's every year

167
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,800
every month every week right

168
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
these organizations they spend millions

169
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,919
on security

170
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,919
every year yet still get attacked

171
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,960
so i i think it's important to uh

172
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,919
to focus on these individual

173
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,680
organizations because

174
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
what it highlights to me is that there's

175
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
not a lack of

176
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
of money being thrown at the problem

177
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
right um

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
solarwinds is is interesting especially

179
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,520
to me because it illustrates kind of a

180
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,960
breakdown or or failure that was

181
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,120
successful in most cases

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
um due to you know a supply chain

183
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,280
incident

184
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,000
uh i i guess we could chalk it up too as

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,319
an

186
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,840
update was pushed out that uh

187
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,400
was able to serve as a dropper for

188
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
subsequent attacks

189
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,720
um but what it really illustrates to me

190
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,440
is a

191
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
a subsequent cascading series of

192
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,440
of failures right because getting into

193
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,840
the network is obviously just the first

194
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,120
um

195
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
the the first uh foray into the network

196
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:02,960
and

197
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,599
what they're really trying to accomplish

198
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,080
is

199
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,479
far more insidious as they move through

200
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,680
our network and

201
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,000
so there are subsequent failures that

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
need to be

203
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
uh highlighted um

204
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,759
one of the uh the things that uh

205
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,919
that i think we need to focus on is a

206
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,080
lack of threat-based analysis

207
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,039
and assessment and cyber risks uh even

208
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,000
amongst the

209
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
security practitioners and this has been

210
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
a little bit of a theme in this

211
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,799
conference so far

212
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,760
is assessment of cyber risk um so i'm

213
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,440
going to talk on that a little bit here

214
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
but uh also give some ideas of how you

215
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:40,799
can

216
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,000
uh quantify and qualify

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,560
cyber risks as you go and in doing so

218
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,519
start to make meaningful communications

219
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,959
to decision makers

220
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,399
within within our environment for

221
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,360
what we need to prioritize in terms of

222
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,279
our our security infrastructure

223
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,560
so uh secondly or thirdly the cyber

224
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
adversary is adaptive

225
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,720
to new developments uh in the security

226
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,600
space

227
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
uh it's not a a static

228
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,399
job that we've got right we never throw

229
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,440
our hands up and

230
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,640
you know dust our hands off and say uh

231
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,399
you know pat ourselves on the back

232
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
because we're secure now right

233
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,080
um in in my opinion uh

234
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,920
there there's really no such thing as

235
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,160
security security is just a

236
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,800
a catch-all term right which really what

237
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,959
we're trying to communicate when we say

238
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,200
are we secure is we're trying to say

239
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
that we

240
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,000
have reached an acceptable level of risk

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,200
right um so

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,959
we're gonna be talking about what

243
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,480
constitutes acceptable

244
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,839
uh levels of risk um

245
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,920
so uh we'll we'll get into that here in

246
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,120
a moment

247
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
um and then uh you know it was said

248
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,959
in the the keynote uh as well as some

249
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
other previous talks

250
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,440
and intelligence decision makers are

251
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,880
rarely the ones tasked with

252
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,240
uh protecting our our networks

253
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,079
conversely as security practice

254
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,440
practitioners

255
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,399
how often are we really communicating uh

256
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:20,800
in

257
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
in risk how how often are we quantifying

258
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,240
the actual impact that's going to uh

259
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,640
to pertain to our network and and how we

260
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,000
can shut that down so

261
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,399
when i go and i make a case that hey we

262
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,120
need to

263
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
implement this this new security

264
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
safeguard

265
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,519
um the the question is uh typically

266
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,839
why right what am i getting out of it

267
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,720
and so

268
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,760
i think part of what we need to uh to be

269
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,800
able to communicate

270
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,079
is return on investment uh and secondly

271
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,040
uh you know a cost benefit analysis

272
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,360
right

273
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,040
how much is it gonna cost us to go down

274
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
this road versus what are we getting out

275
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,839
of it

276
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,760
all right so the problems um security

277
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,040
can be confusing

278
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,000
uh even for security practitioners uh

279
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,160
even when we've got a good handle on

280
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
on the things that need to be done

281
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
keeping track of these things can be

282
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,920
uh super daunting uh it's very

283
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,720
very uh difficult to figure cyber risks

284
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,600
without

285
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,880
a you know strong knowledge of

286
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,800
not just the adversary but how they

287
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
conduct their operations

288
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,519
uh and then secondly it's it's really

289
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,160
difficult

290
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
to understand what threats you need to

291
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
be concerned about

292
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
without really assessing yourself um

293
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
and what i think ends up uh uh

294
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,320
being missed is a a common area where

295
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,680
where people can kind of put together um

296
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,959
the uh the the information that they're

297
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,600
gathering

298
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,240
both internally and externally so so

299
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
we'll get to that

300
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,839
uh company owners c-suite executives um

301
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,920
constantly unsure if the security

302
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
they're employing is

303
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,320
adequately uh protecting them um to

304
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,160
really just kind of taking on the the

305
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,560
hope

306
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,160
strategy um saying you know i

307
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,839
uh i hope that the the folks that i've

308
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,800
i've hired

309
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,360
are you know proficient enough to make

310
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,600
sure that we're being safe but

311
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,079
a lot of times it's it's similar that

312
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,040
they they

313
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
may not know what questions to be asking

314
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,079
right um

315
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,440
and and similarly uh it's pretty common

316
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,839
for

317
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,360
those that are tasked with network

318
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,079
security to not necessarily know where

319
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:40,399
the

320
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,760
the quote crown jewels are or really

321
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,480
assess

322
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,720
what uh what the impacts would be and i

323
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
think we see that

324
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
uh pretty often and i think we're taught

325
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,320
these principles a lot

326
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,720
academically but rarely are we

327
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,800
really putting them into practice which

328
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,760
is uh

329
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,720
unfortunate because i think uh in in

330
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,519
many cases

331
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
this this kind of approach should be the

332
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
priority

333
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
um as we

334
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
move forward and we we implement network

335
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
security controls

336
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,399
um a lot of gaps can be

337
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,000
be left or or maybe better put more

338
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,279
blind spots right um areas that we don't

339
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,560
even know

340
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,839
exist and and one of the uh the

341
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,600
the um one of the main components of

342
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,680
intelligence is really trying to

343
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,120
understand uh your your

344
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
unknown unknowns turn them into things

345
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,639
that you you know about

346
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
maybe you're not sure about you know the

347
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,399
threats that they pose but at least you

348
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,279
know that it's an

349
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,399
issue so as we go forward and we we

350
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,040
gather that

351
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,160
intelligence uh i think it's important

352
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
to understand the difference between

353
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,959
uh what we refer to as is you know

354
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,120
simply threat intelligence which is

355
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,959
always you know focusing on the

356
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,399
adversary and

357
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,360
uh sometimes can be sort of a colloquial

358
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,920
term

359
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,079
for uh data right that that is

360
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:14,079
non-contextual versus

361
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,240
cyber intelligence where we're really

362
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,440
trying to understand

363
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,920
uh our internal network we're trying to

364
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,040
understand

365
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,079
uh the external adversary uh and

366
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:24,720
understand

367
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,680
what pertains to what right and so as we

368
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,399
do that we start to realize and start to

369
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,440
root out

370
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,040
those uh those blind spots um

371
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
we've talked a lot about uh

372
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,040
communication uh in this conference and

373
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
i think a big part of that is the

374
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,839
the empathy theme that seems to be uh

375
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,079
permeating a lot of the the talks right

376
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,279
trying to understand um you know

377
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,399
what uh what somebody needs to hear

378
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,920
right uh if we're frustrated uh that

379
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,279
we're not being heard

380
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,600
as as security practitioners maybe we

381
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,959
need to rethink

382
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,680
how to say what we're saying because we

383
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,880
need to understand that

384
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,160
a lot of the folks that uh are making

385
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,279
the decisions

386
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,320
on where to you know spend security

387
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
dollars and and time and effort and

388
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,680
resources

389
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,440
are not necessarily technical and that's

390
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
not their fault that's

391
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
not necessarily their job um

392
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,440
so you know even if you're right about

393
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,000
the

394
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,920
the issues if you can't communicate

395
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
those problems

396
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
it amounts to nothing right being right

397
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,199
is not going to get you a whole lot

398
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,160
and then in many cases we're still too

399
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,639
focused on perimeter-based security uh

400
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,839
what i what i see a lot of times is

401
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,759
you know people will talk about uh

402
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,320
perimeter-based or defense in depth and

403
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,920
and say yeah we need to get away from

404
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,399
perimeter-based security

405
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,759
but what i find is just several layers

406
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,040
of perimeter

407
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,440
uh and then still kind of that soft

408
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
gooey center and i think that's uh

409
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,279
one of the issues that we really need to

410
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,560
understand

411
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
is uh in in the last talk or

412
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
or it might have been wolf's talk uh

413
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,079
talking about fishing right the fishing

414
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:12,800
problem

415
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,240
where uh you know we're so

416
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,399
focused on making sure that the the

417
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,480
users don't click on certain things even

418
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,320
though that we know that they're going

419
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
to

420
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,320
um if that's really your emphasis then

421
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
that means you haven't done the leg work

422
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,560
uh to to prohibit malicious behavior

423
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,680
inside your your network um that's

424
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,920
that's initial access right that is

425
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,480
that's the first uh foothold in your

426
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,360
network and

427
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,079
and similarly to the the solarwinds

428
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:44,880
exploit we're

429
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,000
still in the same stage of attack uh in

430
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
terms of

431
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,279
just gaining that that initial foothold

432
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,240
but there are a

433
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,360
cascading series of failures but we can

434
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,440
change that and think about these are

435
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,480
opportunities right to shut down uh

436
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,160
additional uh attack vectors so

437
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,359
we need to be thinking in terms of

438
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,559
that uh sort of that attack framework

439
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,599
uh mindset of where we have

440
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,679
a lot of opportunities to shut things

441
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,000
down as long as we're approaching

442
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,799
it from that uh that standpoint and uh

443
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,240
and we'll get to more of that here in a

444
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
moment

445
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,119
so uh where we can succeed right uh it's

446
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,480
about analysis

447
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,360
um implement threat based security

448
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
strategies

449
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,600
with either adversaries tactics or risk

450
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,480
analysis

451
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,520
in mind that's what i really see

452
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,799
uh lacking when we are talking about

453
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,160
a strategic approach to intelligence is

454
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,039
are we really trying to understand uh

455
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,320
you know both

456
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,440
ourselves our internal safeguards and

457
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,160
the adversary and make those uh those

458
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,520
links right so uh one of the the things

459
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,080
that we

460
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,120
commonly talk about uh in in our

461
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
training

462
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,280
and uh things that we talk about in uh

463
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
in the military right is the

464
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,000
the concept of the ooda loop the observe

465
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
orient the side act process right

466
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,640
um either your environment will be used

467
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,559
against the adversary or against

468
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,679
yourself and

469
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,480
more often than not that really just

470
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,440
comes down to

471
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,160
who is better at understanding the

472
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,960
environment

473
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,400
and using those vulnerabilities um

474
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,559
you know against ourselves that's that's

475
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
something that we definitely want to

476
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,919
shut down we want to make sure that it's

477
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,320
very

478
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,600
difficult for the adversary to uh to

479
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,320
understand

480
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,039
our network because when we get down to

481
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,760
it

482
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,400
understanding our adversary is is just

483
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
like any other conflict there's a

484
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
confluence of opportunity

485
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,559
right which is the vulnerabilities and

486
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,280
and the

487
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,640
infrastructure that we have posed to a

488
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,960
potential adversary and then the motive

489
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,200
right the motive is one of those things

490
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,799
that's going to be very difficult for us

491
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,280
to get rid of i can't really take away

492
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,400
somebody's desire necessarily to uh to

493
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,919
attack my network

494
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,320
but i can make it more cumbersome than

495
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,360
it's worth

496
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,240
right and so on the motive side we'll

497
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
we'll talk about some of those uh

498
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,039
approaches but on the opportunity side

499
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,919
uh are we really trying to make it so

500
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,760
it's confusing it's difficult to

501
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,640
navigate

502
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,760
and uh and there are more lucrative

503
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,960
targets out there

504
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,720
or is it a a target rich environment

505
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
right so when we approach

506
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,080
it from that that standpoint we'll talk

507
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
about how we can

508
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,799
one get rid of some of these

509
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,640
opportunities but to

510
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,280
um address the the motives for an

511
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,160
adversary and

512
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,240
and how we can make that you know kind

513
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,720
of difficult

514
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,600
is our intelligence actionable um and

515
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
what i mean by that is

516
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,799
the the information that we then exploit

517
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,960
and analyze and turn into intelligence

518
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,520
is it something that we can actually use

519
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,480
uh to inform our security strategy and

520
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
better safeguard ourselves

521
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,200
if the answer is no then why are you

522
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,799
even paying attention to it and i know

523
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,280
that's

524
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,720
kind of uh almost inflammatory right

525
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,039
well

526
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,440
i gotta take in this this threat data

527
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,159
well

528
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,159
if it's becoming more cumbersome and

529
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,000
it's not aiding and protecting your

530
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
network i would say

531
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,039
don't pay attention to because it's not

532
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,640
getting you anywhere

533
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,520
you need to be you know proficient at

534
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,159
consuming

535
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,720
that information turning it into uh

536
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,600
something that's

537
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,360
that's actionable that you can actually

538
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,480
posture your network defenses in a uh in

539
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,000
a proficient way

540
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,120
um when we go down this this uh

541
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,799
road we we can then take those blind

542
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,360
spots

543
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,480
uh turn them into just known gaps right

544
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,600
areas and we can start to almost predict

545
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,000
likely avenues of approach for an

546
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
adversary

547
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
that can be used to our benefit in a

548
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,559
number of ways one

549
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,640
obviously those are areas that i should

550
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,000
be monitoring

551
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
these are you know hot spots of

552
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,679
potential activity

553
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,039
but two i can get even you know

554
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,440
sort of counter intelligence you know

555
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
savvy with it

556
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,440
and and uh approach it from the the

557
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
standpoint of

558
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,120
you know implementing honey pots and

559
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,039
honey creds and things like that that

560
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:29,600
will

561
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
you know set off the uh the alarms and

562
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,120
and

563
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,480
you know let me know that there's

564
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,120
something going on within my network

565
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,480
um the the nice thing about approaching

566
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,520
it from this way is

567
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,679
is that what i call top-down security

568
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,000
and and i'll get into that uh here in a

569
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,799
moment

570
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,320
um in uh in a little bit more detail but

571
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,200
to give you the

572
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,799
the high level uh overview uh when we

573
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,159
quantify the the risk right by taking

574
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,000
our threats and our vulnerabilities and

575
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,039
assessing

576
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,480
uh you know the the real impacts

577
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,400
um multiplied by impact we get our risk

578
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,159
and i understand now

579
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,080
where i really need to be focusing my

580
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,400
effort where i need to be prioritizing

581
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,080
uh my monitoring

582
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,600
uh we we start to you know

583
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,039
create a a few scenarios of what will

584
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,240
likely happen

585
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,240
um in doing so we then need to assess

586
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,280
our risk appetite for uh for quantifying

587
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,559
that risk

588
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,640
um that that's really going to be

589
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,320
dependent upon

590
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,720
understanding the type of impact that

591
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,520
would uh

592
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,039
be likely in a given scenario

593
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,919
so when we're when we're going down that

594
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:46,559
road

595
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,640
um i i can't really understand and and i

596
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
can't really communicate

597
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,200
why it's important for me to implement

598
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,280
these safeguards without

599
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,240
comm effectively communicating the level

600
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,280
of impact that

601
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,159
uh that would likely happen and thus

602
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:04,559
it's

603
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,120
it's nearly impossible for me to assess

604
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
and make a case

605
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,919
for our risk appetite how can how can

606
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,039
you make the case

607
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,720
that you shouldn't be

608
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,400
focusing on a certain area when

609
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,960
you have no idea how to to quantify how

610
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,200
impactful the scenario could be

611
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,559
um in intelligence and security

612
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,280
most of the time the the decision makers

613
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,720
are are not going to be the

614
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
practitioners so

615
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,760
make sure you're communicating those

616
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,919
things to uh to identify those

617
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,520
easily solvable gaps

618
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,640
so kind of the the overview why is it so

619
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
important to let the adversary

620
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,960
uh inform our are defensive um

621
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,279
one of the things that that we kind of

622
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,400
take on is

623
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,840
is an approach that uh is is similar to

624
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,400
uh bianco's pyramid of pain i think most

625
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,440
of us are

626
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,120
pretty familiar with it but if you're

627
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,760
not uh it it really

628
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
builds a strong case for why it's

629
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,600
important to focus on

630
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,799
behaviors over indicators of compromise

631
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,760
uh which is you know what many in this

632
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,320
uh

633
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,840
this uh industry refer to

634
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,000
cringingly enough is is threat

635
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,360
intelligence right those

636
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,400
those indicators um intelligence again

637
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,480
with intelligence without analysis

638
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,400
is uh it best information and at worst

639
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,600
uh just data without concept all right

640
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
um so let's take back uh threat

641
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,360
intelligence

642
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,440
um your own thread and tell that you

643
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
generate uh is typically

644
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,720
far more useful um

645
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,960
not to say uh you know plugging those

646
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,080
things in to

647
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,320
your your network security appliances

648
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,279
isn't uh

649
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,279
isn't useful but if you suffer from

650
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,279
alert fatigue like i know that

651
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,400
a lot of organizations do um

652
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,039
then that may be doing more harm than

653
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,159
than good

654
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,360
right um so back to the uh the the

655
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
pyramid of pain

656
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,240
um the idea here that indicators are so

657
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,679
easy to change right signatures ip

658
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,640
addresses

659
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,679
uh domain names the sorts of things that

660
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,559
we see being dynamic you know all the

661
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,200
time

662
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,279
it's riffraff it's something that i

663
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,200
should you know be

664
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,840
paying attention to but more importantly

665
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
it's very very difficult for an

666
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,559
adversary to change those behaviors

667
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,600
why that's so important is because

668
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,720
by analyzing those types of behaviors i

669
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,360
might not

670
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,799
care as much about the ip address or the

671
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,799
signature the payload or even

672
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,000
you know if it's a potential zero day uh

673
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,200
if i'm i'm focusing on the types of

674
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,080
behaviors that would be associated with

675
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,600
potential malicious activity um

676
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,679
the ultimate goal is to cross-reference

677
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,080
the topology of the the network

678
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,640
with the vulnerabilities right to kind

679
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,320
of superimpose the two

680
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,120
over the top of one another to determine

681
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
the likely avenue of approach

682
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,279
um so uh lastly it's important to

683
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,840
understand how these types of attacks

684
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,159
uh take place and the kind of behavioral

685
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:24,960
indicators

686
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
one can expect uh from from each of them

687
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,880
um by doing that and using you know

688
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,480
everybody's favorite uh

689
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,840
framework uh the the attack matrix we

690
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,240
can

691
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
focus on those areas um that

692
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,279
that maybe we're weak in terms of

693
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,080
detection

694
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,240
or more importantly protection

695
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,679
we need to assess essentially whether or

696
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,080
not

697
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,679
uh that that gap can be closed without

698
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,440
impeding usability

699
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,640
um and if we can't close that gap uh are

700
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:00,960
we

701
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,360
able to detect uh behaviors that may be

702
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,320
taking advantage thereof but um

703
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,640
you know in a lot of cases where you

704
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,760
come across

705
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,679
an organization that says hey we can't

706
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,960
we can't close these

707
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,520
these gaps right we need to keep these

708
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,240
things open

709
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,440
for for legacy uh foundation

710
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,559
reasons or whatever else rarely are we

711
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,799
seeing any type of cost benefit analysis

712
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,080
right to

713
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,799
uh really enumerate what the level of

714
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,360
impact

715
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,399
could be uh you know versus

716
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,399
what it's you know why it's important to

717
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,080
keep that that uh

718
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,440
that gap open so um that that's

719
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,559
difficult to do

720
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,720
as a one-off but if we're doing the

721
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,080
legwork up front

722
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,520
to generate a risk analysis

723
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,120
we can more effectively uh assess

724
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,919
you know the the correct avenue of

725
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,080
approach to maybe going around

726
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,640
those vulnerabilities and and ultimately

727
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,840
closing them

728
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,520
all right so uh take in kind of

729
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,240
lending from the uh the pyramid of pain

730
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,720
um

731
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,440
is is taking on the approach of a

732
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,399
top-down

733
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,240
threat-based defense um it's very

734
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,120
uh popular right to start with with

735
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
cyber hygiene and say

736
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,760
we're going to get to to security right

737
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
but starting from the bottom up

738
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,679
um i this is a little bit uh

739
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,600
you know maybe of a different approach

740
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,039
um but

741
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,600
my point being if we're focusing on the

742
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,520
likely attack vectors

743
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,320
uh if we're focusing on where those gaps

744
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,640
are

745
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,960
and then taking the efforts to remediate

746
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,320
those gaps

747
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,840
uh necessarily you get to

748
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,120
to cyber hygiene right and so uh when

749
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,919
we're working

750
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,320
sort of backwards from impact we can

751
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,279
mitigate the most

752
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,240
glaring and and dire issues up front

753
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,000
so for example if if i came into a

754
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
uh a specific uh area and i noticed all

755
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,919
the pipes were leaking and everything

756
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,000
yeah i may need to uh

757
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,679
to think about how are we going to

758
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,440
reroute everything so that

759
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,679
you know we have a more efficient system

760
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,120
and and our pipes aren't

761
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,760
aren't leaking everywhere but uh

762
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,799
obviously the

763
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,200
most critical need right up front is to

764
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,559
stop the leak right

765
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
and so we we develop kind of a yin and

766
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,120
yang a top-down

767
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,000
and bottom-up approach um rather than

768
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,919
just focusing on let's build this

769
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,200
foundation

770
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,320
and do that over the course of months or

771
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,520
years stop the leaks up front right and

772
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:45,919
then

773
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,799
focus on how we how can we better

774
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,960
engineer things to ensure that

775
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,600
these types of problems don't happen

776
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
again

777
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,080
so the the added benefit to this is

778
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,640
a lot of times when we approach the the

779
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,080
academic sort of

780
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,520
cyber hygiene approach uh only is that

781
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,159
when we

782
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,559
are really trying to understand our

783
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,159
network understand our

784
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,120
our impact assessments understand where

785
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,520
the

786
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,399
the real threats lie uh we may be

787
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,480
building towards something that

788
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,600
isn't necessarily uniquely a pattern

789
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,559
after how our network operates right but

790
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,240
when we approach things from

791
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,640
sort of the top down and trying to

792
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,520
assess what

793
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,600
you know the attacks would be what what

794
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,159
the impacts would be

795
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,120
we can get a better idea of how to you

796
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,080
know potentially

797
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,120
engineer our network and and lay out

798
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,279
our uh our approach towards cyber

799
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,720
hygiene so

800
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,080
again it's uh it's a process of of

801
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,320
understanding you know the best way

802
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,600
forward um

803
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
if you can't see how improving your your

804
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,240
cyber governance your asset management

805
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,039
is improving your your security stature

806
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:01,440
again

807
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,720
why why are we doing it right not to say

808
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,080
those things aren't important they're

809
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,840
exceptionally important

810
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,120
but you'll get there and so uh

811
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,719
an example there would be

812
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,840
if if i approach it from the top down

813
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
right the the attack

814
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,679
vectors um maybe initially to understand

815
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,279
what would the impacts be what would a

816
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,279
likely attack vector be

817
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,480
uh i get towards a cyber founder

818
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,360
a security foundation right to address

819
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,799
those gaps

820
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,000
which end up having overlapping

821
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
foundational controls that pertain to

822
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,200
other gaps in coverage

823
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,360
addressing your security challenges

824
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,399
through

825
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,080
risk will lead the way to cyber hygiene

826
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,440
for example if i were to assess

827
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,039
for drive-by compromise

828
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,159
if your browsers were sandboxed and you

829
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,440
answered oh yeah that's

830
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
that's part of our policy that's

831
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,200
enforced um

832
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,080
you know my subsequent question might be

833
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,279
okay do you know

834
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,440
all the assets within your network do

835
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,720
you know every

836
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,960
you know device that is that's currently

837
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,519
attached if the answer is no

838
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,840
well then effectively your your sandbox

839
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,519
browser policy

840
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,640
is is you know not in effect and

841
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,000
in a lot of uh respect so it lets the

842
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,960
uh the security strategist know that oh

843
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,559
we have a lot more work to do

844
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,399
we need to do a lot more diligence

845
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,640
because i can't really

846
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,880
say that that that's something that's uh

847
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,399
in place when

848
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,120
i don't really have visibility over

849
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,200
what's in my network so you get to

850
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,120
to cyber hygiene right it we get to

851
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,960
those foundational levels um necessarily

852
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,399
so again it's it's not uh necessarily

853
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,480
focusing on one over the other but i

854
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:00,960
think

855
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,159
that yin yang approach of uh

856
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,480
really trying to assess what you're

857
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,679
trying to protect

858
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,880
is is maybe a better strategy

859
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,000
um so

860
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,679
when we when we approach uh our our

861
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,760
our risk management we really need to

862
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,880
understand

863
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,360
that threat intelligence needs to play

864
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,159
into it right

865
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,600
needs to inform uh what what those risks

866
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:27,919
are

867
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,360
so uh the nice thing is that

868
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
risk management by a lot of

869
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,080
organizations is already something that

870
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,279
uh you know people use to to assess

871
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,880
maybe their competition

872
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,240
uh uh executives maybe understand those

873
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,720
things

874
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,480
uh already so when i'm making the case

875
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,320
that you know in terms of real dollars

876
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,880
impact levels and saying you know i've

877
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
quantified our risk i've

878
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,279
i've put a number to it i've qualified

879
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,360
i've quantified it

880
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,600
these are things that we need to assess

881
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,960
uh immediately

882
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,200
and if we do that i can bring down our

883
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
risk uh

884
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,079
you know this this percentage wise

885
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,879
uh some you know subsequently this many

886
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,159
dollar wise

887
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,719
becomes easy and an easy call typically

888
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,639
to decide whether i need to accept this

889
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,280
risk

890
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,399
mitigate it transfer it or eliminate it

891
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,918
um so i think this becomes

892
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,000
a way to kind of bridge the gap

893
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,239
as well between those that are tasked

894
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,359
with uh

895
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,280
with protecting our network and those

896
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,879
that are are tasked with

897
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,040
securing it um more importantly in in my

898
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,440
experience there's been a lot of uh

899
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,719
of issues between um the

900
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,839
the or the organizations the the

901
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,879
um i.t department even the security

902
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,599
department

903
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,320
and then potentially threat intelligence

904
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,119
teams

905
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,760
that uh are meant to go out and and

906
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
collect information

907
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,160
and report on it to uh to determine

908
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,000
where we need to be spending our time

909
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,680
and and i find there's a lot of

910
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,760
communication issues even between those

911
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,640
teams

912
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,839
uh you know the the internal guys not

913
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,839
really knowing what to ask for

914
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,960
or you know going and getting that

915
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,200
information themselves as best they can

916
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,839
and then on

917
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,480
the other side threat intelligence teams

918
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,079
not necessarily knowing what

919
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,560
information to uh to relinquish i've

920
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
seen that in a number of case

921
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,960
um so it can lead to a lot of

922
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,000
hypotheticals

923
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,119
right uh risk risk teams

924
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,320
basically chasing ghosts and saying you

925
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,160
know what what should we be concerned

926
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,000
with well if you've got a a common uh

927
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,119
conduit between those two organizations

928
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,200
that information should be coming in

929
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,960
right to let you know the things that

930
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
you should be concerned with and

931
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,720
how to it's not just a question of

932
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,040
determining what the risks are but

933
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,119
determining how to action those risks

934
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,560
whether it's something that we

935
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,800
we that's acceptable or something we

936
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,320
need to prioritize

937
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,000
transfer eliminate so on and so forth so

938
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,720
uh there needs to be that process right

939
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,680
that can

940
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,040
um serve as is that uh common

941
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,200
you know platform so um

942
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,560
you know there's been a uh uh

943
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,680
a lot of different uh risk rating

944
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,599
foundations that that have been out

945
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,480
there but i i like to uh

946
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,240
to use the uh oh sorry about that uh we

947
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,480
we like to use the owasp risk rating

948
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,040
methodology as an introductory platform

949
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,000
and the reason why

950
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,400
it's very very simple but it's also very

951
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,680
very malleable

952
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,760
um it allows people to

953
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,119
approach their their risk factors in a

954
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,079
unique way

955
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,560
so it gives you kind of a foundation

956
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,000
something that you can use

957
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,800
on the front end to uh to determine the

958
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,520
different

959
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,800
factors that play into likelihood and

960
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,079
impact

961
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,640
but when i say it's malleable i mean you

962
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,839
can tweak it to

963
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,920
to yourself right you can weight things

964
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,400
differently as well

965
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,680
so by going down this route it gives you

966
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,240
that

967
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,000
introductory sort of foundation right

968
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,920
so it's important to understand risk but

969
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,839
again when we look at something like

970
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:30,400
this

971
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,320
you may be asking yourself what am i

972
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,000
assessing right

973
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,640
i don't necessarily know what kind of

974
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,359
event

975
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,960
i'm supposed to go in and assess um

976
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,680
and that can be an issue and and one of

977
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,079
the

978
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,520
things that that i would recommend

979
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,599
is that you uh you utilize the attack

980
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,320
framework to go down that road and start

981
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,599
looking at that

982
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,880
uh as a template of sorts

983
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,520
to determine what are we at risk for for

984
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,200
all these different techniques these

985
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,240
tactics and

986
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,079
you know where are our crown jewels so

987
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,359
on and so forth

988
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,839
um so i'll show that here in uh in a

989
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,599
moment

990
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,960
so one of the things that uh that i

991
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,920
put together a few years ago was to kind

992
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,480
of illustrate that relationship

993
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,040
uh between the the internal teams and

994
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,839
and sort of

995
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,040
uh the external threat intelligence

996
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,839
uh team and and put that together in in

997
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,160
what i call the proactive cyber defense

998
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,560
cycle really on the front end

999
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,920
it allows for you know

1000
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,839
risk assessments vulnerability

1001
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,760
assessments security scans things like

1002
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,880
that to identify

1003
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,760
risks and kind of plot that into a

1004
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,560
common risk

1005
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,400
profile uh that then serves as

1006
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,760
as that common conduit for

1007
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,599
all the the the people in the

1008
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,240
organization to understand

1009
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,480
what things they need to be focusing on

1010
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,599
um

1011
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,640
so once that that information is put in

1012
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,079
it gives sort of the

1013
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,760
the threat intelligence side of the

1014
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,920
house even if it's not

1015
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,240
a different team just kind of switching

1016
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,040
gears

1017
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,160
to go out and employ the intelligence

1018
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,200
cycle to

1019
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,440
determine okay now that we understand

1020
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,760
that that these vulnerabilities

1021
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,280
uh exist let's use our our intelligence

1022
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,760
methods of going out and collecting the

1023
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,800
information

1024
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,920
of exploiting it analyzing it and then

1025
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,079
subsequently disseminating and reporting

1026
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,040
our findings

1027
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,280
into that common risk profile to

1028
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,079
determine

1029
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,200
how pervasive the threat is okay so

1030
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,200
by by uh focusing on

1031
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,480
on things like the ease of exploitation

1032
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,440
um some of the uh just to jump back here

1033
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,640
um

1034
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,320
you know the threat agent factors that

1035
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,839
they talk about the risk rating

1036
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,160
methodology skill level

1037
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,359
uh motive opportunity size and again you

1038
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,200
can change those things but those give

1039
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,680
you

1040
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,400
um an idea of what are some of the

1041
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,240
things you need to focus on right

1042
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,359
on the uh on the threat side once that

1043
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,920
goes into that common risk profile

1044
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,760
um now we're able to sort of quantify

1045
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,800
you know how how pervasive these these

1046
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,599
issues are

1047
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,560
right especially if we focus on impact

1048
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,480
first and kind of work our way

1049
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,680
backwards right that sort of top-down uh

1050
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,800
assessment um in doing so we can then

1051
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,599
evaluate our risk um this is a common

1052
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,480
place for

1053
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,680
for us to discuss what our

1054
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,040
um you know potential uh uh

1055
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,599
evaluation and treatment plan is is

1056
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,560
gonna be

1057
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,680
um whether or not we need to

1058
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,160
make meaningful remediations into

1059
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,680
closing some of these gaps

1060
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,119
and what our priorities are right and so

1061
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,160
um in the the bottom corner is a you

1062
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,839
know just a dashboard we've built for

1063
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,319
one of our customers just an example

1064
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,200
it quantifies risk it quantifies the

1065
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,720
most likely uh

1066
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,359
impact method and then for each of the

1067
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,400
individual uh

1068
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,280
techniques and or uh tactics within the

1069
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,680
attack

1070
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,359
framework um how likely each individual

1071
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,240
technique is

1072
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,920
and so i'll i'll show you how we kind of

1073
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,359
heat map that out here

1074
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,720
all right so um

1075
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,599
jumping forward here uh kind of again

1076
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,760
lending from our our pyramid of pain

1077
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,720
focusing on the behaviors um we can get

1078
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,520
to

1079
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,480
where we are able to kind of heat map

1080
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,880
out

1081
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,200
our our navigator and and the visuals

1082
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,079
great right

1083
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,400
um but it's only as good as the analysis

1084
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,560
underneath and we're by no means

1085
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,079
the only ones that would heat map

1086
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,599
something like this out

1087
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,040
um i know you know cyber war dogs done a

1088
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,599
ton of work on this on the the detection

1089
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,480
side

1090
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,839
um there's been a lot of approaches what

1091
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,520
what i'm advocating here

1092
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,160
is if we are using this as kind of the

1093
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,079
confluence between

1094
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,720
assessing um you know our

1095
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,760
vulnerabilities

1096
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,040
and then assessing uh uh how

1097
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,160
pervasive an attacker is going to be um

1098
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,839
those are the areas that are gonna show

1099
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,200
up in in red

1100
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,079
right and then you can build multiple

1101
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,480
layers so if you go to the attack

1102
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,119
navigator and there's a link there as

1103
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,079
well

1104
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,760
you can start to build your scoring

1105
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,240
model with with color coding

1106
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,440
in this way but you can also build

1107
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,920
additional layers so you can focus on

1108
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,240
what are just the internal weaknesses

1109
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,000
and then you can focus on maybe what are

1110
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,560
the external threats based on how

1111
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,760
pervasive they are how many uh uh

1112
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,480
examples have been given in the past for

1113
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,720
for those types of techniques or you can

1114
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,599
focus on

1115
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,800
one particular adversary if if you uh

1116
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,160
if you want um and then basically

1117
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,319
superimpose the two over one another and

1118
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,839
into one master uh

1119
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,960
uh framework and in doing so um you

1120
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,000
start to get those

1121
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,800
those likely avenues of approach uh

1122
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,560
those areas in red right those are the

1123
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,839
areas where i'm weak

1124
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,119
where the adversary's strong um

1125
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,440
you're able to calculate your your risk

1126
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,520
level um by assessing that that

1127
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,560
likelihood

1128
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,640
that likelihood a lot of what goes into

1129
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,400
that is how pervasive the

1130
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,440
the threat is uh and how weak you are

1131
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,000
right

1132
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,920
and then the impact which is so

1133
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,280
important right this gets me to

1134
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,079
likelihood but

1135
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,119
impact the nice thing is that uh in the

1136
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:47,680
last

1137
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,880
year mitre added in an impact um

1138
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,400
column as well an impact technique um

1139
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,599
or technic tactic um

1140
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,599
in in going through and assessing the

1141
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,640
likelihood of those

1142
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,680
impacts you can also assess how

1143
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,160
how big of an issue would it be if these

1144
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,079
sorts of things were happen

1145
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,599
were to happen and in doing so

1146
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,720
you can kind of work backwards to

1147
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,040
building out those those likely attack

1148
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,359
vectors

1149
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,599
so your internal risk assessment can

1150
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,760
focus on the types of uh

1151
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,680
opportunities that are out there the

1152
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,520
current vulnerabilities

1153
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,720
gaps in protection um your attack

1154
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,599
surface i

1155
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,599
i take uh something kind of lending from

1156
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,680
a project management process called

1157
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,880
critical path

1158
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,680
right what would the critical path to uh

1159
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,640
to gaining your

1160
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,000
your most impactful uh event um

1161
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,760
and then work your way backwards from

1162
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,960
there your cyber governance your ability

1163
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,720
to detect certain things

1164
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,160
those all may go to the the risk side

1165
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,240
uh conversely on the threat side how

1166
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,839
prevalent is the attack

1167
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,359
what kind of capabilities are are uh

1168
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,319
you know are are present in a potential

1169
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,520
adversary

1170
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,400
um the ease of exploitation how how

1171
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,720
skillful does an adversary have to be

1172
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,440
any recent activity um that we've seen

1173
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,960
observed activity

1174
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,160
um you know doing that analysis on our

1175
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,720
our scans to say you know we've

1176
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,960
identified a lot of potential issues a

1177
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,400
lot of vulnerabilities

1178
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,280
let's look uh externally and see how

1179
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,800
pervasive the threats are

1180
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
to those those types of vulnerabilities

1181
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,280
and then hopefully with a common

1182
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,040
platform whether it be

1183
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,000
you know a platform that somebody is has

1184
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,400
built

1185
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,240
like like us or that you could do

1186
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,560
yourself or just start with

1187
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,280
a spreadsheet or or someplace that you

1188
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,680
can have that common conversation

1189
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,800
and enumerate where those those likely

1190
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,160
attack vectors are going to be

1191
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,119
so that kind of covers the the approach

1192
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,319
feel free to

1193
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,040
to reach out to us or me for any

1194
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,800
additional information

1195
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,920
um other than that that kind of uh

1196
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,800
covers the uh the ins and outs of a

1197
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,560
threat-based defense model as

1198
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,839
as we see it

1199
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,040
[Music]

1200
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,160
all right claps

1201
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,440
yeah you're supposed to do like this

1202
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,760
dave this that's this is how we do it

1203
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,040
now

1204
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,359
i will i will get better i'll get little

1205
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,480
symbols is what i'll get

1206
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,839
so all right cool very good well i just

1207
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,440
one thing that always strikes out at me

1208
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,000
is that

1209
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,680
in presentations that i've seen of this

1210
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,440
nature

1211
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,839
you know especially with the triangle of

1212
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:46,720
pain

1213
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,200
we talk about how it's harder for them

1214
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,839
to

1215
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,960
change their behaviors but when we share

1216
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,240
information about them

1217
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,160
i don't know that there is a format that

1218
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,720
you can share that is behavior-based

1219
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,200
unless you're thinking sigma and i feel

1220
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,359
like sigma is extremely

1221
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,520
bad yeah you know what you're you're

1222
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,440
illustrating something that uh

1223
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,760
has been uh i don't want to call it a

1224
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,440
complaint i don't know what else to call

1225
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:11,680
it

1226
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,640
but uh the the organization we've

1227
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,440
definitely

1228
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,640
tried to work towards this is uh those

1229
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,079
that start to

1230
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,440
map um you know

1231
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,119
cves constantly to a common repository

1232
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,480
to attack uh

1233
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,440
techniques i think is is gonna you know

1234
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,359
make quite the splash because that is

1235
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,119
kind of lacking right as we're still

1236
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,559
so indicator focused and uh

1237
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,200
that's where we get most of our data but

1238
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,200
is anybody mapping those things and i

1239
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,559
think you're starting to see it a little

1240
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,520
bit more

1241
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,599
uh some of the the newer threat

1242
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,599
intelligence platforms

1243
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,160
um that come out as i think they they

1244
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,599
try to

1245
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,800
you know make that that uh distinction

1246
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,400
between the indicator

1247
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,440
and the actual technique but there's

1248
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,200
still a long way to go

1249
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,839
on that front for sure cool

1250
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,680
all right bryson i believe you have

1251
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,160
announcements

1252
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,400
yes i am going to pull up

1253
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,599
my screen here thank you so much james

1254
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:20,880
that was

1255
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,160
great appreciate it thank you
