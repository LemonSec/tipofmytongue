1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,720
wait so as that springs up yeah so i'm

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,759
i'm talking about

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,440
uh blue team but blue team from a design

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,000
thinking lens i've been doing a lot of

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,400
uh work in this area a lot of research a

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
lot of conversations with folks that i i

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,199
mentor and

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,320
collaborate with and you know

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,160
not going to surprise anyone what we're

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,920
doing

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,640
in security just uh hasn't been working

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,680
all that well

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,760
so i've got a slightly different way to

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,119
build a blue team slightly different way

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,719
of thinking about defense

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,960
uh that i would say would uh would be

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,840
much better

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
we'll see if people agree and for for

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,239
context before

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,920
before he gets into it so i can give the

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,520
actual introduction

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,039
he is an advisory ciso for duo security

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,760
uh he has been responsible for it and

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,160
i.t

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
security in the health care and

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
financial services verticals

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
he's led advisory and assessment

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
practices in cyber security consulting

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,960
firms so an excellent person to discuss

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,039
these matters with us

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,239
and we're actually doing something a

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,519
little different and special with this

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,320
one so

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,640
uh wolfgang's the first part we then

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,880
have red team design right afterward

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,240
with cedric owens

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
so uh book if you could share how your

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,759
uh the two of you are going to be doing

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,799
this

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,119
yeah no i i'm so glad you mentioned that

41
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,000
bryson so

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
uh you know i'll be talking about the

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,880
blue team perspective but of course

44
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,040
uh any anyone can tell you what's worse

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
than no security a false

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
sense of security which is exactly what

47
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
you get if you're not testing these

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,159
controls

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,320
and we've we've talked about pen testing

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
forever you know the very first pen test

51
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,240
was in the 70s they're like i wonder if

52
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,920
we could demonstrate that things could

53
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,360
be broken into and

54
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,799
spoiler alert they could and we've done

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
this for what decades now can you break

56
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,040
in oh yeah he broke in okay great

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,479
we'll uh we'll become more compliant

58
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,200
next time what's really fascinating with

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,719
what cedric's going to talk about is

60
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,119
moving from that very reactive

61
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,159
approach to partnering the red team with

62
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
the blue team in a way that

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
can give us some assurance that what

64
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,840
we're doing actually is working

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,120
cool very excited for it

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,480
so with that should i take it away is

67
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,040
there any

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,679
any other setup great also

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
thank you so much i've got chat up

70
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,400
um so as uh as we go through here

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,560
you know folks are on the line feel free

72
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
to throw questions

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
in and i will answer as i can

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,280
um as already mentioned i am with

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
duo security i'm an advisor you see so

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
there and for the longest time

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,120
you know i've i've been very excited and

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
very proud to take the tron

79
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,680
approach right i fight for the user

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
which sounds good i think it sounds good

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
um maybe you agree maybe disagree

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,480
however

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,280
the reality is is that uh those of us

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,760
fighting

85
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,120
for the user haven't necessarily

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,239
done the best job of it i think i would

87
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:10,640
uh

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
be remiss if i didn't admit that i spent

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
about 10 years solving the wrong problem

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,319
i say you know what we need to build

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,319
things like a castle secure

92
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,000
organizations like a castle that's what

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
we should do defense and depth all these

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,879
layers

95
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,519
and uh it sounds sounds good except for

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,640
when you realize that

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,239
castles took two three decades

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,360
to build consumed around 40 of the the

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,080
income the revenue of the kingdom

100
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
not exactly a good model for cyber

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
security when we have to put up

102
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
something now

103
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
see also during the pandemic when we all

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,799
scrambled uh and we have to do something

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:45,120
with

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,920
point you know percent of the i.t budget

107
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
let alone the revenue of the company

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
so maybe that's not a good approach

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,280
another approach that we all

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
thought about is you know if we just

111
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
speak the language of the business right

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,000
the business is speaking

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
uh cyber security we just speak the

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,879
language of the business we will get

115
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,239
through to them and they will listen to

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
us and they will go you are right

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
we should address these risks have some

118
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,519
money

119
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,720
go forth and do uh the reality is

120
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,239
that hasn't paid off either uh in part i

121
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,280
think we got

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,519
took a very technical domain cyber

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,320
security

124
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,880
and went ah business talking about risk

125
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,680
okay cool

126
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
we'll talk about risk because you know

127
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
we're too too technical

128
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
and then immediately what do we do we

129
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
make it incredibly technical with fair

130
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,280
and active

131
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
and uh let's talk about sle and ari and

132
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
arrow and again we've got that glazed

133
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
overlook

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,639
the other thing is intriguing about risk

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,880
management is uh and i think about this

136
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,199
is

137
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,280
cheeseburger risk management right we we

138
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,320
all know you shouldn't eat the

139
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,080
cheeseburger

140
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
the cheeseburger is so tasty so you eat

141
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,199
the cheeseburgers until you

142
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,080
have a heart attack uh and then then hey

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,680
you know we're getting healthy now

144
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,160
we've been breached we've seen the light

145
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,840
we're going to double down

146
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,320
for a year maybe two if we're lucky and

147
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,479
then we're right back to our bad habits

148
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,840
so i'm not entirely sure that risk

149
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,759
management has been a good approach for

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
blue team and protecting the user either

151
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,880
so we don't okay fine what we need to do

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
what we need to do is

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
just tell users what to think right if

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
we just give them the information

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
they would uh they will go forth and

156
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,320
secure things

157
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,440
very optimistic back to risk management

158
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,000
we've seen how

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,400
well that works in in health just tell

160
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,520
people not to eat cheeseburgers it's

161
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,039
cool

162
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,039
or the pandemic has given us so many

163
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,400
different examples

164
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,919
uh just can make sure that they got an

165
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
awareness yeah that that worked really

166
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
well for social distancing and masks

167
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,000
but somehow we think this will work in

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
security right if we just create a

169
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,639
culture if we just

170
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
share the knowledge so they know what to

171
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,280
do things will get better

172
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
spoiler alert it hasn't part of the

173
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,039
interesting thing about

174
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,440
uh culture is there's so much more to it

175
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,560
than just saying hey here's something

176
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,080
good to do

177
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
so we we fight for the user but of

178
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,199
course at the same time we've got

179
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,039
so many different examples of blaming

180
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,039
the user for bad security

181
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,720
and i would argue it's not the user's

182
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
fault we'll get more into that later but

183
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
uh along this path as i've been trying

184
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,479
to figure out different ways to

185
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,600
to improve how the blue team

186
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,160
is gone i really need help i really need

187
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,039
help on this so

188
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,479
i'm going to have a couple slides

189
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,000
throughout this talk where i'm asking

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,759
for help here's one example

191
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,520
if you've got a good like super dave

192
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,039
story right uh

193
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
where where dave or denise it doesn't

194
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,639
matter the gender really doesn't matter

195
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,280
the person

196
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,919
have you got a good user story where

197
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,319
they've

198
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,639
saved the day please share that with me

199
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,400
i'm i'm collecting those

200
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
and i want to uh to do something with it

201
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,919
but

202
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,199
let's talk about how i've been

203
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,880
describing the problem today

204
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
first off in terms of of blue team and

205
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,479
in terms of i.t

206
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,720
we're creating experiences all the time

207
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,160
we don't necessarily think about it that

208
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
way if i uh if

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,759
i stand up the ability for a user to go

210
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,800
ahead and use

211
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,840
telephony for

212
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
multi-factor sounds good

213
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
what experience have we just enabled for

214
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
the criminals

215
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
seeing massive amounts of phone scam

216
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,759
fraud

217
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,759
across all sorts of mfa vendors for the

218
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,039
past couple years

219
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,560
uh because when we did this we thought

220
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
only about the user experience

221
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
conversely if i go you know what i am

222
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
going to

223
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,560
i'm going to create this fantastic

224
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,440
logging

225
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,680
and i'm going to make sure that uh you

226
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,639
know we've got

227
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,240
full visibility and all this data so

228
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,919
that we can react and that we've got the

229
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,520
ability to get into the response yada

230
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,479
yada all right good

231
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
good blue team secops

232
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
we don't necessarily think about the

233
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
experience that

234
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
creates for the workforce who now views

235
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
us as big brother and wait a minute how

236
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,720
do you know what i was browsing

237
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
what do you mean you're monitoring all

238
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,479
my clicks

239
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,120
so anything we do in terms of security

240
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
is a creating experience

241
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,240
now what's fascinating about this

242
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
from a behavioral economics perspective

243
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,400
is we can we can actually pivot and

244
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,960
control

245
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,039
two different points on the experiences

246
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,000
we create

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
and this will become more important as

248
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
we talk about both usability and

249
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,440
defensibility

250
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,280
we can we can pivot on the paths they

251
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,199
take right what is the step-by-step

252
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,879
approach that someone's doing to

253
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,440
complete work or step-by-step approach

254
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,199
that some criminal is doing

255
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,159
to break into our networks uh or we can

256
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,279
think about the choices we

257
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
they make um and this last one can

258
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,719
really get me

259
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,640
you know i've got like six different

260
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,719
multi-factor authenticators

261
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,440
i got three different cloud services uh

262
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
i gotta remember my vpn are connecting

263
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,800
directly

264
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,120
um we've got several different document

265
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
stores and i never seem to be on the

266
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
right one right i oh i need the doc

267
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
and i think it needs the vpn and i think

268
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
it's over here but really it was

269
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
sharepoint no wait a minute it's google

270
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
docs the windom it's this other thing

271
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,519
and do i have the right anything who

272
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,279
knows right choices that people make

273
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,519
so there's some ways from a defensive

274
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,040
perspective we can think about this we

275
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,959
can think about the number of steps

276
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,200
uh the familiarity of each step if

277
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,240
you've seen past

278
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,000
talks you've heard me talk about when

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
work looks like work

280
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,959
work gets done this is what i'm talking

281
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,959
about with familiarity

282
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,560
so critical if you're trying to get

283
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
adoption for a new control

284
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,600
if you're trying to get um you know your

285
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
it team to run some tests for you

286
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,240
i remember early days i had an i.t team

287
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,279
i'm like oh yeah just

288
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,120
you know fire up cali and run these

289
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,519
tests and they're like oh

290
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,640
those are hacker tools we're exposing

291
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,519
our network

292
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,040
oh my gosh all right um will you use

293
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,240
your scheduler to

294
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,399
run this simple powershell script oh

295
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,480
yeah we use powershell to admin all the

296
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
time okay good

297
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
thank you right the familiarity often

298
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,680
determines

299
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,600
how easy or difficult it is to follow

300
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
that path

301
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
and then the friction we talked way too

302
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,399
much about friction but adding friction

303
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,360
removing friction

304
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,200
how difficult is it to go from step to

305
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,519
step

306
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,399
on the choices side choice architecture

307
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,120
and nudges

308
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,640
as a whole domain which could be

309
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,959
explored way greater detail than

310
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,800
a half hour talk but things like the

311
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,720
number of choices predictability of each

312
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,839
choice

313
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,160
so i was doing a uh pen test

314
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,040
and uh my guy was doing the scan and he

315
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,240
kept getting kicked out

316
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,320
and every time you would like follow his

317
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,920
normal predictable path like i chose

318
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
this i chose that which is this

319
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
he would run into a roadblock and what

320
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,480
it was

321
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
so bloody clever of the defense team to

322
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,399
to build this

323
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,519
in uh what it was was they were looking

324
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,959
for 404s

325
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,959
they were looking for 500 so if there's

326
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,640
a server error or missing page they knew

327
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,680
hey someone's

328
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
someone's scanning and when that

329
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,360
happened they would throw up some decoys

330
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,120
or they would block the session for

331
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,399
several minutes

332
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,240
and what would ordinarily be like an

333
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
hour worth of effort

334
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
to enumerate and figure out the site

335
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,040
that we're

336
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,320
you know getting into turned into uh

337
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
my my pen tester who was hands on the

338
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
keyboard basically working

339
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,959
over the weekend and just ah so

340
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,839
frustrated but

341
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,240
as a defender i love that feeling

342
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
and finally the cognitive load right how

343
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
much are requiring them to

344
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,160
think about when they're making these

345
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
choices these are some of the pivot

346
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
points

347
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,279
that we can think about on each

348
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,680
individual step

349
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
and it's those individual pieces that

350
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
really matter right having fewer steps

351
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,079
we're trying to defend

352
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,720
easier move from step to step or

353
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,399
conversely increasing

354
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,800
and adding things up you know adam

355
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
shostak once had this quote from the

356
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
book the new school of information

357
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,800
security

358
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
which is an old book about the new

359
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,360
school but you should definitely read it

360
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,160
if you haven't

361
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
uh where he said hey amateurs study

362
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,839
cryptography and professionals study

363
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,200
economics

364
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,440
love that quote at the time why because

365
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,639
as much as i like

366
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,480
you know encryption standards and data

367
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,320
protection and the math

368
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
just the math kills me so that quote i

369
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,519
would argue

370
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,320
you know in today's era when we're doing

371
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
blue team design and blue team thinking

372
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,920
we really need to be thinking more about

373
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
behavior economics

374
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
which is those paths those choices what

375
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,160
causes people to make good decisions

376
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
what causes people to adopt the controls

377
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,079
right i would say professionals

378
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,959
study behavior economics with um with

379
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,160
apologies to show stack

380
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
knowing of course i think show stack

381
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,079
might have got this from somewhere else

382
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,720
but first step and thing i would leave

383
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,680
you with

384
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,079
is this idea of behavior economics

385
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,680
choices and steps

386
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
as applied to defense and offense

387
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,639
and as a as a help wanted if you are

388
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,160
or know someone who's a student an

389
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
organizational psych who's working on a

390
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,560
capstone project or a thesis who wants

391
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,839
to collaborate please

392
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,839
get in touch talking to a few folks

393
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,279
right now we're really finding some

394
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,720
intriguing ways

395
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,240
to increase security in ways that are

396
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,519
likable by users that people enjoy

397
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,800
so for example 502 with passer-less

398
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,160
no password easy to get in simple

399
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,320
on the back end increase the security in

400
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
ways that are transparent and don't add

401
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
steps or friction to users how do you do

402
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,560
that well

403
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,440
you do that by applying risk analytics

404
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,360
um looking at the context and conditions

405
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,200
of the authentication you get the idea

406
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,160
so we can do some really cool things in

407
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
the realm of behavior psych

408
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,800
in behavior economics if you or someone

409
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,600
you love

410
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
is suffering and what i mean it's in one

411
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,040
of these programs

412
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,120
send them my way would be happy to uh to

413
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
collaborate

414
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,760
but my my main point in this first

415
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,600
section is this

416
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,320
perhaps the the real security is the the

417
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,399
steps that we take out right the bricks

418
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,000
we eat along the way

419
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
uh the the areas where we reduce what we

420
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,360
ask of our users and in conjunction

421
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,320
drive up adoption and drive up using the

422
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,680
controls that we're providing

423
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
all right so that's my my premise of how

424
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,680
to define the problem of

425
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,320
blue team security these days uh let's

426
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,160
talk a little bit about the definition

427
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,079
of design thinking it all goes back to

428
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,519
this guy this is the

429
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,000
original computer mouse douglas

430
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,519
engelbart's computer mouse douglas

431
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
single-part of the mother of all demos

432
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,360
where he invented so many different

433
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,560
things in computers

434
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
he actually wasn't too mechanically

435
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,199
inclined i'm told this uh this

436
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
device was manufactured for him uh

437
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,240
with the whittling knife as you can see

438
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,480
it's carved out of wood

439
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
so freaking cool what uh early

440
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
technologists were doing

441
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,760
but inglobar thought of the mouse

442
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,800
as being a precision instrument he

443
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
thought of the mouse as being like

444
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,639
music and what that led to was a

445
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,560
six-month course

446
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
and using the mouse later versions look

447
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,079
like the one on the left

448
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,600
the one on the right is actually a chord

449
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
structure again his mental frame right

450
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,320
his metaphor

451
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
was make things look like a musical

452
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
instrument and and people will play

453
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,199
and it required six months for early

454
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,720
students working with englebart to

455
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
master these tools

456
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,800
to control the early computers so of

457
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
course xerox sees this and they're like

458
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,440
you know we like the mouse

459
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,759
not too groovy on the whole uh cord

460
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,480
system

461
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
not really working for me in 1972

462
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,320
xerox park comes out with this version

463
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,839
of the mouse

464
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,360
this guy very expensive xerox's version

465
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,959
was a precision engineering instrument

466
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,959
you can see it's got a medical trackball

467
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,480
it's easily disassembled

468
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,079
they had a maintenance team an

469
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,279
engineering maintenance team that would

470
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,839
go around and service these things

471
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,079
open them up clean them realign them

472
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,440
make sure that they went through

473
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
diagnostic put them back together on a

474
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
weekly basis

475
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,120
can you imagine on modernity if we had

476
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
to go around check everyone's mouse

477
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
every week

478
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,040
so of course that gets to the the apple

479
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,800
mouse and steve jobs is oftentimes

480
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,639
credited for this it was actually a

481
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,320
company called ideo that

482
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,560
uh did the work or originally the

483
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,759
designers

484
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,279
turned into a company called ideo that

485
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,880
did the original work

486
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,839
uh on the uh the apple mouse so when

487
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,880
they did this

488
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,680
they spent a ton of time looking at how

489
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,199
people were using the mouse

490
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,880
uh or would use it right not as a

491
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,320
musical instrument but actually how

492
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,279
people thought

493
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
they spend a ton of time following a

494
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,720
design thinking process

495
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,399
where they empathize they did field

496
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,920
research they figured out what they

497
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,360
click should be they figured out what

498
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,399
the weight should be

499
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,759
they figured out where it was sticking

500
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,839
where it wasn't and uh

501
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,880
and they followed this approach to

502
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,720
define a bunch of different prototypes

503
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,880
and come up with a new and better way of

504
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,240
controlling the computer

505
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,639
um there's uh this has been now been

506
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,519
codified in

507
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,120
ideo's design thinking process i

508
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,199
actually have this poster on my wall

509
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
over there which you guys can't see but

510
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,160
under all my study i want you to compare

511
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,000
and contrast that with itil

512
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,720
which so many of us follow um we're

513
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,160
gonna we're gonna catalog we're gonna do

514
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,439
an sla we're gonna make sure we get

515
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,400
capacity

516
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,520
some point in time we'll bring in

517
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,439
security and they'll thumbs up at the

518
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,160
last minute

519
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
you think about how a lot of these

520
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,359
services are

521
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,319
brought together they end up being very

522
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:26,959
expensive

523
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,720
they end up having a lot of steps a lot

524
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,160
of complexity for the users

525
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,280
which is why people opt out i was having

526
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,440
a conversation around uh

527
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,320
around webex and zoom right having these

528
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
meetings

529
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
like yeah our concern is you know people

530
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,039
might share information

531
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
oh that's about concern yeah so we're

532
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,240
blocking all of it

533
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,679
and we're turning off chat and we're

534
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,679
turning off file share and we're making

535
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,799
sure and like wait

536
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,200
hey you got to go through four steps and

537
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,520
use a custom browser to launch your

538
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,840
web meetings like yeah yeah because it's

539
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,799
secure

540
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,760
groovy um where's the empathy in the

541
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,720
inside right

542
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
and what about the cost if you look at

543
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
the the apple mouse

544
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,360
uh it was 25 compared to the xerox mouse

545
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
which is 400

546
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
it's about three times inflation so

547
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,559
about 75 dollars in today's

548
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,360
uh math as opposed to what would be

549
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,799
around 1200

550
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,679
and then on the on the time side you'll

551
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,440
watch early steve jobs like oh you could

552
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,039
stone and use this in minutes

553
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,480
and then today it's like of course you

554
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
could you sit down and use a computer

555
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,720
what's it

556
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
but think about englebart again right

557
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
think about that it engineering approach

558
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,640
that we have now brought into security

559
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,400
there was a six-month course compared to

560
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
six minutes incredibly

561
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,600
different way of doing things

562
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,919
the way we get there i believe in terms

563
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,240
of setting up blue team defenses

564
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,600
is having the business me and having the

565
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,520
security smee

566
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,919
is great security's me highly focused on

567
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
security business me how they focused on

568
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,559
business right so

569
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
your financial services person and the

570
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,360
the person in charge of

571
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,799
um compliance for that process

572
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,720
of course we know today that we need

573
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
security champions

574
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
someone within the business who cares

575
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,919
about security someone in the business

576
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,559
who

577
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,960
uh is advocating for what the process

578
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,000
should be

579
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,760
i would argue too and this is the part

580
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,440
that oftentimes gets overlooked

581
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,919
we also need a security advocate so if

582
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,760
we've got a

583
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,280
blue team of 50 people and we've got a

584
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
business unit of 50 people

585
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,480
we've got two or three uh security

586
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
champions that were uh you know

587
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,799
encouraging and coaching and managing up

588
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,679
and then we also have a security

589
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,679
advocate that works to understand that

590
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,880
business unit

591
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,400
and what are the security advocate and

592
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,320
champion do they do what we almost

593
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,919
never do in security they find the

594
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,600
bricks that can be eated

595
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,720
they find the types of controls that can

596
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,559
be simplified or removed so

597
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,000
the business can be more effective so

598
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,080
they can reduce friction so we

599
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,120
can encourage uh adoption of controls is

600
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
that last mile

601
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,679
concern so my

602
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,919
uh my call to action here if anyone

603
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,000
wants to help me as i'm looking for

604
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,840
stories of design thinking specifically

605
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
security empathy

606
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,760
empathy is not something that uh from an

607
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,440
engineering perspective

608
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,679
as a discipline as a field we

609
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,200
particularly excelled at today

610
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,039
all right point three let's talk about

611
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,080
how this looks let's suppose you are

612
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,640
your your business functional area is uh

613
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,679
development

614
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,480
uh and uh you know your security team

615
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,240
cares about absec

616
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
orchestrating and putting in place

617
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,480
telemetry and control so the devops

618
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,080
process is working right

619
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,039
you get the idea so one day you know the

620
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,480
security team

621
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,240
sitting next to the devops team they

622
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,120
overhear a developer

623
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
developer's like look we got the sprint

624
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,320
coming up before we

625
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
we do our stand up i'm gonna go just

626
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,640
take a walk around the building

627
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
and uh teammate's like yeah it sounds

628
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
good but this isn't supposed to rain

629
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
and that's that's when security jumps

630
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,840
into action right we're like yes

631
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,600
we've got this we've got you we want

632
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,880
something that will keep rain off you we

633
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,159
want something that won't blow away

634
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,559
what if someone drops something off the

635
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,640
roof i saw an article

636
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,520
the other day on reddit where right and

637
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
that is how we end up with controls that

638
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,880
look like this

639
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,960
here carry this around you'll be fine

640
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,320
it'll be it'll be fine just

641
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,679
just go um trust me uh by the way this

642
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,120
is from the uncomfortable so

643
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,159
shout out to them when we

644
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,960
think about that path what we're looking

645
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,799
at is

646
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,960
making uh use of behavior journey map

647
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,840
here's the

648
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,880
the process the users follow um figuring

649
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,640
out the controls we need to apply

650
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,720
that process and then again working to

651
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,559
reduce steps working to reduce choices

652
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,360
working to simplify from the red team

653
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
perspective we want to do something a

654
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,559
little bit opposite

655
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,320
threat modeling to figure out the path

656
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
that they're going to take

657
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,120
but then figuring out the tactics and

658
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,080
mapping those

659
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,000
minor attack framework is the way to do

660
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,320
this cedric will be going to this a

661
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,280
little bit more

662
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
in depth and then we're going to reverse

663
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,720
those things right because we want

664
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,799
users to opt in we want criminals to opt

665
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,640
out so we're going to increase steps

666
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
uh we're going to increase choices we're

667
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,080
going to complicate the process

668
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
so we're going to do that in a way that

669
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,720
frustrates the red team if we're

670
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,520
successful

671
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,679
because that is our our goal is to

672
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,120
definitely frustrate the criminals maybe

673
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,640
not frustrate the right team

674
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,080
but you'll see what i mean we want we

675
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,760
want to get them to

676
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,520
drop off and and quit

677
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,600
behind the scenes from a behavior

678
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,360
economics perspective we're looking at

679
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,960
the behavior we want to get

680
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,240
we're looking at the barriers that get

681
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
in the way of that behavior and the

682
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,559
benefits and we want to clarify those

683
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,480
behaviors we want to reduce barriers for

684
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,679
our uh

685
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,280
users we want to amplify the benefits

686
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,640
otherwise of course they just don't do

687
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,320
what we want to do think about every

688
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,679
time you've had multifaction they've

689
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,039
ignored it ignored it think about every

690
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,640
time you got a password policy

691
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,080
and they just kept changing the year

692
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,760
think about every time you've said

693
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,919
don't click on links and they just keep

694
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,120
clicking on links

695
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,799
right it's just the way it works

696
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,720
so by figuring out the behaviors we need

697
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,159
and what those barriers are

698
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,840
with the security champion and advocate

699
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
working together we can put in place a

700
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,039
process

701
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,960
and of course it won't always work

702
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,559
there's a lot of different ways that can

703
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,120
it can

704
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,799
fail there's a great paper on this

705
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,400
learning from behavior challenges that

706
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
fail if you want to read more

707
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
we can start categorizing and figuring

708
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,919
out why things aren't

709
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,400
going the right way and there's a number

710
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,679
of reasons for that it could be they

711
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,400
don't know

712
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,159
again i think awareness is the first

713
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,720
step it's not action but to start

714
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,559
it could be designed just frustrating or

715
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
the culture is against them

716
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,559
i've been in cases where organizations

717
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,919
were going through a merger

718
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,000
and trying to to deal with insider

719
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,279
threat scenarios and that

720
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,120
poof now could be investments maybe more

721
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,960
people or more time it could just be

722
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,200
incentives devops needs to put out code

723
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
and security teams slowing them down

724
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,640
we can start looking at those four to

725
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,720
troubleshoot the taxonomy of why of

726
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,559
behavior change and figure out what

727
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,840
and why it went wrong

728
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
and from there we can work with security

729
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,320
and introduce steps introduce the bricks

730
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,559
worst case something that stops the user

731
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,400
a little bit better if it slows the user

732
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,080
my favorite of course is invisible or

733
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,159
even speeds up the user

734
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,799
i had an entire exploration series

735
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,400
called securing without slowing

736
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,120
we found a number of interesting cases

737
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,960
where security actually made the users

738
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,159
go faster

739
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,279
by removing things by simplifying things

740
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,720
plenty of ways to do it the reason for

741
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,559
this of course is from from a blue team

742
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,000
perspective that the more creative our

743
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
users are

744
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,799
the more likely they are to work around

745
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,960
us and open up holes

746
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,799
and from a blue team perspective the

747
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,559
reason for this is the better we can

748
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,440
understand

749
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,480
the human side of the red teamer or the

750
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
adversary the better we can put in place

751
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,600
steps

752
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,919
that go ahead and intersect with what

753
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,880
they're going to do

754
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,679
and add those steps verizon data breach

755
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,039
report actually has a

756
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,480
great set of data on this that shows

757
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,960
that if you get the steps

758
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,559
to around 10 or more that the

759
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,559
success of the attack actually drops in

760
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,000
half

761
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,880
so we know adding steps can really be

762
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,880
impactful

763
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,120
from the blue team perspective we're

764
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,960
thinking about ways that

765
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,640
we can enable access and harden things

766
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,840
applying use cases approaches and

767
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
running those use cases down to our sock

768
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,200
so we can have better product security

769
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
better intel better i t security having

770
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,520
basically a common set

771
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,279
of blue team use cases that we're

772
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,440
enabling and talking about in a common

773
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,679
way

774
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,159
from a red team perspective we obviously

775
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:04,720
want to

776
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
communicate those to the red team have

777
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
them be tested

778
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,320
have it be proven make sure it actually

779
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,039
works

780
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,360
all the things cedric's gonna talk about

781
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,320
because

782
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,720
the greatest security is is meaningless

783
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,799
if it's just a false sense of security

784
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,279
uh i had a a kind i was working with i

785
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:21,919
was

786
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,200
really impressed with the security

787
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
appliances working great they said

788
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,760
very few false positives they said we

789
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
almost never have to worry about it they

790
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,159
said

791
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,200
uh and as we got closer and closer and

792
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,960
actually tested it it turned out the

793
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,840
reason

794
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,559
it had so few false positives was that

795
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:38,880
the

796
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,799
intrusion system was actually unplugged

797
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,320
it was still in the management network

798
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,559
but it wasn't monitoring a damn thing

799
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,679
so as you might imagine that that was

800
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,120
not an effective control

801
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,039
and not something that would have been

802
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,400
necessarily caught

803
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,559
without someone doing some adversarial

804
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,200
emulation

805
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,760
so as as we're thinking about ways to

806
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,559
to get engaged with this i am working uh

807
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,400
with a couple mentees doing some

808
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,279
coaching

809
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,559
on taking this approach to the

810
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,400
environment what works what doesn't

811
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,679
if you're interested in that feel free

812
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,520
to reach out

813
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,039
all right in our last couple of minutes

814
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,960
together number four

815
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,240
the conclusion bringing this all

816
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,039
together obviously every time someone

817
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,399
picks up a mouse

818
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,559
they're making a choice to strengthen or

819
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,520
lessen our security

820
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,440
we hope they choose wisely we hope to be

821
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,399
protecting the user and fighting for the

822
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,679
user

823
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,200
it's very difficult to get done

824
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,360
if we don't have visibility into the

825
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
friction points what's working

826
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,640
what's not it's very difficult to be

827
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,360
done

828
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,840
if we don't have the empathy right and

829
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,279
in those scenarios that's where you end

830
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:53,919
up with

831
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,760
a six-month miles that costs several

832
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,640
thousands of dollars

833
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,399
but this approach is still early this

834
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,320
approach is still something that

835
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,760
i'm playing with and trying to figure

836
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,520
out the best way

837
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,320
to to describe it to build a process

838
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
around it

839
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,080
and uh you know i think back to the

840
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,760
early days of threat modeling same thing

841
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,240
we were

842
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,679
finding our way in the dark until it

843
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,240
made sense i think about early you know

844
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
ttps same thing finding our way in the

845
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,600
dark until we had

846
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,080
the mitre attack framework but sometimes

847
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,440
you just need to start

848
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,200
and go from there there's a great story

849
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,480
another legend in ideal again ideo being

850
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
the company behind the mouse

851
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
many other design decisions and design

852
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,440
thinking

853
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
and uh in the 1970s there's this uh

854
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,640
gentleman

855
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,799
uh mogridge was his name he was you know

856
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,720
going back and forth meetings going back

857
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,760
and forth up and down

858
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,000
across silicon valley it was beat up old

859
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,039
briefcase

860
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,240
and it was heavy you could tell it's

861
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,559
heavy and in between meetings he would

862
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,000
open it up and rearrange the parts

863
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
inside

864
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,399
and uh and what he was doing was trying

865
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,679
to figure out

866
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,559
how to make a computer portable so he

867
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,399
had put all the key components in

868
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,240
in this briefcase and was working

869
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,679
through the idea

870
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,240
and uh eventually 1982 the grid compass

871
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,080
came out 1982 the great compass was

872
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,640
released as the first portable device

873
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,600
based on his designs and it's a legacy

874
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,039
to this day as i'm presenting to you

875
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,640
right now that all our computers open

876
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,000
like this briefcase

877
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,799
right why because in early days that was

878
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,200
the

879
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,520
inside off we just put the screen here

880
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,039
the keyboard there the pots there

881
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,399
it'll work so i've got a lot of faith in

882
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,679
prototyping

883
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,320
and figuring these things out so please

884
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
do feel free to reach out to me as we go

885
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,799
through this process

886
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,760
but uh you know it is imperative that we

887
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,080
think about it from an adversarial lens

888
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,320
uh here's here's one tip if you get

889
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,520
nothing else

890
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,960
out of this talk remember this if you

891
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,799
want to win uh

892
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,520
rock paper scissors here's how you do it

893
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,320
there's uh some

894
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,200
threat and tell we have uh if you win

895
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,799
winners tend to repeat the session so

896
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,840
they go rock rock

897
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,039
and they won with that they're gonna do

898
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,039
rock next time almost always

899
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,120
if they lose they rotate rock paper

900
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,360
scissors so if you lost with a rock

901
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,799
most likely your adversary is going to

902
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,279
go with uh paper necks rock paper

903
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,399
scissors

904
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,640
so you can win by having that intel

905
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,039
right and it seems like that's exactly

906
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,200
the thing that you need to do

907
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,480
until you talk to the red team they're

908
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,559
like yeah so what's cool is

909
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,960
did you know if you spun paper fast

910
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,279
enough

911
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,919
you could actually cut the scissors and

912
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,039
it completely turns things on its head

913
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,360
right this idea that we had great intel

914
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,279
we knew exactly what to do goes out the

915
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,880
window the minute you get some creative

916
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,080
red teamers and they're doing some

917
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,679
creative things

918
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,080
so please do stay tuned for cedric's

919
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,880
talk coming up next on building

920
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
a effective red team where he's going to

921
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
talk about the complement to this

922
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,320
which is how you build a team that can

923
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080
test hammer away at things

924
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,440
and help find areas that we've

925
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
overlooked and find areas where we can

926
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,000
add controls without adding friction

927
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,679
or overhead to our end users

928
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,760
with that i'll take any questions i know

929
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,279
i'm at the bottom of the hour we got

930
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,799
just a few minutes so

931
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,559
if anyone has anything they want to pop

932
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,399
in chat or questions feel free

933
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,480
and otherwise thanks so much for joining

934
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,919
i hope you guys are having a great grim

935
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,159
con

936
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,760
thank you so much that was great

937
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,080
no idea we were going to learn so much

938
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,490
about mice

939
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,120
[Laughter]

940
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,240
what about cicadas dave i have a whole

941
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,960
talk on cicadas coming up

942
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,240
really we can go back to mice i i prefer

943
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,919
this topic actually

944
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,039
i want to hear about the cycadis

945
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,799
do you though do we want to hear about

946
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,640
this we'll hear a lot from the cicadas

947
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,440
in may

948
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,440
right so we don't need any anymore

949
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,600
true story why borrow trouble early

950
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,760
absolutely

951
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,519
so something i was not expecting in the

952
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,880
talk and of course it makes sense when

953
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,000
you're really thinking about

954
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,360
design is that empathy is understanding

955
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
somebody else's experience

956
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,080
and that can tie into anything from the

957
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,519
emotional components which were part of

958
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,080
our

959
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,159
keynote all the way to professional

960
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,679
components right like

961
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,679
what do users experience and why and i

962
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,279
think that's something that

963
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,080
is a particular challenge to security

964
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,279
because inherently

965
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,080
we're a blocking function both

966
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,679
technically and process wise

967
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,360
yeah there's a couple of things there

968
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,240
right one is how do you develop empathy

969
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,960
uh my my wife does uh consulting and she

970
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,640
used to teach doctors and she would tell

971
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,279
them

972
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,039
yeah no you don't need to be empathetic

973
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,159
i get it you know she'd be talking to

974
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:52,880
someone like dr

975
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,120
cox off of scrubs character like just

976
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,640
you just need to do these three things

977
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,480
to pretend

978
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
to build the connection i hope we don't

979
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,240
have to get to that but i do realize

980
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,559
that

981
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,519
empathy in itself can be hard the second

982
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,720
thing is empathy at

983
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,600
scale is pretty much impossible which is

984
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,919
why i think we really need advocates

985
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,320
and champions it's really easy for us to

986
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
go oh i helped this one person at work

987
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,120
that i liked

988
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,880
it's very hard to think about oh this

989
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,799
business unit of a thousand people

990
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,120
across the pond needs these four things

991
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,000
what do i need to do

992
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
to help them we really need to bring the

993
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,080
voice of the person who's experiencing

994
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,760
it and listen to them to come up with

995
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,799
security

996
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,440
uh that is effective but not weighing

997
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,320
them down or getting in the way

998
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,679
did medieval castles really take 40

999
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,320
percent

1000
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,840
of the property of the like local areas

1001
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,279
revenue i don't even know how you would

1002
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,120
measure the revenue

1003
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,840
it's the feudal system yes absolutely

1004
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,519
it's a feudal system

1005
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,320
um and now we can argue as you know our

1006
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,080
country's spending that percentage of

1007
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,720
revenue

1008
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,039
today there can be some arguments and

1009
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,320
some correlations there but there's a

1010
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,519
reason why

1011
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,440
no one builds castles anymore there's a

1012
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,200
reason why they went out of fashion is

1013
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,720
because they're very expensive took way

1014
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,760
too long

1015
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,960
and were not responsive to uh to threats

1016
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,079
i thought the reason i think you're just

1017
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,320
pure gunpowder yeah

1018
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,040
exactly put some gunpowder on and some

1019
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,239
some cavalry

1020
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,399
and um all of a sudden you don't have

1021
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,719
something that can be responsive

1022
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,158
maybe that is the future interestingly

1023
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,560
on on the subject of castles and

1024
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,520
evolving

1025
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,960
uh defenses in nuremberg the the castle

1026
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,320
there has a

1027
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,760
has a wall around it that comes off at

1028
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,800
odd angles

1029
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,719
just the constantly changing angles

1030
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,560
around it because uh

1031
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,440
that actually made it harder to scale up

1032
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,960
the wall than rather than having one

1033
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,159
flat flat

1034
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,399
wall there's there's a lot of there

1035
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,079
there's a lot of room for metaphor there

1036
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,119
to our

1037
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,159
to our current location absolutely the

1038
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,079
the making it hard to scale

1039
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,960
the the um the windows two that were

1040
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
very hard to shoot arrows in

1041
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,680
but allowed for a lot of view out you

1042
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,160
know

1043
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
great metaphor there in terms of doing

1044
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,720
orchestration and telemetry on

1045
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,279
end points

1046
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,280
cool well i thought it was a really good

1047
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,040
presentation

1048
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,240
i i really enjoyed the uh

1049
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,320
the cleanliness of your presentation i

1050
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
guess in a way i thought it was like

1051
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,359
you know like it some of these ideas are

1052
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,800
pretty complex

1053
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,480
at some level and you presented them

1054
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,960
really well um

1055
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,680
and if people have further questions for

1056
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,160
you

1057
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,720
i assume they annoy you in the discord

1058
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,240
is that correct

1059
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,880
yeah i me in the discord or reach out to

1060
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,400
my website

1061
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,280
