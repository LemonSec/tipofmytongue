1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,440
good morning

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,560
grimcon04 i can't believe this is the

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,000
fourth one that we've been doing we

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,040
started this

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,240
uh a year ago when everything went crazy

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,160
and we just wanted to find a way to get

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,160
back and continue to share content and

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,520
the part that i think that really makes

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,640
this special

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,880
is the new speaker track where we're out

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,480
there trying to bring

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,480
new voices to the table because i think

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,400
it's that diversity of opinion

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,840
that is the cornerstone of good cyber

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,480
security um

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,079
and for those of you don't know how we

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,079
do it is we actually pair them up a

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,079
month in advance with a coach

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,600
so thank you to all of the volunteers

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,440
and the coaches that help make this

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,480
possible

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,600
um and they help them with everything

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
they need to make sure that they bring

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,079

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,000

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,080
grant

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,440
to assist cyber security nonprofits uh

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
from a foundation that my wife cindy

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
gula and i uh created we basically put

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,200
up a million dollars

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
to have people from all across the

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
united states basically

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,400
submit applications and ideas for how

78
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,319
better to increase african american

79
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,800
engagement in cyber security

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
everybody knows most people out there

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
kind of look like me and bryson you know

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,480
old white old white dudes

83
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
and we need a lot of diversity and not

84
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
just diversity and skin color but

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,440
diversity of ideas

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,319
we want to be very very specific and

87
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,360
very purposeful

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,560
about focusing on african americans we

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
had almost 100 different great

90
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
organizations apply

91
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
we announced our 11 finalists so you can

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,120
go to google.tech

93
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,640
google.techh and see who they were but

94
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
we announced three winners

95
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,519
uh the third winner was girl security a

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,400
lot of you know

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
uh camille stewart from share the mic

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,599
she's on the board of

99
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,280
girls security they focus on

100
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,440
african-american young women

101
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,879
and they not only teach them cyber

102
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
security but they also teach a national

103
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,319
security policy which i think is a

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,440
really good

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,519
way to kind of enhance not just teach

106
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,959
people python

107
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
we also had a second place winner of

108
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,159
npower

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,959
npower really focuses on you know

110
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,959
stereotypically low income inner city

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,440
type

112
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,640
of of of black and and local

113
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,720
economic uh uh different types of

114
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
demographics

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
who don't have the opportunity to go to

116
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,439
like a two-year trade school two-year

117
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,560
certification

118
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
so they uh they really focus on getting

119
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,680
them trained in i.t

120
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,319
and in cyber security and then our first

121
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
place winner which got a half a million

122
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,799
dollar

123
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,519
grant was the black cyber security

124
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,799
association

125
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,439
and this was a very very emotional very

126
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,519
very very powerful type of of

127
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
application really stood out from

128
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,199
all the other great applicants that we

129
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,440
had but they really focused on the

130
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,360
pipeline of talent they do everything

131
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,080
from

132
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
helping kids in high school and younger

133
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
you know learn about capture the flag

134
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,479
how to do cyber security

135
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,160
and all the way up to mentorship because

136
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,680
once you learn of course you you know

137
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,040
you can't just like walk in and get a

138
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,479
job you really have to understand the

139
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,240
lay of the land and whatnot so we're

140
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,479
very excited most of these people are

141
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,840
going to be coming on

142
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,759
uh my wife and i's show the ghoulitech

143
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,120
cyber fiction show

144
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
and uh so we'll be doing more from that

145
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
we also announced

146
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,600
the next foundation grant and we are

147
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
going to be focusing

148
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,960
on expanding cyber security to the

149
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,919
non-cyber people out there so we're

150
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,520
going to be announcing a grant

151
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,720
march 22nd any type of cyber security

152
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,440
nonprofit

153
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,039
that's increasing cyber security

154
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,680
awareness to people not on this call

155
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
you know can apply it could be

156
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,639
everything from creating materials for

157
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,160
k-12 education

158
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,080
it could be teaching senior citizens how

159
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,320
to avoid phone scams or or email

160
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,039
phishing

161
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,280
anything we can do to raise awareness

162
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
outside of cyber security

163
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,960
everybody here is in the bubble people

164
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,199
outside the bubble they had no idea

165
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,360
who what cisa is they have no idea what

166
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
iot why

167
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
why why should they care about the

168
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,520
refrigerator we need to increase more of

169
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,240
that stuff

170
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,000
so if you work with any nonprofits and

171
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,280
some of you guys are on
