25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,800
disclaimer um the following talk

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,879
contains personal thoughts ideas

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,719
pigeons they do not represent those of

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,079
my current or past

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,559
employers any cyber security events

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,559
characters and or companies depicted in

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,240
the course of this presentation are

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
purely fictitious any similarities to

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,920
actual events characters and or

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,400
companies

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
are also purely coincidental okay now

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
that we got that out of the way who

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,320
am i well hi i'm emmanuel triboya i've

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,840
been working in security for about seven

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,200
years now

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
i'm sand certified so you can trust me

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,479
and i sit on the silicon valley issa

42
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,360
board

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,000
of directors right so um i got my

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
started in site reliability engineering

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,000
back at nasa so i worked in super

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,079
computing they called it the control

47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,880
room

48
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
so i was a control room analyst but

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,479
basically my job was to monitor

50
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,799
and maintain the availability of that

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,000
supercomputer

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,759
eventually i transitioned into security

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,439
and i sat in the security operations

54
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,680
center at nasa where i started off as a

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
triage analyst like many people do

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
grinding away looking at those phishing

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,439
emails and alerts and then i moved up to

58
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,920
triage lead so that i could help train

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,119
on board and you know

60
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479
get our new staff member operationalized

61
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,520
that was a great time when i left nasa i

62
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,479
left as a

63
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,959
senior security analyst where basically

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,319
i had a responsibility

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,480
um you know integrating and working with

66
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
the cyber threat intelligence team the

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,599
forensics team

68
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
all those incident responders at every

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,959
one of our centers

70
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,319
and it was a great time great

71
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,800
opportunity to learn um but eventually i

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,239
needed to make my way into the private

73
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:26,720
sector

74
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,120
and that's where i've been in product

75
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
security product security is a great

76
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,120
place for security members so if you

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,360
haven't really heard of product security

78
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,879
uh let me tell you it's a wonderful

79
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,120
place where you get to focus on

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
the products and the infrastructure and

81
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,280
you get to look at many different facets

82
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,319
of security

83
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,160
so i have had the pleasure of working in

84
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,000
vulnerability management

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
threat modeling devsecops architectural

86
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
design review you name it

87
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
product security allows me to have

88
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
multiple different paths

89
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
um and so i really love it i also still

90
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,840
do a lot of incident response and

91
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,200
security operations

92
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
um so i'm glad i have the experience to

93
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,319
kind of leverage

94
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,599
all right now that you know a little bit

95
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,920
about me let's get into the talk

96
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,120
so um oh yeah follow me on

97
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,720
twitter and hit me on linkedin if you

98
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,159
like great

99
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,080
so why are we talking about this well

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,159
apt attack emulation is a

101
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,159
somewhat advanced topic this kind of

102
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,200
goes

103
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,959
into some of the concepts which have

104
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,319
been presented or

105
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,319
discussed in white papers and or

106
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,680
prominent articles

107
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
right so you know mitre itself does

108
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,480
evaluation on tools for apt detection

109
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,239
and alliance to miter

110
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,720
additionally there are lots of articles

111
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,239
on you know strengthening your cyber

112
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,480
resilience with the apt attack emulation

113
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,760
and that's why we want to focus on this

114
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
today we want to strengthen our

115
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,720
resilience

116
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,959
again there's also um you know great

117
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,400
opportunities to just learn

118
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
learn more about your industry learn

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
more about the advanced actors that

120
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,319
exist within it

121
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,519
and what kind of techniques they're

122
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,920
employing to focus in on you

123
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
and get that critical data and or

124
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,959
infrastructure

125
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
okay cool well so background on miter

126
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,280
attack i'm hoping

127
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
most of you are familiar with this but

128
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,959
let's do a quick breakdown minor attack

129
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,319
well it's based on the lockheed martin

130
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
cyber kill chain that's about 10 years

131
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
old now so it's been around a while

132
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
there's 12 enterprise tactics there are

133
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
178 techniques

134
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,720
and 352 sub techniques so it's always

135
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,279
growing

136
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,918
it's uh i mean this is going to be a

137
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,479
part of

138
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
security for for years and years to come

139
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,919
so if you're not familiar

140
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,320
do yourself a favor familiarize yourself

141
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,680
if you are familiar

142
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
uh apologies for the obligatory

143
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
breakdown

144
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,759
all right so again what is uh what is

145
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,639
attack um

146
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,040
well it's focusing on ttps and that's

147
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,680
where we

148
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
are gonna go in and do a deep dive what

149
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
is a ttp

150
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
well i could read to you what's on the

151
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,120
slide but uh you know check out this

152
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
joint publication

153
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,000
we basically as a cyber security

154
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
community um

155
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
abstracted out the description here

156
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,440
which is more

157
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,639
military or warfare based and

158
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,880
use it in a way to track our advanced

159
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,000
cert actors

160
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,759
uh their tactics techniques and

161
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
procedures

162
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,600
um okay cool so background on mitre

163
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,199
attack on the left side of my screen

164
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,320
you're going to see the

165
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
pyramid of pain on the right side you're

166
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
going to see the normal breakdown of the

167
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,320
locking martin cyberkill chain and how

168
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,840
that kind of

169
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
breaks down into the pre-attack and

170
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,759
attack for enterprise so

171
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,120
uh if you worked in the sock soccer

172
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,800
you've worked in security

173
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,280
you're probably aware of iocs uh you're

174
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,520
probably also aware that uh they're

175
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
they're usually old by the time you get

176
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,600
them you know 24 hours is a long time in

177
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
the ioc world right so

178
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
we don't want to focus on that um those

179
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,960
are great automate it get it in

180
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,840
put the blocks in that's boring stuff we

181
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,320
want to focus on ttps ttps

182
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
are very so pyramid of pain it's very

183
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,520
tough

184
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
for those advanced actors to change it

185
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,680
it's kind of like a footprint

186
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
or a calling card if you will and it

187
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,759
allows us investigators and analysts to

188
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,360
go in and say hey looks like

189
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
you know these uh you know these

190
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,479
footprints behind

191
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,880
this crime scene are potentially

192
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,840
attributed to

193
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
these known advanced road actors because

194
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
we've observed it in you know previous

195
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,280
engagements that they've been in

196
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,919
um okay and on the right hand side of my

197
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
screen again back to the lockheed martin

198
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,319
cyber kill chain

199
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,479
attack for enterprise has those 12

200
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,000
tactics and it's listed right there from

201
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
initial access all the way to impact

202
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
that's what we're focusing on

203
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,720
there are some values to pre-attack but

204
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,639
that's not the focus of this talk today

205
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,039
all right cool so let's talk about

206
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,400
verticals

207
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,520
also just industries these are the high

208
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,919
level buckets that you probably exist in

209
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,440
today

210
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
energy education healthcare finance

211
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
right which one do you exist in

212
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,759
well my time at nasa was probably

213
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,199
aerospace and see how this were

214
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,080
very easy is aerospace right my time in

215
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,000
the private sector encompassed high tech

216
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
and also healthcare so

217
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,199
identify which vertical you exist in

218
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,199
that's going to help you easily identify

219
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,759
apts that exist and are targeting your

220
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,560
organization

221
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,840
okay so now you know what your vertical

222
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,240
is

223
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,160
now you know well hey there's apts that

224
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,599
are going to be targeting just us

225
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,319
just us in healthcare or just us in you

226
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,000
know energy sector well where do i get

227
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
that data well that's kind of a hard

228
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,759
question because threat intelligence

229
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,400
is global right it's not just from one

230
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,520
source of truth

231
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
so there is some bias which country

232
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,800
which company

233
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
what timeline was that threat data

234
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
extracted

235
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
but there are some very good resources

236
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,560
which i highly recommend

237
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,400
one of them is going to be fireeye great

238
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
reporting uh great analysis

239
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,759
great ttps um uh you know the

240
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,680
the folks at fireeye do an incredible

241
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
job uh same with crowdstrike

242
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,319
great reporting it allows us analysts

243
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,599
and engineers to go ahead and take

244
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,400
action

245
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,479
um and kind of scale their their work

246
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,440
right

247
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
miter attack by itself is also

248
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,280
extracting those uh cyber threat

249
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,879
intelligence data sets and then they're

250
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,639
putting it into their their framework so

251
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,319
that's one single point of truth if you

252
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,319
want to say that there is one um

253
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,680
all right cool so this talk is again

254
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,160
about

255
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
apt attack emulation uh the common

256
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
terminology i think industry-wide is

257
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,400
breach and attack simulation

258
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
um but i think it's synonymous so

259
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,160
whichever you're familiar with is fine i

260
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,120
don't think there's really a

261
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
specifically right

262
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520
version of it so let's go into the

263
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,440
background really quick here

264
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,240
right before we were into apt advanced

265
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
uh you know

266
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,080
attack emulation blue teams red teams

267
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
existed and the blue teams defend

268
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,639
the red teams attack you look for gaps

269
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,479
you have reports this goes on quarterly

270
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,759
maybe annually

271
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,559
and then you try to mitigate those gaps

272
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,279
well

273
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,760
how is that aligned to actors that exist

274
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,559
and the

275
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,159
you know how do you know that you're

276
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,760
going to be able to detect defend

277
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,640
against them it doesn't always usually

278
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
it's just going to be

279
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,800
um you know hey you have visibility or

280
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
coverage gaps

281
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,600
and you need to to work to get that

282
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
telemetry you need

283
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,640
to work to get logs off of these

284
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,200
endpoints or you need to to get a better

285
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,959
security posture in general right so red

286
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,600
team's

287
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,800
a great place to start as you start kind

288
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,360
of like

289
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,560
uh kind of fine-tuning and strengthening

290
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,000
your security posture

291
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
you might think you're done you know uh

292
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
you might get a report from a red team

293
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,959
and they might not find anything

294
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,720
well that's time for you to start doing

295
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
some more advanced uh emulations right

296
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,040
so

297
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
purple teaming is kind of where the red

298
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
team and the blue team work

299
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,720
collaboratively with a shared goal and

300
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,040
you're saying look we want to identify

301
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,959
apts in our environments and

302
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,720
or in our threat vertical rather and we

303
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
want to know what those ttps are we want

304
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,200
to emulate them

305
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
we want to see what we can detect what

306
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
our gaps are we want to close those gaps

307
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,120
so that's where breach and attack

308
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
simulation kind of exists it's in that

309
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
purple team function okay it's

310
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,880
collaborative

311
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,640
it requires multiple skill sets and

312
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,040
multiple practitioners to engage it

313
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,839
all right cool so hey before we get

314
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,399
started

315
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,680
i'm just going to go ahead and toss this

316
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,440
out as a warning do not

317
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
do breach and attack simulation on your

318
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,040
environment without getting

319
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,000
stakeholder buy-in get your lead get

320
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
your director

321
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,519
get them to thumbs up this breach and

322
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,600
attack simulation on a specific

323
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,399
environment for specific uh you know

324
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,600
atomic test or unit test rather

325
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
otherwise you might find yourself in an

326
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
incident report not gonna look good so

327
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
i'm not gonna take that that flak if you

328
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,399
get in trouble

329
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,959
please uh make sure your stakeholders

330
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,519
are

331
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,600
in the loop and they've all thumbs up

332
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,959
this uh this product okay

333
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,160
or a project rather great so how do you

334
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
do that well get your scope get your

335
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,519
success criteria your objectives present

336
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,800
it to them let them know why you're

337
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
doing this and let them know you know

338
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
hey this is uh so we can advance

339
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
our our you know capacity to understand

340
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
where our gaps are so i can help the

341
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,720
executive leadership identify where to

342
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
prioritize resources

343
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
it's important for everybody all right

344
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
so primarily if you're going to be doing

345
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
this you're going to be doing it in

346
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,440
either developments or production

347
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,200
um i think that there are some benefits

348
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,959
to doing it in production but the the

349
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,720
downside is pretty major so

350
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
here's my suggestion focus on the

351
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,519
development side you're going to be able

352
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,240
to build

353
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,920
infrastructure in developments that's

354
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,839
reflective of production

355
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
but if and when you do something where

356
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
you bring it down the application gets

357
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,120
broken or the server

358
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,079
you know just gets toast well you didn't

359
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,760
you know fault something in production

360
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
there's no down time for production and

361
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,680
uh you know servers uh that matter don't

362
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,640
get hurt right so

363
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,160
in development you can go ahead and

364
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,480
emulate your production environment

365
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,560
um and then go ahead and deploy your

366
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
breach and attack simulation tool

367
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
uh get your automated you know atomic

368
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
test or unit tests in

369
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,040
and then uh extract all those findings

370
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,519
uh map it to attack so

371
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,320
yeah i recommend dev it's safer and if

372
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,640
you

373
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,079
do something then you can always just

374
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,200
wipe a reload so do something about that

375
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,640
all right so very quickly high level

376
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,480
different subsets of attack emulation

377
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
encompass essentially malware detonation

378
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
behavioral emulation and

379
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,839
behavioral replay i just want to focus

380
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,040
today's talk on

381
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
behavioral emulation okay the others

382
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
have uh prominent places

383
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,279
um but that's out of scope for this talk

384
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,560
if you want to learn more just go ahead

385
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:02,959
and

386
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,240
you know get in your your favorite

387
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
search browser and just uh you know

388
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,040
search it on there so all right so again

389
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,639
high level right when you're talking

390
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,519
about any tools

391
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,279
vendor related or open source they're

392
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,639
generally going to be categorized under

393
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
black box all the way to white box black

394
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
box says hey it's a proprietary

395
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
technology you can't see it it just

396
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,560
works press this button

397
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,240
that works for some organizations when

398
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
you need to scale it and you need to

399
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
to know it works and you have a you know

400
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
somebody on standby

401
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
with an sla for for you to call when it

402
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,720
doesn't

403
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
that's what that's for okay it also

404
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,680
comes with a heavier cost which means

405
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
you need to do a poc

406
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,639
you're going to need to have success

407
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,079
criteria and you're going to need to

408
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,519
make sure that this tool actually works

409
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,040
for the use cases that you've already

410
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,600
defined

411
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,880
right so that's this talk is going to

412
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
help you understand what those use cases

413
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
are how to define it and how to go

414
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
forward with that

415
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
that white box version is what i would

416
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,519
consider to be open source tools so you

417
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,800
know what the code is you can see it

418
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,079
yourself you can edit it

419
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,920
and you can do exactly which unit test

420
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
you want to do that's my preference the

421
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,320
drawback

422
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,079
is you got to have somebody that knows

423
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,440
what they're doing

424
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
so there is a slight technical barrier

425
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
to entry but again if you're doing it in

426
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,519
development

427
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,600
um there's a little bit of room for you

428
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,360
to to kind of learn on the fly

429
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,920
um but you know that's the thing is it's

430
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,200
your organization

431
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,839
uh it's your project you define what you

432
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,240
want

433
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,200
and uh go forward from there okay cool

434
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,680
so

435
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,959
let's talk about some frameworks let's

436
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,040
talk about some tools all right so again

437
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,959
this talk is mostly focusing on minor

438
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,560
attack if you find yourself with a

439
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,839
breach and attack or

440
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,880
emulation tool that doesn't somehow find

441
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,360
itself

442
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,120
aligned to minor attack that's okay

443
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
because miter makes attack navigator it

444
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,720
allows you to manually map things

445
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,360
um and you know hey but just just go

446
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,800
with a tool that that maps to miter

447
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,279
attack

448
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,959
if you find one that doesn't i'd like to

449
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,800
know so you know ping me on twitter

450
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,279
um and then tools okay so i think

451
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:49,839
there's

452
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,480
a lot more out there uh but for the the

453
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,880
you know

454
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
the time for this talk i can't go into

455
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,720
everything so we're just gonna focus on

456
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
some of the higher or more prominent

457
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,320
tools in the industry right so the two

458
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,279
open source

459
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,360
tools that i really like are going to be

460
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
red canary's atomic red team

461
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,160
and caldara from mitre commercial tools

462
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
are pretty verbose there are some pretty

463
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,680
good ones out there i won't really go

464
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,800
into that but

465
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,440
you know hey again if you want to go

466
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,160
look at

467
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,519
you know the magic quadrant and find out

468
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,199
which one fits your your profile and

469
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,279
budget then go ahead and do that um

470
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,800
start with open source give it a test

471
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,639
see if you can find any you know useful

472
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,240
return on investment and then go ask for

473
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,120
the budget for it

474
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,120
um all right cool so use cases again

475
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,199
like i was telling you well to to do

476
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
this you have to structure it some way

477
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
and to structure it you have to know a

478
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,760
little bit of that background that i

479
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,120
gave you earlier which is hey what's our

480
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,680
vertical

481
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,199
what are the apts how do we get

482
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,040
information on those epts

483
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
well now that we have this information

484
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,480
so what what do we do okay well

485
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,920
we're going to be focusing on the apt

486
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,279
use cases for breach and attack

487
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
simulation but there are some really

488
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,199
cool ones out there let's say that

489
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,920
you need a new endpoint uh you know

490
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,760
detection response tool or you need a

491
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,639
new

492
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,560
next-gen av or you know firewall

493
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
well maybe you want to do some breach

494
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,920
and attack simulations

495
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,079
on that new product to see hey does the

496
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,560
vendor actually do what we wanted to do

497
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,639
or are there some gaps where you know

498
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,920
this doesn't actually fill what we

499
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,279
needed to fill that's some cool use

500
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,440
cases for breach and attack simulation

501
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,120
i would say that that's outside the

502
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,720
scope of this talk okay

503
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,839
we're just going to focus on those

504
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,680
apt-based ones but there's some some

505
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,639
very cool

506
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,880
scenarios that you can run through so

507
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,079
once you adopt this

508
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,000
once you get familiarized with it you

509
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
can go ahead and you know run wild with

510
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,079
all the different use cases

511
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,079
okay so now that we know hey this talk

512
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,839
is again just focused on apts

513
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,160
and how to emulate them well how do you

514
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,959
do that well

515
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,920
let's go ahead and go through an

516
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,079
emulation plan you're gonna need this

517
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,759
and i can tell you each one of these

518
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,680
little boxes it's not as easy as it

519
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,240
looks

520
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,399
you're gonna have to spend some time i'd

521
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,000
say this is probably a good

522
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,199
30-day project to fully familiarize

523
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,720
yourself but it could be as

524
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,800
you know easy as 30 minutes or one hour

525
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,079
depending right so

526
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,079
hey threat intelligence acquisition

527
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,759
right what's your vertical who are the

528
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,519
apts extract that

529
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,680
meaningful information from the industry

530
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,880
that's in threat intelligence

531
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,519
acquisition

532
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,560
next extract actionable techniques okay

533
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,880
so you got your your threat actors you

534
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,399
know what the ttps are

535
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,040
which ones matter to you do you want to

536
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,639
look at all the apts that exist and

537
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,399
focus on those crossovers

538
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,000
that's what extracting actionable

539
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,519
techniques are okay

540
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,279
then you're going to say which tool

541
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,680
works for our specific use cases here

542
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,920
sometimes it doesn't align to atomic red

543
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,360
team sometimes it does

544
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,199
that's based on what your use cases are

545
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,120
and what your requirements are

546
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,079
okay now that you have that set up your

547
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,040
infrastructure

548
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,440
developments again is probably the best

549
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,120
way to go about doing this

550
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,399
or deploy to production if you're

551
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,800
feeling risky okay you usually don't

552
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,160
want to pull into production but

553
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,560
again if you do get your stakeholders to

554
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,279
buy in

555
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,959
thumbs up and make sure that they know

556
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,639
when and and what

557
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,560
what may happen if you do that okay

558
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
great so then

559
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,480
go forward do your attack emulation

560
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,559
emulate your specific adversaries

561
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,959
um and then collect that data map it

562
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,599
back to

563
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,000
uh to you know minor attack and see what

564
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,359
your gaps are okay

565
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,079
that's the whole plan here is understand

566
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,559
the advanced threat actors those ttps

567
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,280
and then emulate them with these tools

568
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,559
and then find those gaps

569
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,839
very important and it's going to help

570
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,919
you highlight and prioritize budget

571
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,559
and resources okay a couple of things

572
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,839
here you don't have to use

573
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,640
my emulation plan because well it's very

574
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,200
high level

575
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,799
it doesn't actually have anything so you

576
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,559
can go out and use the center for

577
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,320
threatened form defense's emulation

578
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,280
library

579
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,200
and they have three emulation plans

580
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
there where you can just quickly deploy

581
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,000
it so

582
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,600
if you don't want to learn all this

583
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
stuff and you want to just quickly test

584
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,640
something see if there's any value for

585
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,200
you

586
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,760
well cool we can do that so the center

587
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,520
for threat informed defense has

588
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,600
three emulation plans right now fin6

589
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
apt-29 and menu pass

590
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,039
there's a quick summary this is showing

591
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,320
you the markdown language this is on

592
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,280
their github page

593
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
i'll link to that at the end of this

594
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,799
talk um at the top center of this

595
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,400
slide you're going to see basically what

596
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,799
is yaml so that's the machine readable

597
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,280
language and you can edit it as well

598
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,480
and that's going to go through the unit

599
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,160
test so you see scenario one this is

600
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,840
based on attack id

601
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,960
you know t1105 ingress tool transfer and

602
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,880
it's showing you what the cti source was

603
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
right like i said hey

604
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
fire eye crowd strike great sources but

605
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,320
also recorded future so you can see

606
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,919
there's multiple sources to extract that

607
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,280
information

608
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,960
and align it so that you can say well we

609
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,280
know that this ttp

610
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,440
uh is aligned to this threat actor

611
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,799
because of this report

612
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,400
we're going to then emulate it and to

613
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
see what our detection

614
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
is for this okay so that's kind of

615
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
behind the scenes

616
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,919
this is this is one of those things

617
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,320
where you know if you don't know yaml

618
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,520
it's pretty easy it's uh as you can see

619
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,360
it's kind of human readable so

620
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,640
familiarize yourself uh don't be afraid

621
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,520
okay so just to kind of uh cover a

622
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,799
couple topics here right

623
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
define your threat model how do you do

624
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,000
that well we kind of went over some of

625
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,440
it but that's an in-depth topic by

626
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,000
itself

627
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,320
who's your threat actor in your vertical

628
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,080
what are those ttps

629
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,440
extracted from that cyber threat

630
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,320
intelligence and then put it into action

631
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
um one thing i do want to note here is

632
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
that there's a great talk by

633
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,840
uh ruben uh boomin and marcus baker

634
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,440
a couple years ago they put out a talk

635
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
about detect

636
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,280
so this was their attempt to figure out

637
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,000
a way to

638
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,080
use miter attack for blue team and so

639
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
you go through you understand

640
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,679
what logs and resources you have

641
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,720
telemetry for

642
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,200
for detection you give it a rank of i

643
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
think zero to four

644
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,240
and then you map that to mitre attack

645
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,840
and you have a heat map now of all your

646
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,559
detection

647
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,039
um uh you know log sources so that you

648
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,280
can say what are our gaps already

649
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,200
that way when you're ready to do apt

650
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
attack emulation and you find gaps

651
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,440
well you know if it's just you just

652
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
don't have the the resources to identify

653
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
you know those endpoint uh attacks right

654
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,919
uh or you don't have the the correct

655
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,080
tool to to see lateral movement right

656
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
or you just don't have the right sysmon

657
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
uh content uh

658
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,240
or whatever it is right so start there

659
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,799
then come to this talk uh and so yeah

660
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,400
i'll link to that resource again in the

661
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,880
in the back of my uh talk so okay um and

662
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,600
then

663
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,120
what's the what's the outcome of all

664
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
this well you want to identify gaps when

665
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
you identify gaps then you can close

666
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,919
those gaps right you can create a plan

667
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,840
of action and get those milestones get

668
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,960
the resources

669
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
and then go ahead and close those gaps

670
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,600
so that's what we're trying to do here

671
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,080
is identify them and close them

672
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
yeah sorry for the blinding light but

673
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,440
this is attack

674
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,120
navigator and what i did here was

675
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,799
basically pull down from miter attack

676
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,640
apt-41 information and deep panda

677
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,159
information and what i did was

678
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,240
overlay them together and then just

679
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,080
filter out everything else so i can only

680
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,640
see

681
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,679
the tactics that they both have um

682
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,840
and the techniques that they both are

683
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
employing and then what's highlighted

684
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,760
here in red is just abd 41 what's

685
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,960
highlighted in yellow

686
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,280
is just a deep panda what's highlighted

687
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,360
in green is kind of the crossover for

688
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
both of them what uh what they both

689
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,640
shared um

690
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,440
well i mean it's wmi so you know that's

691
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,640
that's pretty straightforward

692
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,080
so this is a good way for you to go

693
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,000
through extract that cyber threat

694
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,960
intelligence

695
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,559
maybe you're working on multiple threat

696
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,400
actors and you want to ensure that you

697
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,679
can at least detect

698
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,200
write you know execution and wmi so

699
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,840
hey that's uh that's how i i did this um

700
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,320
you know

701
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,919
we'll get off this blinding slide here

702
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,919
so okay

703
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,880
so now we're at the gap analysis phase

704
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,960
okay this is always the least fun

705
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,120
version of breach and attack simulation

706
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,960
you found your gaps now you have to

707
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
remediate them

708
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,600
well the great news is you can probably

709
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
get your executive leadership to

710
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,000
buy into new resources so if you want

711
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
that new fancy tool the etdr tool

712
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,000
if you want that xdr tool or soar

713
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,840
whatever it is maybe you're going to be

714
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,360
able to get that budget because you say

715
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
hey look these apt actors which are

716
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,760
you know targeting other companies in

717
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,039
our vertical

718
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,200
uh we wouldn't be able to detect them

719
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,720
and we definitely would be able to

720
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,360
prevent

721
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,440
their access so what i'd like to present

722
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
is our gap analysis from our you know

723
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,000
apt

724
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,960
emulation plan and uh you know let's get

725
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,799
some resources to close those gaps

726
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,919
that's a good way to help them

727
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
understand the risk and once they

728
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,400
understand the risk

729
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,919
executive leadership will definitely

730
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,760
understand what uh what needs to be

731
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,000
prioritized in terms of resources okay

732
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
so that's our job as security is to to

733
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,840
do this and to highlight the risks and

734
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,679
the gaps and then put it in a way that's

735
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,559
uh you know

736
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,760
understandable to our executive

737
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,679
leadership folks okay so

738
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,280
one i just also want to set some

739
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,799
realistic expectations here

740
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,720
apt attack emulation it's not

741
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,480
bulletproof you know why because there's

742
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
bias in threat intelligence which

743
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,840
country created that third intelligence

744
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,039
which agency uh which vendor how old is

745
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,640
that threat intelligence there's so many

746
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,159
biases to consider here

747
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,400
that's why it's not a silver bullet but

748
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,799
nothing in cyber security is a silver

749
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,200
bullet

750
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
what this does allow you to do is get

751
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
those known knowns

752
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
out of the way okay in cyber security we

753
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,559
want to know

754
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,760
that we can see and detect and prevent

755
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,799
those known knowns

756
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,880
because if we can't even do that we're

757
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
already failing once we get that

758
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,799
stuff out of the way then you can do the

759
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,559
fun thread hunting stuff go look for

760
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,200
those

761
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,400
known unknowns okay do those deep dives

762
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,679
but you got to get the no knowns out of

763
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,799
the way and if you know your

764
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,320
your industry is vertical if you know

765
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,640
the apt actors the ttps

766
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,960
and you aren't emulating it you're not

767
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,760
seeing the gaps

768
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,960
that's the no known stuff right okay um

769
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,520
and then additionally like i said

770
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,120
throughout the duration of this talk

771
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,039
there is so much to cover here that i

772
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
can't dig into in 30 minutes

773
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,880
but i want you as the audience to go out

774
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
and do it and find those resources so

775
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,000
i've highlighted some of the key

776
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
resources here on this page okay

777
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
so go through this read some of the

778
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,240
articles align yourself to minor attack

779
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,799
understand cyber uh or center for threat

780
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,840
informed defense

781
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
and maybe play around with some of their

782
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,600
emulation plans um

783
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,960
all right well hopefully that talk was

784
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,080
informative

785
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,919
uh i know it went by pretty quickly for

786
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,200
me um but this is a very in-depth topic

787
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,120
and so hopefully the tools that i gave

788
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,400
you allow you to

789
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,960
quickly scope what threat intelligence

790
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,320
you need to acquire

791
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,559
what threat actors exist and then how to

792
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,480
create a plan of action to emulate them

793
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
capture those results present it to

794
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,159
leadership and do some sort of uh you

795
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:20,720
know

796
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,039
gap remediation okay i hope you enjoyed

797
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,240
my talk uh
