well thank you very much for inviting me

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,320
i've enjoyed the conference

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
very much want to just give a little bit

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,239
of my background

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,000
hi my name is keith chapman i work at a

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,120
company called belcan

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,640
in cincinnati ohio i work as a senior

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
cyber security analyst

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
before that i have been a lifelong

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,640
artist

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
i enjoy doing vector art primarily these

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,079
days

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,320
but i like all types of art i have a

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,399
degree in filmmaking

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,559
and i have been an art teacher in the

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,559
past i worked with first grade all the

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,319
way up to 12th grade

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,920
so i want to tell you about our

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,880
internship program we've been doing at

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
belcan

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,600
and we have a cyber academy that we

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,439
established a couple years ago

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,119
and in which time we've done classroom

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,240
instruction training for industry

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,280
credentials

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,280
and internships

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,280
so this talk is for you if you want to

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,880
see how imagination can be applied to

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
develop the next generation of cyber

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,039
security professionals

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,798
so my goal with this talk is to show

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
ways to incite the imagination of the

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,840
next generation so they can see

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
themselves differently

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,840
so how did i get here let me tell you my

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,119
cyber security

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,399
origin story i started off as

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,280
a computer hobbyist

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,200
i broke a lot of things so breaking a

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,640
lot of things allowed me to learn how to

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,719
fix a lot of things

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
and then from there i went to become a

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,640
cable guy

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,399
which i learned how to do a lot of

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
troubleshooting spent four years doing

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,640
that

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,680
and learned a lot of really solid

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,839
troubleshooting skills

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,599
one of the big formative ones though was

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,560
working as

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,760
a call center rep for an isp and that

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,440
was important because

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,599
i learned how to fix things that i

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,079
couldn't see and i had to use my

65
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,879
imagination to create solutions

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,080
for things that um i just couldn't see

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,920
because i'm over the phone

68
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,319
and so i was able to draw on a lot of my

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,839
experience as a cable guy and remember

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,359
what i see in the field

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,120
fix things i wasn't a big fan of working

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
in a call center but it was a good skill

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,800
to learn

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,760
and from there i enjoyed learning about

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,200
routers and i went to the help desk

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
on the help desk i learned about

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,200
incident response

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
and i got really interested in cyber

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,799
security at that point i would do

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,840
vulnerability management

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,000
and also trace down alerts that we would

82
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,319
get

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
from there became a system administrator

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,440
and i started taking

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,760
cyber courses with cisco now

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,760
at this point i'm wanting to go more

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,280
into cyber security but i realized i

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,840
kind of hit a block

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
and the thing was i really couldn't

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,319
imagine myself

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,440
doing a job in cyber security and so

92
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,599
i call that a failure of imagination

93
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,000
and i saw the same sort of thing when i

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,518
was doing an internship program

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,360
with the students that were coming into

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,080
belkin so

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,040
this talk is a result of what we learned

98
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,720
doing that

99
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
and how i think we can help more

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,200
students and more people wanting to get

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,799
to cyber security

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,040
so let's talk about what cyber security

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,159
looks like now

104
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,000
right now there is a lack of diversity

105
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,359
in cyber security which

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,040
tends to pre-create a lack of diversity

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,120
of thought

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,200
and the reason why that's dangerous is

109
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
there are new attacks every day

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,040
and there besides that there's a lot of

111
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,680
information responsible for learning and

112
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,159
there is a

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,478
constant learning curve the heart of

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,120
cyber security or information security

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,880
isn't technology it's people and that's

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,759
the primary reason why i think that we

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,560
need

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,560
imagination

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,120
so disclaimer i find imagination

120
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,359
fascinating i'm not a scientist

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,880
and these are just observations that

122
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
i've made

123
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,479
so one quote that was formative and

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,000
helping me to understand this a little

125
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,599
bit better was by

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,800
a doctor named dr murray hunter who

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,360
has a white paper essentially of

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,440
eight different types of imagination so

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,800
i've adapted that thinking to make it a

130
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,960
little bit more

131
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,840
applicable to this field and that's what

132
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
i want to share with you today

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,560
so back in 2018 we launched our cyber

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,280
securities

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,400
academy with belcan and we started off

136
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,559
with a technology school in cincinnati

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,440
this is a link to an article that was

138
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,440
posted

139
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,280
there are other articles out there all

140
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,440
of my links and my slides will be

141
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,638
available after the talk so

142
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,120
don't worry about writing everything

143
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,520
down right now if you're interested

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,680
so this year we've had 250 students

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,520
there's three school districts involved

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,720
and

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,080
we had interns that came in and

148
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,320
students that came in to learn more

149
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,400
about the program

150
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,159
one thing that we did to help get

151
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,679
everybody on the same page is we did a

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,440
pre-assessment

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,320
and what i mean by pre-assessment is we

154
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,919
would ask the students a simple question

155
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,680
do you play video games now

156
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,359
depending on how they would answer that

157
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,319
would establish a baseline

158
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,680
of how we could work with the student so

159
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,080
in that question do you play video games

160
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,240
it depends on what platform you play so

161
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,440
someone who plays video games on an

162
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,960
iphone

163
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,960
is going to have a different experience

164
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,680
if someone plays it on a pc

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,198
versus linux and the last two instances

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,400
they might have even built

167
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,560
the computer that they're playing the

168
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,799
games on so that might

169
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
show a different level of technical

170
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
expertise or

171
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,400
experience

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,758
so it's important to consider

173
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,120
what do i mean by imagination i mean

174
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,360
what do you think of when you hear the

175
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,520
word imagination

176
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,510
i like the definition that's on the

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,039
slide it's kind of put together from

178
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,039
[Music]

179
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,840
different versions of what i've seen the

180
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,120
ability to

181
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,560
form um a mental sensory experience

182
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,960
that is not generated by perception so

183
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,639
that means meaning making or comparing

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,239
different objects or concepts

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,680
or creating narratives and the reason

186
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,720
why this is important to me

187
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,160
is i grew up thinking that only people

188
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,880
in the arts were creative and my whole

189
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,639
life

190
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,719
i've wanted to be creative i wanted to

191
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,880
be creative personally i want to be

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,880
creative in my career

193
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,159
and so it really kept me stuck for a

194
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,400
long time

195
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
i thought my only option to enjoy a job

196
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,280
was in a creative

197
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,440
quote-unquote field and so

198
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,638
personally i always want to create more

199
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,639
than i consume

200
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,240
and i just didn't know that i could

201
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,840
still be creative and to be

202
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:44,240
in a field like this at first

203
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:47,599
but i learned that i was very wrong

204
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,879
so this is an image

205
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,759
of how my mind works i'm always looking

206
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,199
for connections

207
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,599
i'm always looking for the way that

208
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,280
systems work and i approach cyber

209
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,360
security the same way

210
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,479
i tried to bring back my i tried to

211
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,080
bring in

212
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,919
to the way that i work my background

213
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,919
as an artist and as creative person

214
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
one person helped me tremendously with

215
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,360
this was my wife

216
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,360
cynthia so she's helped me and my family

217
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,479
a great deal she's kind of like a life

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,120
coach

219
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,878
she encourages us to be who we are and

220
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,720
to be whole people

221
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,800
so to do that we've set goals as

222
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,399
for summer and in general to be

223
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,799
productive active

224
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,320
creative spiritual and community goals

225
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,478
and the reason why this is important to

226
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,519
me is i think a lot of people are really

227
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,279
unaware

228
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,279
of their true creative potential

229
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,839
so these are the eight types of commun

230
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,440
eight types of imagination that i'll be

231
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,480
talking about during this talk

232
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,120
we have creativity theorizing fantasy

233
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,200
empathy

234
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,680
strategies soft skills dreams and

235
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
memories

236
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:11,360
imagination is constructive

237
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,279
it can also be passive or can be active

238
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,680
these eight types of imagination are

239
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,720
adopted from dr murray hunter like i

240
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,319
said before

241
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,519
and he outlines how imagination can

242
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,839
synergize new concepts and ideas it can

243
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,399
consider and develop hypotheses

244
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,399
can create stories it can empathize

245
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,040
strategize

246
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,160
and reconstruct memories and it does

247
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,000
more

248
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,279
so we'll talk about all of these in

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,279
depth as we go forward

250
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,480
so how does imagination apply

251
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,240
to the field of cyber security

252
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,399
one way i think it applies is we're

253
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,360
always learning

254
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,399
i track what i learn i keep a list a

255
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,440
learning list

256
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,880
and i revise it constantly

257
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,279
and the other thing is there's more than

258
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,120
one way into cyber security there's not

259
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,120
one path so it does tend to allow a lot

260
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,760
of interpretation for doing things a lot

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
of different ways

262
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,000
and this is a diagram of of how i work

263
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,439
um one example of this is the way that

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,959
i cook my family has a love-hate

265
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
relationship with the way that i cook

266
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,880
food

267
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,560
when i'm hungry what i do is i typically

268
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,959
open up the refrigerator

269
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,399
and i pull out everything that could be

270
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,680
eaten

271
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,959
and then i assemble some kind of

272
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,800
hopefully edible meal from that

273
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,920
and it's not the perhaps best way to do

274
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,079
it that's the way i do it

275
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,920
and i approach my work the same way i'm

276
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,319
looking at how things fit together and

277
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,399
i'm trying to

278
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,399
imagine a good way forward

279
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,079
so the first bubble is creativity

280
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,040
i look at creativity as connecting the

281
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,640
dots

282
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,800
making connections combining information

283
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
and when we had our students as interns

284
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,519
this is um

285
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,640
what they would do is they would come

286
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,040
into the soc security operations center

287
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,800
and it wasn't long before they were able

288
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,800
to make connections from

289
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,560
what they read and what they were

290
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,240
experiencing

291
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,000
and then they would make connections

292
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,519
with different domains but when it

293
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,440
really changed

294
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,240
is when they started making connections

295
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,000
to attacks that they'd seen at home

296
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,519
and at that time they were able to

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,640
personalize it and

298
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,240
what we were doing went to a whole other

299
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,079
level for them

300
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,800
it's one thing to see an alert but it's

301
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,719
another thing to see the connections

302
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,719
and understand it by connecting the dots

303
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,920
theorizing is a type of

304
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,439
intellectual imagination much

305
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:05,599
of what we require much of what we see

306
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,279
requires making theories

307
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,639
and we take a look at a behavior and we

308
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,680
figure out

309
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,079
a best way forward so one way of doing

310
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,279
this

311
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,239
is by thinking divergently and

312
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,000
convergently

313
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,959
divergently meaning that you're thinking

314
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,680
of as many ideas as you can

315
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,359
and then conversionally where you are

316
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,839
taking all those ideas

317
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,959
and determining what's the best idea to

318
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,160
pursue

319
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,959
and you might not choose the best idea

320
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,199
the first time

321
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,079
so you just iterate it you keep doing it

322
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
again and again

323
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,160
but thinking in a theoretical way is

324
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,079
very important and information security

325
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,120
we gave our

326
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,680
students tickets to investigate and they

327
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
would get

328
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
very excited when they would find

329
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,800
something malicious

330
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,760
it's one thing to see a bunch of false

331
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,120
positives but to see something malicious

332
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:05,200
and approve is malicious it's

333
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,839
kind of a thrill fantasy

334
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,519
fantasy is another type of imagination

335
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,600
and in this case what we would do

336
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,959
is tabletop exercises they're

337
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,600
essentially

338
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,599
purple team where we are creating a

339
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,760
we're creating an event or creating a

340
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,760
simulation of a possible threat

341
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,600
in most cases what i would like to do is

342
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,760
adapt them from something real world

343
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
like an apt group

344
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,200
something in the news that we might see

345
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,880
and then we would fit it to the context

346
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,959
of our enterprise

347
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,120
so we would start with an alert and from

348
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,800
that alert we would figure out

349
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,360
what uh for example what miter technique

350
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,040
it might

351
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,279
be closest to like spearfishing

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,120
and so at that point we walked through

353
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,480
an incident response cycle

354
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,199
so by incident response what i mean by

355
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,920
that is

356
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,319
detection response mitigation reporting

357
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,399
recovery remediation

358
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,199
and then lessons learned so we go

359
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,120
through that process for each of the

360
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,399
scenarios that we're presenting and we

361
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,160
include the students in that

362
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,680
so they can see how we would really

363
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,719
operate on

364
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,160
a potential threat or a potential

365
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,079
investigation of something that would

366
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,319
occur in a sock

367
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,519
this type of imagination can be used

368
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,279
other ways also

369
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,279
including social engineering

370
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,959
empathy imagination so

371
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
we do a lot of security awareness

372
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,560
campaigns

373
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:42,160
and we work very hard to avoid

374
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,599
fud and what i mean by that is fear

375
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,480
uncertainty and doubt we want to give

376
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,959
people tips

377
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,880
that they can use at home and at work we

378
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,439
want to give people

379
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,720
behaviors to learn about cyber security

380
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,360
and cyber hygiene

381
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,360
that they can use in real life we want

382
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,560
people to see us as being on their team

383
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,600
and not against them so

384
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,160
imagination using your imagination to

385
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,360
understand others and to help them is

386
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,000
what this type of imagination is about

387
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,480
it's also valuable and something like

388
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,480
mentoring

389
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,399
strategy is more of a pragmatic

390
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,040
imagination

391
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,839
this is where you are imagining what

392
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,839
could be

393
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,920
we taught our interns to protect their

394
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,040
data with the same techniques that they

395
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,759
were learning

396
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,319
we wanted them to strategize about how

397
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,680
they would take care of something like

398
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,920
their phone or their passwords or

399
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,920
online accounts or social media so

400
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,479
that was another way that we could teach

401
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,519
them how to think strategically about

402
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,320
information security another way that we

403
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,440
use this

404
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,000
is we build out our strategy and

405
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,360
our security operations center one and

406
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,759
three years at a time

407
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,560
we're doing short-term long-term

408
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,519
planning

409
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,079
and that's difficult because we're

410
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,600
trying

411
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,120
to imagine what the next few years look

412
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
like

413
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
and if you've been in this field for a

414
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,800
little while you'll you'll know that

415
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,720
that's

416
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,719
a very difficult thing to get right

417
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
another way i think this could be used

418
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,759
is

419
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,320
in dealing with an alert or

420
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,480
a incident because a lot of them are

421
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,160
very complex and require flexibilities

422
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,440
of thinking

423
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,880
soft skills i think of this

424
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,920
as emotional imagination

425
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,480
so this is using your imagination

426
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,079
to manage yourself or skillfully

427
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,360
navigate through a social

428
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,880
situation or with other people

429
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,920
so in this example

430
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,759
we have someone who came to us after

431
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,678
knowing that they've been fished and so

432
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,079
a lot of times the person might feel

433
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,160
embarrassed or they might be angry that

434
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,198
they clicked on it

435
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,240
and what we do in these cases is we

436
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,079
de-escalate and we

437
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,480
assure them we're not we're not mad at

438
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,799
you if someone

439
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,959
is turning in a security situation to

440
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,319
the security operations center

441
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,880
we really couldn't ask for more that's

442
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,799
why we're here we work with the people

443
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
who encounter different

444
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,600
security situations and we work through

445
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,600
them we fix them

446
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,840
so this one's a little bit more

447
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,679
difficult i think

448
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,840
dreams and dreams to me

449
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,520
are certainly on the passive side so

450
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,720
passive imagination

451
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,840
so we're talking about actual dreaming

452
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
daydreams we're talking about

453
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,678
imagination where you're free

454
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,280
associating or where you're being

455
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,039
uncritical this is your unconscious

456
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,399
imagination

457
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,160
there are some things that you're going

458
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,640
to encounter that you just can't logic

459
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,840
your way through

460
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,240
so i think this is best utilized when

461
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,000
you

462
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,240
harness this type of imagination

463
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
in a different context like how do you

464
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,280
deal with a zero day

465
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,520
how do you deal with some situation that

466
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,799
you've never seen before

467
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,799
and have no way of starting

468
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,919
i think this one might be the most

469
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,280
controversial

470
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,880
so this is reconstruction imagination

471
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,160
i'm not saying that memories are

472
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,559
imaginary but what i am saying is that

473
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,600
memories are not externally sensed

474
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,480
and so they do fit the definition of

475
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,879
imagination that i used earlier

476
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,240
information security is such a knowledge

477
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,280
field that we have to

478
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,039
constantly work with our memories

479
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,879
and we constantly have to be able to see

480
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,080
things that we've seen maybe a thousand

481
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,840
times before

482
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,840
but to see it with new eyes

483
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,960
so again um eight types of imagination

484
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,760
we're talking about

485
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,480
creativity theorizing fantasy empathy

486
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,919
strategies

487
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,760
soft skills dreams and memories

488
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,559
imagination is a catalyst

489
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,559
creates action

490
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,960
there are some imagination pitfalls

491
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,320
so be on the lookout for this everything

492
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,919
about imagination

493
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,678
isn't good imagination is also a key

494
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,799
component of worrying

495
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:48,400
or projecting it also interferes

496
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,520
in maybe giving you a fixation of a

497
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,240
particular idea

498
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,320
or a way of doing things or by um

499
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,400
see what was the other one it also gets

500
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,159
in a way when you have a bias

501
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,240
you might have a bias that you just

502
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,840
can't see or get past and this is when

503
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,400
being in community with other people

504
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,959
helps

505
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,799
so this these are ways that we put

506
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,320
imagination into action

507
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,320
we encourage job shadowing

508
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,240
we built individual education plans for

509
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,678
our interns we gave them many hands-on

510
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,440
activities

511
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,679
we showed them our fishing workflow and

512
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,919
we got them involved in day one

513
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,120
and then this is key we would dialogue

514
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,480
through the analytical process

515
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,840
and then we included them in our

516
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
tabletop exercises

517
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,520
this is also very important when you're

518
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,240
working with someone who's new to

519
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,840
what you're doing it's important to

520
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,480
learn how to learn

521
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,439
so these types of imagination can also

522
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,000
be used

523
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,960
in things like shadowing or working with

524
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,280
a mentor

525
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,960
building a lab watching videos taking

526
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,200
something apart

527
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,960
studying for certifications or following

528
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,039
a to learn list

529
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,360
so we made a practice of regular

530
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,120
reviewing with our interns

531
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,479
and there was a time we had three

532
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,360
interns who learned

533
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,120
three different ways so for one intern

534
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,760
we gave them a computer system and had

535
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,399
them

536
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,679
take it apart and then put it back

537
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,240
together

538
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,559
and he did a lot better doing hands-on

539
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,960
types of activities another intern

540
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,039
was very good at reading something and

541
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,559
learning that way so we gave him

542
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,760
more book work and the last intern

543
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,360
worked well with uh doing projects and

544
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,559
so we gave him

545
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,080
um a project to do start to finish where

546
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,080
there's a lot of flexibility in what he

547
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,960
was able to do

548
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,600
so what i mean by incite the imagination

549
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,559
is

550
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,719
um in sight to move to action

551
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,080
imagination precedes action

552
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,840
and this is so much bigger than

553
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,158
information security

554
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,520
all of us are deeply creative and

555
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,200
imaginative

556
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,200
so i want you to wake it up

557
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,760
this is a student this is a quote from a

558
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,240
student that participated in a program

559
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,000
that was published in a local newspaper

560
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,360
and what i like about this is this is

561
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,320
illustrating what i've been talking

562
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,158
about

563
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,918
so students told us how much they like

564
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,280
the program even though they didn't even

565
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,360
really know what they were getting into

566
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,678
when it started

567
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,199
but now they're learning a lot more than

568
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,360
they thought they could

569
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,360
and what's interesting about this to me

570
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,399
is this is low level

571
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,158
fear uncertainty and doubt and so we

572
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,039
were the guides for the students and we

573
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
helped them to

574
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,158
see themselves differently to see

575
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,199
themselves in cyber security rules

576
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,200
and to really

577
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,320
generate more interest in going forward

578
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,760
now um many of you have probably seen

579
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,799
something like this before

580
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,120
but our interns quickly discovered that

581
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,440
we were only showing them a small part

582
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,439
of information security we were showing

583
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,320
them security operations but besides

584
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,799
that we've got

585
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,320
threat intelligence risk assessment

586
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,240
vulnerability scanning we've got

587
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,678
security engineering architecture

588
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,159
there's lots of ways into cyber security

589
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,240
and what i liked about the students is i

590
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,799
quickly identified a lot of them had

591
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,600
really great skills to build on a lot of

592
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,879
them really

593
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,039
had um developed threat modeling

594
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,080
risk analysis and social engineering

595
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,360
skills that would

596
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,520
work very well in this field

597
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,879
we do plan to expand our program so we

598
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,679
can offer students

599
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,559
other entry points besides the security

600
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,559
operations center

601
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,080
so i want you again to incite the

602
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,400
imagination next generation so they can

603
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,559
see

604
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,520
their future differently one story that

605
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,879
i love about this

606
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,240
is we had a student's mom come in after

607
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,039
the program

608
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,039
to turn in a badge that um hadn't been

609
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,360
turned in at the last day

610
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,200
so she didn't interact with us but she

611
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,360
did talk to

612
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,400
our receptionist at the front of the

613
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,520
building

614
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,320
and she told her that neither she nor

615
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,080
her son could have imagined this

616
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,200
experience that they went through

617
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,080
neither one of them had a context or an

618
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,720
imagination

619
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,799
for what cyber security actually is it

620
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,840
was completely off in a radar

621
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,080
and it really did change things for them

622
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,158
and that's what we're trying to do a lot

623
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,399
of students a lot of people really would

624
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,760
be interested in cyber security but they

625
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,760
just don't know how to imagine it

626
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,399
these are different ways that you can

627
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,400
grow your imagination

628
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,200
and these are things that i practice uh

629
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,080
for myself and practice for my family

630
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
um i like the list and these are some of

631
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,840
the things you could do

632
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,159
some things might be more interesting to

633
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,480
you

634
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,960
or work better for you than others but

635
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,799
do something boring

636
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,080
read fiction watch fantasy movies

637
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,960
listen to music without lyrics journal

638
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,158
have stimulating conversations ask

639
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,600
questions

640
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,400
vary your routines embrace chaos

641
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,399
be uncomfortable

642
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,320
so what i think is important about

643
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,439
imagination is

644
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,918
that it has a bigger

645
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,840
end result than i first thought it did

646
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,640
imagination is also important with

647
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,918
representation

648
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,320
so by representation what i mean is this

649
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,360
is much bigger than just skin color we

650
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,399
need a

651
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,639
more diverse resource pool one reason

652
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,840
why i think imagination is failing is

653
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,679
because lack of diversity of thought

654
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,840
and i've worked at places where they

655
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,720
they suffered because of this but

656
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,760
together

657
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,880
we can imagine things differently our

658
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,720
students need to see

659
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,720
faces like mine and yours

660
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,200
if you're just getting started and

661
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,600
you're not an internship program and

662
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
you're

663
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,678
not doing cyber security right now there

664
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,158
are other ways in

665
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,039
you can watch videos there are so many

666
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,760
videos

667
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,679
on youtube and other sources you can

668
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,799
attend conferences

669
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,840
ever since we have gone into kind of

670
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,720
remote work

671
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,000
because kovit i've been attending as

672
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,440
many conferences as i possibly can

673
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,520
you can compete and ctfs by ctfs what i

674
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,960
mean are capture the flags

675
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,080
capture the flags are normally

676
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,200
kind of pop-up events where

677
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,480
you are working to hack or uncover

678
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,120
or find information on systems it's a

679
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,159
great way

680
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,039
to learn or you could practice some

681
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,080
cyber ranges

682
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,919
cyber ranges are similar but

683
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,199
sometimes they're not competitive

684
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,880
they're just meant to give you tools

685
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,559
these two links i think are also very

686
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,000
important you can go to

687
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,240
this link on github for information

688
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,799
security or hacking for noobs and

689
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,240
there's a conference list for 2020.

690
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,080
i'm trying to get as many people in this

691
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,320
field as i can so

692
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,360
feel free to reach out to me on linkedin

693
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,279
twitter or

694
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,279
discord after the talk

695
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,439
so i i thought this was interesting

696
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,678
minority representation within cyber

697
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,960
security is a little bit

698
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:46,640
higher than it is in the actual overall

699
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,640
u.s workforce so it's 26 versus 21

700
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,720
but the thing is it's not consistent

701
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,840
representation across

702
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,840
all domains or rules for instance

703
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,840
i'm a security analyst and in my field

704
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,760
three percent of the analysts are

705
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,320
african-american

706
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,799
we can be better and the world's

707
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,918
depending on us

708
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,799
so imagine change

709
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,799
and take action

710
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,158
my slides will be available at this

711
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,320
github

712
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,840
link and also i will put them in a

713
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,760
discord

714
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,279
so i'm going to discord after this you

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,760
how much uh your slides are right up my

721
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,600
uh

722
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,879
right up my alley and my thoughts um

723
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,158
when it comes to uh

724
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,799
really growing workforce in in in every

725
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,120
way right

726
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,399
um the diversity of it the just sheer

727
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,879
accessibility

728
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,520
um there's there's so many programs out

729
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,240
there i mean

730
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,360
i i'm all for education uh right i'm a

731
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,960
formal education

732
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,559
but there are there is a lot you can do

733
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,880
without that too right

734
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,120
the barrier to entry doesn't have to be

735
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,000
um as great as many people believe it to

736
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,879
be

737
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,640
yes yes absolutely i'm still getting

738
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,480
certifications and i'm still educating

739
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,200
myself i i don't think it's something

740
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,000
that um

741
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,520
one size fits all for sure can you talk

742
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,559
a little bit about about that like your

743
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,760
thoughts on

744
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,960
again you know big big uh big supporter

745
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,640
of

746
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,240
um you know professional education and

747
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,960
everything else but um

748
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,120
but there are so many opportunities to

749
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,799
to get past that barrier of entry with

750
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,639
the certifications with

751
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,240
um you know there's a number of training

752
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,520
programs out there i've got one of my

753
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,480
own that i've been pushing

754
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,000
um on the side not part of grimm um but

755
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,159
you know non-profit kind of thing

756
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,679
uh can you talk a little bit about your

757
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,399
thoughts on that and kind of where you

758
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,440
see

759
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,158
um pushing other people into especially

760
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,679
into the

761
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,520
the jobs that have the lower barrier of

762
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,279
entry sure so

763
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,679
one thing i really like about that um

764
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,279
document of the cyber security domains

765
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,039
is there's a lot of things that you

766
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,600
might enjoy doing

767
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,158
and i'm a big fan of just learning more

768
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
about

769
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,760
how you operate and what space you

770
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,120
should be in so the way i look at

771
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,799
certifications is

772
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:18,158
they're kind of like a syllabus

773
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,600
it's a a plan a method of learning

774
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,039
something that you really want to learn

775
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,719
more about

776
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,720
and i've continued to pursue

777
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,360
certifications i've continued to want to

778
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,840
grow

779
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,840
and what i'm learning so i like them

780
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,199
that way as a plan as a way of being

781
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,279
accountable to

782
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,720
moving forward as a way of being able to

783
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,760
test your skills

784
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,960
i don't recommend getting certifications

785
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,080
for things you're already doing

786
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,679
necessarily

787
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,199
yeah i always try to kind of put a

788
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,880
carrot in front of me and move toward a

789
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,760
different direction

790
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,960
and i was my mentor told me that and so

791
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,480
i do agree with that

792
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,320
yeah i had a i had a mentor say

793
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,440
something similar to me um

794
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,120
i was doing something so i have a

795
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,960
technical background but obviously so

796
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,678
i'm the ceo at grim so i do business

797
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,919
things

798
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,200
uh and i run um two other organizations

799
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,440
as well

800
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,519
but my heart and my passion is really in

801
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,399
uh technical things and getting people

802
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,720
into

803
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,320
um getting into the technical space

804
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,519
specifically in cyber security

805
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,399
and there's just there's a lot of great

806
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,880
programs out there too there's uh

807
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,439
what's the retrain america i believe uh

808
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,519
came up

809
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,000
earlier this year so actually grimm is

810
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,480
uh is a is a partner and sponsor in that

811
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,039
um and and that's a great program

812
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,880
because they they're helping

813
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,760
people from all walks of life you know

814
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,559
janitors bus drivers taxi drivers etc

815
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,760
uh jump in and uh work on an aptitude

816
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,240
program and then

817
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,679
you know many people have the aptitude

818
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,880
to work in this business they just

819
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,080
absolutely

820
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,080
they just don't just because they don't

821
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,639
have any experience or don't know you

822
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,240
know the

823
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,640
the fundamentals it doesn't mean they

824
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,200
don't have the aptitude and so i love

825
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,559
i love pushing the idea that there's so

826
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,840
much more that you can really get

827
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,279
involved in

828
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,360
right right one of the ways that i got

829
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,039
in is i was at a practice for my son

830
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,039
where he was on archery

831
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,158
and somebody came up to me and saw me

832
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,640
studying and

833
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,080
offered me to use routers like cisco's

834
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,480
equipment

835
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,639
and then from there i eventually got a

836
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,519
scholarship through cisco to learn

837
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,519
ccna cyber ops and that's what really

838
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,440
got me interested in this

839
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,039
that is awesome well i definitely want

840
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,320
to uh i definitely want to link you up

841
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,440
to the foundation

842
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,720
um and to my staff over there uh because

843
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,240
they're looking for more people to get

844
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,919
involved with them and to help really

845
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,120
push this message message out in a

846
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,360
number of other ways

847
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,479
so uh if if you just ask one of the one

848
