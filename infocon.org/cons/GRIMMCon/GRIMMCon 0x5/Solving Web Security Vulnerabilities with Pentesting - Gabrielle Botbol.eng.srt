know what any of these talks are about

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,760
like every talk that comes up we're like

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,920
oh what is it

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
i'm going to talk about uh web

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,559
vulnerabilities

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
yes the number one cloud attacks the

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,160
number one attack service besides cloud

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,120
that like no one understands

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
web is my bread and butter literally

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,879
it's like

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,360

115 she's gonna take it away with some

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,720
web vulnerabilities

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,759
good luck you got it thank you very much

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
so hello everyone and thank you for

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,520
coming to grim con and for attending my

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,839
talk

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,040
so first of all i'm going to present

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,600
myself

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,320
my name is gabrielle budball and i am a

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,640
parisian woman living in montreal

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
and i work as an offensive security

38
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,159
consultant at desjardins

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,320
which is a canadian financial services

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,439
cooperative

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,280
and the largest federation of credit

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,600
union in north america

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,399
i am also a blogger and a podcaster and

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
i am the vice president communications

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,960
of norse conference in montreal

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
and i was recently honored for my career

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
and contribution to the cyber community

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
by being named one of the top 20 women

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,520
in cyber in canada

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
so to realize my project of becoming a

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,239
pen tester

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,520
i relied on an education science concept

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
by philippe you can see the definition

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,640
on the screen

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,360
it's called aprenos and my project

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
involves six steps such as

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
e-learning ctf learning expeditions

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,360
internship conferences and volunteering

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,040
and so in order to document this

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,599
approach

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,239
i created a blog to share my experience

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,879
and i also built an analysis grid

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,599
of skills that were resulting from the

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,879
whole project

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
and i achieved my goal by being hired as

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
a pentester in canada but

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
my desire to learn remains as strong as

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
it was at the first time

69
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,000
so what is a hacker so if you look up

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,959
the definition

71
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,280
of a hacker so unless you go to

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
specialized website the general

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
definition is petra active

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
you will find terms like snoop for

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
example and there will be

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,120
the notion of illegality but basically a

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,680
hacker

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,720
is someone who hijacks the use of a tool

79
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
to do something else so it's someone who

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,000
is curious about how

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,519
a system works so

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,519
um as you might know there are different

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,040
types of hacker you have

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,680
white hat gray hat and black hat and

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
here we are going to talk about

86
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,239
white hack hackers who are also known as

87
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,599
ethical hackers

88
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,879
and at the end we will have a fun with

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,760
a cahoot quiz

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,120
so what is pen test so pen test is when

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,519
you

92
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,000
attempt to break into a system to check

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,319
its safety so you will aim to find

94
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,080
vulnerabilities so that they can be

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,319
patched and there are different types of

96
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,120
pen tests and

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,000
i'm going to present some of them

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
so you have external pen tests we are

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,040
going to try

100
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,439
to break into the target system from the

101
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,799
outside of the network

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,480
but there are different methods for

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,640
doing that so for example we can try

104
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
to find out if an administration

105
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,959
interface of the target company system

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,600
is available from the internet so for

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,160
example

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
if you have the employees of a company x

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
who must use an application to take the

110
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
holidays

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,600
so if the login page of this application

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,199
is available on the internet

113
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,040
it could be hacked and this will expose

114
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,479
sensitive data so

115
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,040
our goal here as pentester will be to

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
try to connect to this application

117
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,759
and this will give us a first access in

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,840
the client's network

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
we also have vulnerability assessment so

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,000
this is

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
when we are going to use an automatic

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
scanner to scan our customer ip address

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,919
and we are going to

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
analyze the findings

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,039
we have internal pen test so for our

126
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,240
internal pen test

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,039
we attempt to break into a system from

128
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,880
the inside of the network so

129
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
once you are at the consumer location

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,320
you connect

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,120
with an ethernet cable or to the wi-fi

132
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
and you try to become

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,880
a network administrator and so an

134
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,000
administrator has

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,479
all the access on the system so it's

136
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,720
like someone would manage to steal

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,800
the personal data of all the people

138
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,919
working in a company

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
and we have a wi-fi test so we are going

140
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,919
to check

141
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,400
the wi-fi security like is it easy to

142
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,080
connect we are going to check if the

143
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
password is strong enough and if the

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,639
technology used are reliable

145
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,479
because some technology have been

146
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,160
depreciated because they were found to

147
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,280
be vulnerable

148
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,840
so a secure wi-fi will avoid that a

149
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,039
cyber criminal can

150
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,440
be legitimate in a network like any

151
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,199
other person connected to the network

152
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
so there's also social engineering so

153
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
some companies offer phishing campaigns

154
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,680
so we will do what an attacker would do

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
and will be able to find out

156
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
how many people read the email and how

157
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,960
many linked and clicked on the link

158
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
and so as a result the company will be

159
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
able to put

160
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,840
a better awareness policy in place

161
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,479
so for physical intrusion we are going

162
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,440
to try to break

163
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
into a building so we can either make

164
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,840
scenarios to try to manipulate people to

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,639
let us in

166
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,919
or breaking that dial for example

167
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,560
and we will have a target to reach in

168
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,440
the building

169
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,240
and if you want an example i made an

170
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,840
article on my blog name

171
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,520
codename2300 about one experience i had

172
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
of a physical pen test

173
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,479
and i will share the links on this card

174
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,520
afterwards if you

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
if you need them

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,240
so for denial of service attack um

177
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,560
so different attacks can lead to denial

178
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,360
of service

179
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
and denial of service happens when too

180
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
many people try to access an application

181
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,280
or service at the same time

182
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,160
so the application becomes unavailable

183
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
so we will test

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
them to evaluate the resistance of the

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,599
system to denial of service

186
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
so for a red team the goal will be to

187
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,520
mainly check the ability of a company to

188
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,160
detect

189
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,479
attacks rather than focusing on finding

190
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,758
a lot of vulnerabilities

191
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,319
and so also we can test

192
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,840
applications so for example web

193
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,720
applications and we are trying to access

194
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
sensitive data to become an

195
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
administrator

196
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,639
uh and we will use the most common black

197
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
hat attacks to do this so for instance

198
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
we have sql injection so it's an attack

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,319
that allows

200
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,560
to get information from the database and

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
the database contains

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,599
all the information needed to run an

203
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,440
application but i will explain

204
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,879
this more precisely later

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,360
so now that we have seen the different

206
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,599
types of pen tests i'm going to explain

207
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,360
the steps of a pen test so

208
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,520
there are different phases in a pen test

209
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,960
because when we test we do not go

210
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
straight to the attack phase

211
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
we need to plan it with the customer we

212
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,680
need to define the scope

213
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
and take care of the legal matters so

214
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
this is the planning phase

215
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
and then we gather information about the

216
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,639
target

217
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
how does it work what are the used

218
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,000
technologies

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
and this is the discovery phase and

220
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
after we attack it we take many notes in

221
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,000
the process and we gather

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,880
proof so this is the attack phase and

223
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
finally we produce a report with

224
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,519
explanation

225
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,920
on how to reproduce the flow and how to

226
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,479
correct it

227
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,440
so to go deeper i can share with you

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
what a typical day as a band tester look

229
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,120
like so

230
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,880
first i'm going to open my mailbox and

231
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
send an email to the customer whose

232
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
system i'm testing

233
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,839
and sometimes we have called to prepare

234
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,120
a new project

235
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,680
and we also have meetings with the team

236
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
to talk about our projects and how to be

237
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,360
more efficient in our work

238
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,760
but most of the time we test or we write

239
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,880
reports so

240
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,399
you learn something new every day

241
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,839
because every day you see different

242
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,880
technologies

243
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
but and this is what i really like

244
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
because i really like learning from my

245
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
peers are discovering new technologies

246
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
and trying new things on these new

247
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,439
technologies

248
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
so if you're interested in pen tests and

249
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,600
you wish to know which skills are

250
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,279
necessary i'm going to present some of

251
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,440
them so you have to be curious

252
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,519
you need to question everything you need

253
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,040
to be creative

254
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,720
you have to be persistent because

255
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,880
sometimes things will not

256
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,560
work right away so you have to try

257
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
something else

258
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,720
you have to be very organized and you

259
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
need to love learning and sharing

260
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,200
so share your knowledge with people ask

261
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
them about what they know because

262
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,519
it's always good to learn new things and

263
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,240
something

264
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,160
that was really helpful for me when i

265
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,399
was looking for an opportunity as a

266
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,600
producer

267
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,079
is my blog because this is like a real

268
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,519
portfolio of who i am

269
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,720
and what i do and i know so

270
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
a blog is not mandatory of course you

271
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,760
can for instance

272
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,399
write article on linkedin or or about

273
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
things you do or things you like and

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,079
share ctf write up

275
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,680
explain a concept you're passionate

276
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
about so it can take many different

277
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,959
forms

278
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,920
and what is good also is to go in the

279
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,560
wild meet people from the community

280
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
get involved in the community and go to

281
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,000
conferences

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,399
talk to speakers or attendees and create

283
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,000
an association with your friend for

284
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
example so there are many different

285
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
examples of things you can do

286
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,360
so now we are going to dive into

287
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
practice with the example of weapon

288
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,240
testing

289
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,880
so as you know weapon testing is a type

290
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,320
of pen test and now

291
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,720
every organization or business has a

292
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,440
website

293
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,760
but those website can be a nest of

294
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,279
vulnerabilities

295
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,079
so in order to keep people safe you can

296
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,000
help them by testing their website

297
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,079
and so in this example i'm going to

298
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,240
explain some web vulnerabilities present

299
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,839
some tools and talk about what i have

300
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,959
seen in real context

301
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,959
so as you probably know

302
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,279
osp is a non-profit foundation that aims

303
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,959
to improve the security of web

304
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,000
applications

305
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,079
and they have a top 10 of the most fun

306
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,079
vulnerabilities that you can see on the

307
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,279
screen here

308
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,200
and so we will talk later in details

309
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,120
about the first one specifically sql

310
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,079
injection

311
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,320
and directory traversal and the seventh

312
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,600
one and

313
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
i chose to demonstrate those because

314
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,399
they are very visual

315
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,600
so for the demo i used

316
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
mutillidae that i installed via meta

317
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,639
exploitable 2.

318
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,880
so you can also install mutiliday alone

319
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
on a web server but

320
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,320
if you prefer but this is a vulnerable

321
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
app so you have to be careful with this

322
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
and also before i show you the demo it's

323
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,240
very important that you're aware

324
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,920
that you must always have the

325
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,519
authorization of the owner of the

326
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,720
website to test

327
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,519
because otherwise it's illegal and so

328
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,880
the machine i use

329
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,279
on the demo are made for this purpose so

330
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,079
please

331
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,040
be careful with this

332
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,120
and so in the video demo we'll show you

333
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
the vulnerabilities and tools displayed

334
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
on the screen but first i want to

335
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,680
provide briefly some explanation on

336
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,800
those so that you can

337
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,399
completely understand what you will see

338
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,040
in the video

339
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
so cross-site scripting which is also

340
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
known as also known as

341
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
xss is a security vulnerability that is

342
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
typically found in web applications

343
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,760
so it's a type of injection which can

344
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
allow an attacker to

345
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
execute malicious scripts and have it

346
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,320
execute on a victim's machine the basic

347
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,399
success you can try to steal the admin

348
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,279
cookie

349
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,560
get complete control over a browser or

350
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,600
exploit a vulnerable plugin or perform

351
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,680
keylogging so that would mean that you

352
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,560
are able to record every input made on a

353
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
keyboard

354
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,800
so you have three main type of xss you

355
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
have static success so this is when you

356
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,760
are able to store

357
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,560
your xss payload on the database of the

358
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,360
target

359
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
and this way the payload will be working

360
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,480
for

361
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
every user who will access the page so

362
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,639
for instance

363
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,720
if you have a page on a web form you are

364
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
able to leave a message

365
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,600
that will be stored on the database

366
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,240
further to see so if your payload is

367
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,480
interpreted it will be stored in the

368
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
database as well and will be executed

369
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,040
on every time someone will look at this

370
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,639
page

371
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,720
so you also have reflected cross-site

372
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,920
scripting so this is when

373
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,240
the vulnerability only works on the

374
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,399
client side so the attacker will need to

375
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,120
trick

376
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,839
a victim into clicking a url to execute

377
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,600
the payload

378
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,720
and done basic success so a document

379
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,519
object model

380
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,279
is a programming interface for html and

381
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,959
xml document

382
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,959
and it represents the page so that

383
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,800
programs can change the document

384
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,680
structure

385
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,440
style and content so a dam based

386
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,399
xss will happen when the application

387
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,720
writes data to the document object model

388
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
without properly sanitized the input

389
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,000
so sql injection happens when an

390
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,880
application

391
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
uses a user controlled input to create

392
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,560
sql queries

393
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,639
without properly validating the input

394
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,800
first so

395
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
a successful sql injection attack can

396
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
read or modify

397
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,120
sensitive data from the database execute

398
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
administration operation on the database

399
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,320
such as

400
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,600
shutting it down and in some cases

401
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,639
issue commands on the operating system

402
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,440
so we have three types of sql injection

403
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,920
we have

404
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,079
inbound so this is when the data

405
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,000
extracted with the injection

406
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,399
is presented directly in the application

407
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,519
web page

408
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,240
so uh error-based sql injection will

409
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
belong to this type

410
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,639
and we have blind so this is when an

411
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,480
attacker is able to reconstruct the

412
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,720
database structure by setting

413
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,639
payloads and observing the web

414
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,199
application response and the resulting

415
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,680
behavior of the database server so for

416
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,399
instance

417
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,040
a boolean boolean based and time-based

418
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,120
equal injection belongs also to

419
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,079
the blind type of sql injection and

420
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,480
out-of-bound which is the least common

421
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,639
type of sql injection is when an

422
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,920
attacker is

423
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,160
unable to use the same channel to launch

424
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,079
the attack and gather results

425
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,680
so they would use technique that would

426
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
rely on

427
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,680
the database server ability to make dns

428
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
or http requests to get

429
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,839
the data from the database

430
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,279
so directory traversal is a

431
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,360
vulnerability that allows an attacker to

432
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,920
read

433
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,759
arbitrary files on the server that is

434
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,480
running on an application and

435
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
it happens when application place user

436
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,839
input into

437
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,720
file pass so with this attack you are

438
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,360
able to get application code and data

439
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,600
and credentials for back-end system and

440
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,399
sensitive operating system files and so

441
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
in some cases an attacker might be able

442
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,199
to write arbitrary files on the server

443
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,600
which would allow them to modify

444
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
application data

445
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,440
or behavior and so ultimately take full

446
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,800
control of the server

447
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,959
so depending on the operating system

448
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,360
behind the payload will be different

449
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,240
as well as the file you require for but

450
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
the ultimate goal

451
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
of this attack will be to take full

452
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,279
control of the server

453
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,959
and the most famous payload is the one

454
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,880
you see on the screen which is

455
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,880
going to work on a linux server

456
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,919
so the tools i'm going to demonstrate so

457
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,119
we have a

458
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,160
burp suite so proxy tools and further

459
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,280
um proxy uh

460
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,520
brexit is a proxy and the main goal will

461
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,799
be to

462
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,079
intercept and analyze or modify queries

463
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,640
and you have osb which is open source

464
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
birth city's proprietary there's a free

465
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
community version and the paid pro

466
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,000
version

467
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
and so as we will navigate through the

468
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,679
target application

469
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,520
the proxies will detect potentially

470
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,880
vulnerable elements

471
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
and we will be able to analyze them and

472
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,280
validate if they are indeed vulnerable

473
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,320
and also you have the further so

474
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,039
uh for instance derp so it's a tool that

475
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,400
is used to send

476
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
a series of payloads or in order to um

477
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
brute force administration pages or uh

478
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,960
pros in in a website so this can be done

479
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,200
with a burp intruder

480
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,840
or derb and so with burke intruder you

481
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,799
can try different

482
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,400
cross-site scripting payloads and an

483
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,240
injection point for example

484
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
we can also try to breed first an

485
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,520
identification form

486
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,799
and with dub you can list the

487
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,640
directories of a website with a

488
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,360
predefined list of words

489
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,600
so this is time for the video demo so

490
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,160
i'm gonna start it but i need to put it

491
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,880
in full screen

492
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,760
and i'm just going to

493
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,919
force the quality to be high and put it

494
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,760
at little so the first one

495
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,039
is stored excesses

496
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,679
so as you can see this is mutilide as i

497
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,160
mentioned before

498
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,840
and so we have

499
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,760
the famous blog example i mentioned

500
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
before and we are going to be

501
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,960
to have our input reflected on the page

502
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,280
uh

503
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,320
right after so

504
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,919
here we are going to try uh a payload

505
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,400
uh that will generate an alert and show

506
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
it on the page if it works

507
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,320
and so it worked so what we can do now

508
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,039
is

509
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,880
check the code source to see

510
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:53,520
to see how how it looks like

511
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,760
because as you can see here uh nothing

512
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,640
is uh

513
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,200
shown but it's because the our card has

514
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,919
been interpreted so

515
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,720
you can just and so now you see that

516
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,120
it's

517
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,159
just as if the developer was has made

518
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,159
this on purpose except this is our code

519
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,200
that we just injected

520
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,080
so now this is sql injection

521
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,840
so we are going to try to bypass

522
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,000
authentication and so we are going to

523
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,960
use another

524
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,240
a very famous payload with the two dash

525
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,919
and the end that will come on the rest

526
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,360
of the query so that

527
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,840
the password will not be checked

528
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,000
and as you can see we are about we are

529
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,120
logged in as an admin

530
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,799
so for directory traversal

531
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,840
so

532
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,039
so as you can see the the url takes a

533
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,720
parameter

534
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,520
and so we can try to uh to see if what

535
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,240
we can

536
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,559
do if we inject some payloads here so we

537
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,840
are going to inject the payload you

538
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,200
actually saw before

539
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,240
and we are able to see so this is like

540
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
a list of the users on the system this

541
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,280
is not a

542
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,159
password so to speak but it's still

543
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,280
sensitive

544
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,640
and now for birth suite so i'm going to

545
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,760
put the intercept

546
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,760
on and click anywhere

547
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,919
and then so you can see that everything

548
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,159
is um

549
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,240
you can see the the query what it looks

550
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,080
like and you have a cookie and

551
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,919
everything so you can modify it and send

552
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,120
it and you can just

553
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,440
drop it depends on what you want to do

554
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,120
and now about burp there sorry

555
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,960
so we are going to try to with a

556
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
word list you can find many word lists

557
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,559
online

558
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,880
and so every time we have a cut 200 it

559
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,159
means that

560
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,600
the page who are available

561
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,559
and so we have the index page which is

562
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,799
okay but we'll also have a php my admin

563
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,679
page and this

564
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,120
should not be visible because it's like

565
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,960
uh the a way to um

566
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,400
to uh to so the developer will use this

567
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,360
to

568
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,360
change uh things on the application

569
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,559
and uh so i really recommend to explore

570
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,840
kali linux

571
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,360
because um this is a a

572
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
linux version especially for

573
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,840
specifically made for pen testing

574
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,480
and so you only not only have web pen

575
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,080
testing tools you also have

576
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,480
more general uh pen pen testing tools

577
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,840
okay i'm just gonna put this

578
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,679
again and exit full screen because i

579
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,600
like it better like this

580
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,080
okay so now we are going to see how we

581
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
can write a pen test report

582
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,679
so um the executive summary

583
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,200
is the part where you need to explain

584
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
for the executive of a company who will

585
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,559
read the report so

586
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,120
it has to be high level explanations

587
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
with no technical details

588
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,280
and so it contains a global posture that

589
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,480
will explain

590
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,039
why the findings and attack combination

591
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,120
could impact the company

592
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,159
and the

593
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,000
the vulnerability report will have all

594
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,400
the elements you see on the screen

595
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,720
so you can also use specifically the

596
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
vulnerability report part for back

597
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,600
bounty report if you're a bug hunter

598
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,000
and the the severity you have to put the

599
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
severity in one word so usually it's low

600
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,159
medium high or critical uh the cvss

601
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,640
score or if you prefer osprey's creating

602
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,679
score

603
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,279
the detail uh of the affected d10

604
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,159
so for instance if you have uh found a

605
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,279
cross-site scripting

606
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,919
this would be the spot where to put the

607
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,200
link for instance to

608
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,120
to the injection point

609
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,279
so after this you have to give a

610
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,360
detailed description

611
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,679
with technical details this time on how

612
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,600
the flow can be reproduced

613
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,520
and an explanation on how to correct it

614
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,039
and finally

615
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,000
you can put the evidence so you have to

616
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,960
put the evidence

617
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
with like for instance a request a

618
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
response of the application exploitation

619
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,039
you were able to conduct

620
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,720
so there's also an article i made

621
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,640
on how to write a pen test report on my

622
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,559
blog i can share the link afterwards

623
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,879
with you

624
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,159
so how about what i've seen in real

625
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,240
context so i have seen a lot of

626
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,080
cross-site scripting so once i had to

627
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,760
test this website that was

628
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,159
uh globally very well implemented but

629
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,440
there was this feature of

630
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,400
file upload in which it was designed to

631
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,080
be able to download the html

632
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,279
file so i built an empty html

633
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,200
file and i just added the cross size

634
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,520
cryptic cross site scripting payload i

635
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,159
showed

636
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,279
earlier in the video

637
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,559
and that worked also

638
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,640
i have seen some sql injections so for

639
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,679
example

640
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,760
once the tool we usually use to dump the

641
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
database which is called

642
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,240
sql map uh was not able to find the

643
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,720
injection so i could not dump the

644
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,480
database

645
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,919
but automatically i mean but we found

646
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,159
a sql function that could show the last

647
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,240
request made to the database

648
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,400
and this was a boolean based sql

649
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,320
injection so we had to check

650
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,480
every chart one by one to find the

651
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,440
request

652
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,240
and so we made a script that ran all

653
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,279
night long

654
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
and we only got part of the request

655
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,039
because the request was thousand shares

656
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,880
long but it was still

657
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,360
very fun to do also i have seen strange

658
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,679
behaviors in application like

659
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,640
for example i had to test this website

660
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,440
but

661
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
when the session was expiring it would

662
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,440
really hurt me to

663
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,200
a connected session of the

664
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,559
administration tool

665
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,279
of the website so it was very surprising

666
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,840
and finally what i often see also

667
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,320
is the lack of click jacking protection

668
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,440
so

669
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,919
what i like to do when testing multiple

670
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,000
websites for the same company

671
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,960
is to try to show all the website in the

672
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,760
same page

673
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,799
in multiple iframes and see which one

674
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,600
will be visible or not

675
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,640
okay so now it's going to be time

676
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,880
for the carrot quiz

677
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
so

678
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,480
so you have to go to you have to go to

679
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,960
kahoot.iit

680
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,039
https.com.iit i can actually write it

681
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,840
on the discord for you

682
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,320
and you will see a game pin

683
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,399
and so you the question will appear here

684
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,520
and on my screen i mean and

685
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,000
you will have to answer to the question

686
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
from your browser

687
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,960
so i'm going to wait a few minutes for

688
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,840
you to be able to join

689
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,799
uh so you have to be very quick because

690
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,880
it's only 10 seconds to answer

691
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,399
so don't panic but try to answer

692
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,240
it's okay if it's not the right answer

693
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,039
we're here to learn

694
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,919
okay i'm just going to wait one more

695
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,679
minute

696
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,760
and then i i will go to that we're not

697
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,879
behind on the schedule

698
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,320
okay let's go

699
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,520
okay so first question what is burp

700
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,840
street

701
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,840
i'm just gonna

702
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,640
okay five good answer good job everyone

703
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,679
it's gonna be tricky

704
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,678
okay marilyn you're first good job

705
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,559
which of these payloads can be used for

706
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,760
cross-site scripting

707
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,960
hurry up you only have five seconds left

708
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,840
and good job many people got the answer

709
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,840
so he who doesn't hack seems to have

710
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
some knowledge even if he doesn't hack

711
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:27,039
good good job good job everyone

712
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,880
so which linux distribution is

713
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,960
specifically made for pen testing you

714
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,840
really

715
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,360
saw it quickly in my video demo

716
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,760
yeah okay you're very quick like you

717
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
didn't even wait for

718
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,120
okay good job everyone

719
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,600
okay so there's going to be a fight for

720
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,080
the top

721
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,279
true or false if an application is

722
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,360
vulnerable to directory traversal you

723
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,440
will always be able to access

724
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,440
etc wd i saved it on my

725
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,640
slide yeah good job

726
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
so this is a payload for a linux server

727
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,760
this one

728
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,080
okay so so tyrol just got on the top

729
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,639
and good job everyone keep going

730
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,679
how many different main type of

731
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,760
cross-site scripting are there

732
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,080
are there ten three four or two

733
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,840
so it's main types

734
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,679
yes good job

735
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,960
okay it's a little fight for the top

736
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,679
but it's still fun

737
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,600
so i'm able to extract data by

738
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,399
generating error with sql injection

739
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,480
which type of sql injection is this

740
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,519
is it inbound blind out of band

741
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,640
or in a rock band

742
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,480
yeah good job

743
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,399
okay some of you did not have time to

744
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,918
answer it very very quickly

745
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,399
so the first vulnerability of oh as top

746
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,279
10 is

747
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,799
so i hope you remember the slide i was

748
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,440
quite quick

749
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,799
yeah good job

750
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,320
okay so tyro is still on the top but

751
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,080
good job everyone because everyone is

752
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,918
answering questions so that's cool

753
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,519
so the phases in pen's testing of

754
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,640
pentest in order

755
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,080
are so

756
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,120
i actually spend more time on this so

757
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,840
yeah good job everyone got it

758
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,679
and so which of this is not a pentax

759
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,320
type

760
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,880
is it wi-fi in general external or blue

761
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,760
team

762
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,559
yeah i'm amazed everyone has it

763
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,480
okay time for the podium

764
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,279
so congratulation a key for the third

765
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,559
place

766
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,200
he who doesn't hack is the second place

767
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
and the winner

768
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,360
is tairo

769
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,480
okay good job everyone and thanks for

770
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,960
taking part in in this quiz i hope you

771
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,519
had fun

772
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,279
i always have fun watching you

773
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,080
up so now i'm going to briefly

774
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,120
uh show you some resources so

775
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,239
these are the resources

776
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,200
about the vulnerabilities on os by

777
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,080
mentioned so

778
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,760
excessive sql injection and path

779
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,320
traversal

780
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,960
and also when one wants to learn pandes

781
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,559
it's very important to practice

782
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,640
and you can find a lot of very

783
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,559
interesting resources so it

784
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,799
can be either directly online or by

785
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,880
creating your own live like the one i

786
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,279
show

787
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,679
on my video so for instance you can

788
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,919
start practicing with try acme which is

789
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,960
very good

790
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,679
if you have no prior experience and when

791
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,679
you when you feel comfortable enough you

792
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,000
can

793
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,039
stretch to hack the box and i also made

794
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,880
an article on how to get started with

795
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,760
pen testing so

796
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,960
i will send it afterwards on the on the

797
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,840
description here

798
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,559
and so before taking some questions i

799
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,640
would like to take some time to thank

800
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,880
johnny xmas for coaching me for this

801
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,480
talk it was very nice to

802
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,159
meet you and uh

803
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,240
that's it i'm ready for questions if you

804
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,720
have any

805
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,480
excellent talk so

806
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,399
let's see going up got johnny asking

807
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,480
how common is it to find stored

808
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,000
cross-site scripting out there

809
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,918
seems like a pretty basic vulnerability

810
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,960
an easy one to fix

811
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,480
um well i i

812
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,239
i don't really know i know it's not

813
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,918
uh i'm not sure it's that simple to fix

814
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:30,719
because

815
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,359
i i think that people are struggling a

816
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,399
lot with it

817
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,639
so what i usually recommend is to have a

818
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,760
look at the

819
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,320
tanya jankas book which is called alice

820
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,960
and bob

821
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,879
learn application security because it's

822
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,960
actually very well documented

823
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,119
and of course the os documentation is

824
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,079
very good help

825
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,960
for fixing this

826
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,000
see do you see any others over there now

827
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,520
any other sorry oh no uh

828
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,200
i think that was the only question we

829
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,880
got any more questions in discord

830
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,640
that's the only one i saw if we don't

831
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,240
i would like to ask what is your

832
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,160
favorite severity

833
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,920
rating classification system

834
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,760
uh funnel it's a cvss because it's uh

835
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,160
the one i used to use but i really like

836
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,359
to try out uh

837
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,599
the osprey's creating one because it

838
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,680
seems very good and it seems to be

839
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,880
you know uh more precise so

840
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,960
i i really wonder how is it in terms of

841
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,720
business impact uh

842
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,919
um specifically

843
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,560
so a lot of people don't understand the

844
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,320
purpose in using a purposefully

845
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,359
vulnerable

846
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,720
like imagebox app or website um a lot of

847
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,079
blue teamers will say well that was

848
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,760
already intended to be broken and a lot

849
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,200
of red teamers say why am i trying to

850
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,560
break something that i know is already

851
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,359
broken

852
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,680
so can you please explain the purpose in

853
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,400
using

854
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,640
intentionally vulnerable things to

855
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,560
practice hacking on

856
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,320
well it's uh i i hear that it's

857
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,079
i i can understand that uh it's

858
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,160
frustrating because it's not always

859
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,359
realistic

860
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,280
but uh also it's very

861
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,760
good to practice so i think so when

862
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,200
you're beginning

863
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,760
it's it's good to have some uh you know

864
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,119
uh vulnerable

865
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,440
things like this to practice and to hack

866
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,079
away but if you want more real context

867
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,800
you can also uh participate in bug

868
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,119
bounty programs which are going to be a

869
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,720
real context and you are going to test

870
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,400
things from the real life yeah i'll echo

871
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,440
that a bit by saying

872
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,320
that um when you're pen testing things

873
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,079
if you have like a payload or if you

874
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,000
have a post exploit module that you're

875
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,880
using

876
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,760
and it doesn't work like in the wild

877
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,119
then like you're asking yourselves one

878
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,800
of two questions did the

879
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,200
website or application sort the attack

880
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,119
or did the module just not work

881
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,960
so when you intentionally launch things

882
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,640
that you intend on using at things that

883
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,079
you know it's supposed to work on

884
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,839
because it's purposefully vulnerable

885
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,599
it gives you validation that if it's not

886
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,280
working in the wild it's probably

887
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,560
because there's a mitigation there and

888
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,079
it's not your payload or your module

889
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,680
that is in fact the problem

890
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,760
so it's useful for custom payload

891
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,599
development it's useful

892
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,400
for removing unknown factors from your

893
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,040
kill chain

894
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,640
in a testing environment before you use

895
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,240
it live

896
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,280
and um it's also useful because

897
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,079
if you can obtain a copy of an image or

898
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,440
like that's not intentionally vulnerable

899
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,280
but a copy of a box image that you plan

900
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
on testing

901
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,960
you can develop better payloads for that

902
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,839
thing because you've got samples of the

903
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,000
edr

904
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,520
and other solutions and mitigations that

905
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,040
might be on it to give you practice

906
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,880
getting around those things

907
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,440
so yeah those are really the purpose

908
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,800
that those things serve if anyone ever

909
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,480
gives you any pushback

910
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,760
that's why you should do it very good

911
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,720
points

912
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,200
jason has a question is what is a good

913
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,119
beginner tool to practice using

914
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,200
and reading up on to start learning pen

915
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,960
testing is it burp suite

916
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,920
you know birthshit is very good for this

917
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,119
uh

918
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,680
because you you really get to see how a

919
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,480
request is

920
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,599
formed and the impact of

921
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,160
uh when you modify your requests what

922
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,760
the results you get so

923
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,680
yeah i would say broadsheet is is really

924
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,359
nice are yours if you

925
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,960
don't want to pay for the pro version

926
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,800
you have the free community version or

927
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,760
you can

928
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,720
try osdap as well which is very good as

929
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,400
well and it's free

930
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
yeah and burp has an academy called

931
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,359
portswigger academy which is very

932
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,000
similar to what you find at tryhackme

933
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,920
where they will actually teach you in

934
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,000
lab version and then let you try it live

935
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,440
with you with their tool

936
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,520
so um if you want to get started with

937
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
web app pen testing burp is great

938
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,800
i think it depends on the type of pen

939
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,160
testing you want to do if you want to

940
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,680
get started with wireless if you want to

941
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,560
get started with

942
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,920
network pivot if you want to get started

943
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,280
with c2 if you want to get started with

944
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,000
web app

945
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,040
those are all going to be different

946
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,960
tools like people who are like oh i'm a

947
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,800
web app pen tester and i use cobalt

948
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,240
strike i'm like well cable strike isn't

949
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,680
really a web app tool

950
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,760
so you know the tools that you want to

951
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,040
get started with kind of depend on the

952
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,680
type of

953
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,200
pen testing that you want to get started

954
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,520
doing

955
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,119
all right so we're coming up on time i

956
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:13,520
see

957
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,240
vivec is already in the channel

958
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,119
excellent

959
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,880
um gabrielle you do have a request to

960
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,160
please drop your blog

961
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,720
links into discord people can go read up

962
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
on the things that you've mentioned

963
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,640
uh thank you so much for calling such

964
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,800
great attention to web app fantasting

965
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,320
i should see none of these basic

966
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,880
vulnerabilities in any of your web apps

967
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,800
now that you guys have seen this talk i

968
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,560
hope all i can say is look i beat

969
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,320
merrell in the questionnaire you did

970
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,079
god i meant to hit yellow i was like

971
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,680
right now i was like damn

972
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,839
well and then once you lose one question

973
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:46,880
you're screwed

974
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,400
there's no way you're coming back from

975
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
that

976
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,839
stupid well thank you for having me

977
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,200
and have a great rest of the day you too

978
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:11,839
awesome talk bye thank you

979
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,440
you
