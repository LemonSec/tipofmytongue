10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,000

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,239
couple years ago

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,239

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,079
uh this fall uh created my own framework

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,559

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,280
things are happening fast amazing

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
that's so cool well

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,559

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,640
introduced me but my name is nicole

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,640
hoffman and i'm giving a presentation

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,600
titled

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,479
jinkies this email looks suspicious so

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,560
there's been a suspicious email

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,479
sent by to somebody at mystery inc

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,320
and i need your help to unmask the

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
imposter and solve the mystery

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,680
and stick around and i'll provide some

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,960
tips to

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
help prevent this from happening to you

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,759
and your organization

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,600
so a little bit more about me why should

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
you listen to me during this talk

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,240
um i'm currently an intelligence analyst

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,320
at group sense which is a digital risk

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,479
protection services company

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,159
i personally deal with a

43
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,880
business email compromise uh probably on

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,079
a weekly basis

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,520
and so i just thought it'd be really

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
relevant to give this talk and to

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,959
uh like i said uh previously i recently

my a cognitive stairways of analysis

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
framework this is an analytic framework

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,200
to provide a step-by-step process

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,760
for performing analysis in tech if you

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,280
want to know more about it you can

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
and something about me personally before

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,319

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,720
moved to

66
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
the dallas fort worth area with my

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,239
family so we've been spending a lot of

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,920
weekends exploring and it's been really

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,640

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360

huntergirl.com or for hunter girl

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,559
without the eye

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
okay so let's talk about this suspicious

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,519
email

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,599
it came from scooby-doo and it was sent

86
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,720
to joe in hr

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,440
and it says dear joe i have a new bank

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,599
account i need changed urgent so next

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,640
paycheck go

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,720
new account please confirm change by

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,080
email only think

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,840
scooby-doo hmm this email looks

93
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,000
really suspicious and the first thing

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,640
that i notice when looking at this email

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,840
is the domains don't match so

96
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,920
this clearly didn't come from scooby-doo

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,200
because

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,959
they inserted a dash into the domain so

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,599
that looks

100
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,879
odd the next thing that looks odd is

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
scooby-doo doesn't get paid in money he

102
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,959
gets paid in scooby snacks

103
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,000
everybody knows that and i know

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,680
scooby-doo's grammar is

105
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,478
not the best but it's not this bad so

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,440
that's another red flag

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,639
and look at the unexplained urgency this

108
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,360
just

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
seems out of the norm for scooby-doo

110
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,919
the only thing scooby-doo does urgently

111
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,880
is eat

112
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,919
and really shaggy for that matter or

113
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,840
maybe run away from bad guys but he

114
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,360
certainly doesn't care about getting

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,759
paid

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,560
urgently so that's another red flag the

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
biggest red flag

118
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
is that um we have

119
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,800
at mr inc they have an internal policy

120
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
for confirming identification for any

121
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,600
financial changes or contact information

122
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,440
and it says please confirm change by

123
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,639
email only

124
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,280
if this was really scooby-doo he would

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,000
know

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
how to properly confirm the change so

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,199
this isn't scooby-doo

128
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,600
and scooby-doo actually doesn't have an

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,400
email

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,960
at mystery inc he doesn't actually have

131
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
a computer

132
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,680
his paws are too big so

133
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,360
all of these things lead us to believe

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
that this is most likely someone

135
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,199
impersonating scooby-doo in a business

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,600
email compromise trying to intercept his

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,840
payment

138
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,759
so let's talk a little bit more about

139
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,080
business email compromise

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,919
have you ever seen the movie the master

141
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,600
of disguise

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,680
it's a movie i'm not sure what it came

143
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
out um

144
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
but i watched it when i was little and i

145
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
just thought it was the funniest thing

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
ever and it was about a

147
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,759
a guy who was learning the family

148
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,360
business of being able to

149
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,600
change his uh into this special

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
disguises

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,880
almost at the snap of a finger and just

152
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,759
ridiculously unrealistically fast

153
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,240
and it's really funny if you watch it i

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
recommend watching it with your kids

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
um but that's kind of what i feel like

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
thread actors feel like when they commit

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,560
these

158
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,800
email compromise attacks is that they're

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
some master of disguise

160
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,000
that um they're trying to blend in

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,360
and you know manipulate people um and so

162
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,759
who better to unmask an imposter than

163
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,639
mystery inc

164
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,919
so that's kind of why i really wanted to

165
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,759
do a scooby-doo talk and the other

166
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,160
reason is i also say like jinkies

167
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,880
all the time during my investigation so

168
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,319
now i get to

169
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,280
say it during a talk so business email

170
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
compromise what it is

171
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,960
it's an email-based social engineering

172
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,160
attack where

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,240
a threat actor will impersonate a

174
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,160
legitimate employee

175
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,800
in order to interrupt or

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,720
reroute funds and there's two scenarios

177
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
that i typically see on a on a weekly

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,599
basis

179
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,680
there is the wire fraud where they'll

180
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
try to intercept a payment

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,639
to like a vendor or a company or even

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,080
like if someone's trying to pay off

183
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
their house

184
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,720
in a reality situation the other one

185
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,840
that i see a lot

186
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
is payroll fraud where they'll try to

187
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
access that person's direct deposit and

188
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,199
say hey i got a new bank account like we

189
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,840
saw

190
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
with the person impersonating scooby-doo

191
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
and these threat actors are typically

192
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,559
financially motivated

193
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
and they are ranging from all technical

194
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,880
abilities i've seen

195
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,039
well executed business email compromise

196
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,680
attacks and i've seen poorly executed

197
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,759
attacks so it really is not something

198
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,120
that you have to have a lot of technical

199
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,639
abilities to carry out

200
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
three of the main things that i see uh

201
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,240
for how they

202
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,039
carry out the attack is one is i've seen

203
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,400
them create

204
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,479
spoofed domains or domains that are

205
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
created to look like the legitimate

206
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,120
domain and they do this to try to bypass

207
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
the detection from the person they're

208
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,400
sending the email to

209
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,800
or private emails such as gmail yahoo

210
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,759
this is something i see more in the

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,879
payroll fraud

212
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,039
especially since a lot of the workforce

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
is remote now and they'll say hey this

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,440
is my

215
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,120
home email and then compromise

216
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,639
credentials

217
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,720
this is something i don't see as often

218
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
or maybe it's not as

219
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,280
reported but if a threat actor gains

220
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,319
access to

221
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,800
an email credential they can then send

222
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,639
out emails from

223
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,039
that person's email so who is at risk

224
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,599
well really everyone that has a business

225
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,440
email is technically at risk

226
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,519
but the two departments that i see

227
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,120
targeted the most

228
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,320
is hr who have the ability to make

229
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
changes to people's direct deposit

230
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,120
accounts

231
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
and accounting or accounts payable

232
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,279
somebody who has access to

233
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,880
make changes within an organization's uh

234
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,000
wires if they're sending money to

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,880
vendors and things like that so those

236
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
are the two people that i see that are

237
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
at risk the most but it's really

238
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,440
something that can affect anyone in the

239
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
organization

240
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,880
and according to the fbi's uh

241
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,519
2020 internet crime report in 2020 alone

242
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,240
the ic3 received 19369

243
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,120
email compromise complaints and the

244
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
adjusted losses

245
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,519
for those was just over 1.8 billion

246
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,800
dollars

247
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
and just for comparison last year they

248
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,839
also received 2

249
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,320
474 complaints uh identified as

250
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,440
ransomware

251
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,160
and the adjusted losses of over 29.1

252
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
million dollars

253
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,839
so just to compare nineteen thousand

254
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,720
complaints

255
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
versus 2000 so this is something we

256
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,920
really need to be prepared for

257
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,160
um and there's a lot of different types

258
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
of prevention strategies

259
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,320
that you can implement but i'm going to

260
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,279
start simple

261
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,920
and i'm going to be providing you with

262
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,120
five

263
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
prevention tips that i think could

264
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
significantly

265
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,519
reduce the the likelihood of a

266
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
successful business email compromise and

267
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,160
potentially save your organization

268
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,680
thousands of dollars

269
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,200
so let's look at the first prevention

270
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
tip

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,440
continuously monitor for information

272
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
exposure

273
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,320
if you find information exposure try to

274
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,200
mitigate it remove the data if possible

275
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,640
um try to

276
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
make sure that it doesn't happen in the

277
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
future

278
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,279
things that you specifically want to be

279
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
looking for is over

280
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,600
sharing over sharing on linkedin other

281
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,000
social

282
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
media are people posting pictures of

283
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,839
their badge

284
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,920
their job titles their emails

285
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,519
and and things like that how easy is it

286
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:57,839
for

287
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,760
threat actors to find information to

288
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,440
figure out who they need to target

289
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,640
to be the most successful you know

290
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
sites like data brokers or business to

291
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,079
business

292
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,120
databases these are sites that are meant

293
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
for legitimate business purposes

294
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,640
but threat actors can exploit them

295
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,519
typically for free or for a small cost

296
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,800
if you've ever seen these

297
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
and a lot of these sites have opt-out

298
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,079
options

299
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,320
which i recommend it does take some time

300
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,079
to go through and find them all

301
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,920
and it does require continuously

302
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
monitoring for this information

303
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,640
but knowing is half the battle so i

304
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
highly recommend

305
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
knowing how much information is out

306
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,279
there and are you

307
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,839
over sharing on your corporate website

308
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,120
how much information

309
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
are you sharing about your staff

310
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
specifically human resources and

311
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
accounting

312
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
and the executives how much can i find

313
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
just by going to your website

314
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
it you know try to put yourself in a

315
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
thread doctor's shoes and try to

316
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
determine

317
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,200
what they can find a lot of times what

318
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,399
what i have seen

319
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,680
is people will post like um company

320
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,920
spotlights or employee spotlight like

321
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,720
these are

322
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
you know i want to share about our

323
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,160
company which is great but then they'll

324
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
say like this is sasha from accounting

325
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
and she just started and

326
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,399
she's from ohio and she went to ohio she

327
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,639
has a degree from ohio state and

328
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,000
all these things are are great

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,079
they're they're innocent when you when

330
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,040
you're posting them

331
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,959
and and it's a good idea to share about

332
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,560
your company but just be

333
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,639
cognizant of how much you're sharing and

334
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
how easy you're making it

335
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
um and if you experience a business

336
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,800
email compromise try to go back

337
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,440
and and look for how much information

338
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,279
you can find about the individual that

339
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,519
was targeted

340
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
and credential exposures is something

341
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,519
another type of exposure that i think

342
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,920
everyone should be regularly monitoring

343
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,120
especially if

344
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,160
uh employees as they often do

345
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,600
reuse passwords if you know say there's

346
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,160
a

347
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,040
facebook breach or some app breach are

348
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,839
they reusing that password

349
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,920
internally and will a threat actor be

350
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,240
able to gain access

351
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
and so this has to be a continuous

352
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,160
monitoring i don't think it's a one and

353
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,399
done because information

354
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
can pop up all the time so continuously

355
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,519
monitoring mitigating and preventing

356
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:23,839
this

357
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,720
could could significantly reduce the

358
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,399
likelihood of these types of attacks so

359
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,320
don't make it easier for threat actors

360
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,839
my second prevention tip is to ensure

361
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:36,240
the

362
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
company has policies for the identity

363
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,880
verification when

364
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,920
you make these types of changes like

365
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,639
existing invoices direct deposit bank

366
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,680
accounts

367
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,000
contact information say hey this is my

368
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,800
new email

369
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,880
stuff like that like we saw with with

370
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,000
the threat actor targeting scooby-doo

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
if you have specific policies and

372
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
procedures in place

373
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,519
it's more more likely that uh you know

374
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,639
uh

375
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,959
these types of things won't just happen

376
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,000
because they'll know

377
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,639
i need to make sure this is verified

378
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,800
personally i like to have a plan a

379
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,320
a plan b and a plan c with identity

380
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
verification

381
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
you know you can verify over the phone

382
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,560
with a known phone number for that

383
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,480
individual not a phone number

384
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
provided within the email like in the

385
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,480
signature

386
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,360
or or the website you don't want to use

387
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,240
that information

388
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,079
if you don't have the specific phone

389
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,079
number for the individual

390
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,360
that is trying to contact you try to get

391
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,839
a

392
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,639
known contact at that company or even

393
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,000
just google the company try

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
to use their main line you just don't

395
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,199
want to

396
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,680
use anything provided in the email if

397
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,600
you're suspicious uh that it might be a

398
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,839
business email compromise

399
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,240
uh the plan b would be in person if at

400
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,079
all possible

401
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,000
if it's a remote workforce obviously

402
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
that's that's something that can happen

403
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,639
and then plan c i recommend having

404
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,199
something

405
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,519
specific and unique to your organization

406
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,639
that changes regularly but not too much

407
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,399
because if you change it too much

408
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,920
then people are just going to be annoyed

409
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,040
by it and they're not going to pay

410
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,399
attention but

411
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
if it's if it's regular enough at least

412
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,440
change it when someone if someone leaves

413
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
the company then let's go ahead and

414
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,639
update that whether it be

415
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,519
like a code word or just some type of

416
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,519
unique thing that you can add like an

417
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,199
additional layer of identity

418
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,639
verification

419
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,560
and you know hearing code word

420
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,600
it might sound like childish or that

421
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
doesn't seem like it's going to work but

422
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,560
in reality something so simple could

423
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,360
actually

424
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,560
you know prevent this type of attack

425
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,800
so think about it you know think about

426
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,639
having multiple plans

427
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,560
not just one form of identity

428
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
verification because there's always

429
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,959
going to be

430
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,120
exceptions and you don't want to have

431
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
too many plans or too many

432
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,160
uh backup plans because that is just

433
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,519
going to be annoying and they're not

434
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,560
going to you know

435
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,959
be able to remember all of them so just

436
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,000
have enough

437
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,800
to try to cover exceptions and things

438
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
like that

439
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,120
so there's always a plan in place

440
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,880
so my third prevention tip is education

441
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
now i highly recommend educating the

442
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,040
entire staff

443
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,320
on not only regular phishing attacks but

444
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,880
also

445
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,759
business email compromise attack because

446
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,240
it's

447
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,880
these types of attacks are different

448
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
than the normal

449
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,800
um phishing attacks that you see in the

450
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,279
wild

451
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,040
because typically when there's a

452
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
phishing attack

453
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,320
the threat actors are fishing for

454
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
information they're trying to

455
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,720
get information or they're trying to

456
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
manipulate you into like clicking on

457
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,160
something

458
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,920
and so a lot of the phishing awareness

459
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,320
training that i see is specific

460
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,760
to um you know trying to get

461
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,599
credentials or are you trying to get you

462
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,199
to open something malicious and it

463
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,119
doesn't really cover

464
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,679
business email compromise and when the

465
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,520
the threat actor is actually going after

466
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,240
money

467
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,439
instead of information or you know

468
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,359
trying to get you to download malware so

469
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,799
i highly recommend

470
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,000
specifically for the human resources and

471
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,439
accounting departments

472
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,880
to incorporate specific business email

473
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
compromise

474
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,480
examples into your training and

475
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,880
also if you do fishing awareness or if

476
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,760
not fishing awareness excuse me um

477
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,799
fishing uh simulations like for

478
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,760
training i highly recommend not only

479
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,320
doing

480
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,799
you know the typical phishing but also

481
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,440
including

482
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,760
a specific business email compromise and

483
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
to the most targeted people in the

484
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,120
organization

485
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,039
because it could definitely help prevent

486
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,440
the the attack because this type of

487
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,000
attack exploits the network's

488
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,320
weakest link which is the people and it

489
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,240
relies on manipulating people

490
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,880
and we're never going to be able to say

491
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,039
we're 100 percent covered from this

492
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,160
threat but we can do all that we can

493
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,960
so that we can hope to prevent the

494
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,520
likelihood

495
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,520
so my fourth prevention tip is to

496
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,559
continuously

497
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,679
monitor for newly created spoofed

498
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,799
domains

499
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,000
that specifically have mail servers set

500
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,559
up

501
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,120
because a lot of times what i will see

502
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,600
is

503
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,640
a threat actor will create a domain

504
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,039
that looks exactly like a legitimate

505
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,880
domain whether you call that a spoof

506
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,600
domain

507
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
typo squatted domain whatever you want

508
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,280
to call it

509
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,000
they'll set it up they'll register it

510
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,559
they'll

511
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,640
set up mail servers they'll create the

512
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,679
email

513
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,679
of the individual that they're trying to

514
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,760
impersonate and they'll carry out their

515
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,320
attack typically within a few days

516
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,559
so making sure that you're monitoring

517
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,600
for these

518
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
um and because knowing is half the

519
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,600
battle and something

520
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,720
like this you want to just be

521
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,440
continuously monitoring for anyway

522
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,960
because there's other things that could

523
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,240
potentially impact your organization

524
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,200
so no scooby-doo talk would be complete

525
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
without a trip to the kitchen

526
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
because that's typically where you're

527
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,360
gonna find

528
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,080
shaggy and scooby during any mystery

529
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
solving investigation

530
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,039
so i had to go into the kitchen to see

531
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,799
scooby and shaggy's epic

532
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,480
sandwich creation so for my fifth

533
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,679
prevention tip i really recommend being

534
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,200
wary of unexplained urgency and requests

535
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,160
for

536
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,039
payments or financial changes even

537
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,080
contact changes

538
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
any unexplained urgency should be

539
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,799
immediately a red flag

540
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,679
and for me if i see any unexplained

541
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,480
urgency

542
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,440
i would immediately stop communicating

543
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,880
with that individual

544
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,360
over email and start my identity

545
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
verification procedures that i have in

546
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
place

547
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,480
because it might be

548
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,159
it might take a couple extra steps it

549
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,240
might be inconvenient but security isn't

550
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,440
supposed to be convenient

551
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
and if it can save the company hundreds

552
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,720
of thousands of dollars

553
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,840
i would do that so i highly recommend

554
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,640
in your training for business email

555
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,360
compromise

556
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,320
to add the red flag of unexplained

557
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,120
urgency

558
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,320
because threat actors often not just in

559
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,919
business email compromise but other

560
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,679
types of phishing attacks

561
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,679
they'll often use unexplained urgency

562
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,039
they'll they'll impersonate a

563
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,000
person that's in a position of power and

564
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,320
they'll

565
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,960
they'll use that urgency and authority

566
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,120
to try to manipulate people into doing

567
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,080
something quicker

568
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,039
so that they don't have time to just you

569
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:05,520
know

570
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,320
think about it and and identify any red

571
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,280
flags

572
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,799
um and that's what they're hoping for so

573
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,960
be wary of that unexplained urgency and

574
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,000
requests

575
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
and especially if it's coming from a

576
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,320
person of power

577
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,480
start looking immediately for any red

578
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:30,720
flags in the email

579
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,520
why it's old man withers the guy that

580
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,880
with the haunted

581
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,360
uh amusement park he was behind the

582
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
attack the whole time

583
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,559
and he would have gotten away with it if

584
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,880
it wasn't for those meddling kids

585
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,039
so this is hopefully what a threat actor

586
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,080
will say if you implement these five

587
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,799
prevention

588
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,559
tips so just just to wrap it up

589
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,960
and and kind of reiterate the five steps

590
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,880
is you want to be continuously

591
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,840
monitoring for information exposure

592
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,480
i highly recommend you regularly google

593
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,000
your company

594
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
google uh people that are specifically

595
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,000
targeted

596
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,919
um like you know people in your

597
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,080
accounting department your executives

598
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
people and human resources how much

599
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,440
information

600
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,080
is out there and how easy is it for a

601
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
threat actor to

602
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,360
carry out this attack with little to no

603
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,320
resource

604
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,799
excuse me little to no resources and

605
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,919
number two

606
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,679
you know ensure you have company

607
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,520
policies and procedures in place

608
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,559
not only for uh verifying identities

609
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,159
but also for responding to

610
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,679
business email compromise or if there's

611
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,200
an expected phishing email how

612
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,480
do they continue or how do they report

613
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,760
those so make sure you have those

614
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,600
policies in place

615
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,480
and number three education you want to

616
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,280
make sure you have a well-thought-out

617
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,158
cybersecurity

618
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,559
phishing awareness training but also

619
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,919
specifically for

620
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,159
business email compromise because it's a

621
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,919
lot different than other types

622
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,600
of phishing attacks because it

623
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,520
typically happens when a threat actor is

624
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
fishing for money and not so much

625
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,720
information

626
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,320
or trying to give give out malware or

627
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,919
anything like that so the training

628
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,679
should be different

629
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,520
and included specifically for those

630
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
people in human resources

631
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,919
and accounting and number four

632
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,159
continuously monitoring for those newly

633
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,600
created

634
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,840
suspicious spoofed domains that look

635
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,760
eerily like your domain that a threat

636
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,960
actor

637
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
might use to detect or to bypass

638
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
detection from someone

639
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,799
if they're not paying attention closely

640
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,440
enough pay attention to those

641
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
specifically the ones that set up mail

642
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,120
servers

643
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,600
if you experience a business email

644
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,880
compromise

645
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,520
and they are using a spoof domain you

646
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,000
can

647
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,360
reach out to that domain registry

648
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,120
you can request that they take it down

649
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,679
you could you know share the information

650
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,880
about it

651
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,799
um typically most of the domain

652
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,960
registries do have a way of reporting

653
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,360
abuse so you can go ahead and do that

654
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,919
and number five you know be wary of that

655
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:16,720
unexplained

656
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,039
urgency and requests for payments and

657
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,640
and financial changes

658
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,000
really just any unexplained urgency

659
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,840
specifically if it's from someone in

660
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,440
power

661
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,200
so i'm going to make my slides available

662
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,120
after my talk on my blog at

663
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,679
threehundredgirl.com later

664
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,000
this evening i'll post it on social

665
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,760
media as well as discord

666
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,640
um that when it's live if you don't

667
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
follow social media you can just go

668
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,080
ahead and navigate to my blog

669
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,039
later i collected some helpful resources

670
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,840
that

671
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,320
were you are useful for me on on a daily

672
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,159
basis but also really interesting when i

673
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,240
was creating this presentation

674
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,039
um specifically i wanted to point out

675
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,559
the

676
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,880
bloomberg article by evan ratcliffe and

677
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,000
it's called the fall

678
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
of the billionaire gucci master it just

679
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,480
recently published it's really

680
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,200
interesting it's about a guy who

681
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
was carrying out business email

682
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
compromise and he ended up making

683
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
millions of dollars and became an

684
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,520
influencer

685
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,640
and so highly recommend that uh read if

686
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,679
you can access it

687
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,120
so that wraps it up for me uh i think

688
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,559
i'm really early

689
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,720
but better better to be early than late

690
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,400
so thank you everyone thank you grim

691
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
khan for helping me solve the mystery of

692
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,760
this uh

693
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,840
business email compromise impacting poor

694
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,720
scooby-doo

695
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,919
i mean we knew it was going to be old

696
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,640
man withers we knew

697
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
we knew it always is you pull it off and

698
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,279
there he is every time

699
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,039
yeah i had to i was like that's got to

700
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,880
be old man withers i can't have a scooby

701
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,840
talk

702
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,480
without the old man withers so i'm going

703
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,159
to create an award on the spot

704
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,400
uh for the five conferences we've had

705
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,880
this is the best aesthetic we've ever

706
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
had on a slide

707
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
this is this was awesome it was

708
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,760
incredible it was incredible

709
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,640
yes i i you got i gotta love uh

710
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,600
powerpoints

711
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,080
uh 3d models and stuff the only thing

712
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,000
the tip that i will say to for people is

713
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,480
if you're

714
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,240
using the 3d models and you're using a

715
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,520
bunch of them to kind of create a

716
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,080
scenario

717
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
like a scene after you're done with the

718
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,799
slide take a screenshot

719
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,480
erase the slide and then post the

720
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,640
screenshot because it makes powerpoint

721
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
like crash if you're using too many 3d

722
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,799
models so

723
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,200
good to know but good for if you're

724
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,100
trying to avoid copyright infringement

725
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,919
[Laughter]

726
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,640
excellent are you good to be yeah so uh

727
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,320
tell us about the the podcast actually

728
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,520
by the way by the way you mentioned that

729
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,120
before

730
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,159
yes so i'm starting a podcast um i was

731
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,240
hoping to start it sooner but then i

732
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
ended up moving to texas a little sooner

733
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
so once my house is built i'm gonna have

734
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,240
my own little podcast studio

735
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
uh the podcast is going to be called

736
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,520
itwolfs

737
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,120
and i'm actually starting it with my

738
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,799
husband his name's bruce

739
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,080
he's in the cyberspace as well he's not

740
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,600
as active on twitter but he

741
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,399
is a senior cyber security engineer

742
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,559
architect so he's really

743
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,200
on the engineering side whereas i'm more

744
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,440
you know on the analytic

745
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
intelligence side so i just we thought

746
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,640
it'd be really interesting

747
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,360
to start a podcast where we kind of

748
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,200
discuss topics from both of our points

749
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,120
of view because i feel like a lot of

750
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,279
times when i'm giving intelligence

751
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,559
advice to my clients and other in

752
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,480
other people in the field that there's

753
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,559
this

754
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,799
there's this area that's that's missing

755
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,799
from an operational like engineering

756
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,600
like

757
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,039
i'm going to give you what i think is

758
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,360
the best but is it the best

759
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,440
for your organization you know what are

760
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,399
those things that

761
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,960
i don't see because i'm not you know

762
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,039
messing with firewalls every day and you

763
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,640
know especially things like patch

764
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,840
management

765
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
and there's a lot of debate around that

766
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,000
and there's always the best practices

767
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,200
from intelligence

768
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,760
side but you know what is the realistic

769
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,120
side so

770
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,520
i'm really excited about it it should be

771
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,039
launching sometime towards the end of

772
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,039
the year

773
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,720
it's super exciting and really

774
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,799
interesting i i always love those

775
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,120
uh podcasts or shows that have that

776
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,399
dichotomy of like

777
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,799
the same scenario but two completely

778
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,480
different perspectives i think it's so

779
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,720
interesting

780
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,880
yeah i'm hoping it'll be pretty casual i

781
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,760
don't want it to be

782
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,600
i want it to be kind of a fun way to

783
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
like continuously share

784
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,640
um tips and stuff without it being too

785
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,399
like businessy so

786
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,520
hopefully lots of husband and wife

787
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,880
bickering over over

788
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,360
cyber security topics but in a fun in

789
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,200
the best way possible and hopefully have

790
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,840
some

791
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,799
other cyber security people on there to

792
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,919
talk about different fun

793
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,120
topics jinkies

794
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,320
yeah stinkies uh

795
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,799
just a thought on this your uh the

796
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,320
recording of this would be

797
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,360
uh an excellent employee training tool

798
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,120
yes oh well thank you that

799
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,880
that makes me feel good yeah and and

800
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,320
that's kind of another reason why i

801
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,120
wanted to mention

802
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,720
that or i want to create this talk is

803
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,960
because when i

804
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
see phishing training it's always the

805
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
same you know

806
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,679
ransomware based or don't click the link

807
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,600
which is great we need that

808
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,520
but this is something that can also be

809
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,640
just as damaging financially

810
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,159
so we want to make sure i know when i

811
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,159
was when i was uh making the talk i

812
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,520
reached out to a couple of my friends

813
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,360
that are not in tech they're actually in

814
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,559
the financial sector

815
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,000
and they had no idea what business email

816
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,960
compromise was so

817
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,480
and they're the ones getting targeted

818
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,640
the most exactly so that's definitely

819
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,799
something i i want to scream from the

820
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,640
room tops about to try to prevent this

821
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,200
from happening

822
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,600
uh question for the audience can you

823
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,840
address the recent issues around fishing

824
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,880
education

825
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,720
that trick employees and why people

826
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,240
should be thinking about these issues so

827
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,200
some of the ethics

828
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,559
of fishing training

829
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,679
well i say this a lot and i said this in

830
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,520
a talk i recently gave

831
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,279
um is we shouldn't be fear-mongering

832
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,320
education should be empowering because

833
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,760
if people are scared

834
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,360
it's it's they're not going to want to

835
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,440
report things and you want people to

836
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,799
report things you want people to know

837
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,559
that you're on their side

838
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,880
if they see something report it even if

839
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
they clicked on it

840
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,399
they shouldn't live in fear because when

841
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,760
they do they're not going to report it

842
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,960
things aren't going to happen

843
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,760
and if they feel empowered you know even

844
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,240
through the use of like gamification you

845
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,960
know

846
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,720
have awards or something even if it's

847
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,480
just like a little snickers bar like

848
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,880
make people feel excited to identify

849
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,279
threats

850
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,480
yeah that's great advice the positive

851
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,559
criticism rather than the

852
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,440
you know yes bad bad bad yes a

853
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,559
reinforcement that's sort of

854
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,320
negative reinforcement versus positive

855
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,679
reinforcement yeah

856
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,880
exactly don't fear monger i

857
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,440
understand why people do it because they

858
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,320
think it'll get

859
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
what they want and it might but is it

860
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,679
the best thing because

861
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,039
really at the end of the day we want to

862
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,720
bring cyber security and other

863
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,480
departments together not

864
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,559
further apart we want to get rid of the

865
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,039
attitude that it's just a money pit that

866
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,200
nobody that makes our life harder that

867
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,240
shouldn't be

868
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,279
the the mantra

869
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,880
yep great points

870
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,279
bring everybody together bring everybody

871
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,320
together

872
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,880
educate and inspire instead of tearing

873
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,320
people down

874
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,399
yes cyber security should be part of the

875
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,840
values of the company it should be

876
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,519
company-wide it shouldn't just be

877
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,840
something on the back burner

878
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,360
yes well and also uh i think that helps

879
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,279
set up more of a service-oriented

880
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,120
security relationship too often security

881
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,840
is the

882
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,640
the culture in the place of no and at

883
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,080
the end of the day

884
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,240
uh users are going to get done what they

885
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,000
need to get done i i joke that

886
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
users are the best a user that you say

887
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,679
no to is the best hacker on the planet

888
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,760
because they will find a way around

889
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,600
whatever controls you have

890
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,279
and phishing and business email

891
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,720
compromise of course are

892
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,559
the most common access methods for

893
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,320
initial access because

894
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,120
you only need one click i can it cost me

895
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,799
just as much to send 10 million emails

896
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,039
as it does to send one email

897
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,320
and we blame the user for

898
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,240
essentially using a computer for how it

899
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,880
was designed

900
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,240
exactly and that's why

901
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,000
you want to have you know those

902
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,240
procedures in place that are simple

903
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,919
easily accessible easy to remember

904
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,519
because if you have too many

905
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,559
they're not going to remember it they're

906
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,480
going to try to get around it just like

907
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,399
if you use i've seen companies use like

908
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,919
a daily code word

909
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,159
which is great but it gets old after a

910
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,360
while and then people are just going to

911
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,320
be annoyed by it so you want to make it

912
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,600
easy simple not something that they're

913
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
going to try to get around if

914
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,840
if possible

915
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
absolutely i mean i think that's like

916
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,919
the easiest way to

917
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,120
to have a security culture fail and an

918
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,799
organization fail you know what i mean

919
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,200
like

920
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,840
if you make it too hard uh it's a fine

921
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,240
line

922
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,840
you know like you want to make it where

923
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,039
it's secure but you want to make sure

924
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,799
that the users aren't going to as bryson

925
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,440
said find

926
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,919
find workarounds it's it's got there has

927
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,200
to be a nice like

928
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,000
there has to be a nice um balance there

929
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,720
and i think

930
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,519
on the flip side when we're educating

931
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,159
the

932
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,200
end users as as you were here they can

933
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,480
educate us too

934
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,840
right like what how what kind of

935
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,120
language should we be using to

936
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,320
communicate with them

937
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,039
and make it where it isn't this like

938
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,640
negative you clicked on a link you did

939
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,440
this

940
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
and it's more like okay so let me put

941
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,760
this in your terms okay let me explain

942
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,720
this to you

943
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
um i think that's hugely valuable you

944
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,600
know we can all learn from each other

945
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,840
exactly and there should be like you

946
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,799
know

947
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,199
my first thing would be and i'm not in

948
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,480
that engineering spot

949
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,960
like you said but if i was and i was

950
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,480
receiving that call i would be so

951
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,040
grateful

952
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,599
i would be like thank you it probably

953
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,199
took a lot of courage for you to call

954
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,199
and admit that this happened but

955
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,399
it's extremely valuable um

956
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,480
and so that that's something else i

957
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,839
think that we don't do enough because

958
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,800
you know having not only you know making

959
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,879
sure we're not fear-mongering but also

960
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,719
making sure we're showing gratitude when

961
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,079
people do do the things that they're

962
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,800
supposed to do

963
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,520
have you uh have you have you looked at

964
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,839
de-market all as a system solution

965
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,280
as far um i don't

966
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,359
again i'm more on the intelligent side

967
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
so i'm not so much on the

968
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,720
um on the

969
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
engineering side making the specific

970
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,560
security controls but

971
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,280
um i do think there is a lot of specific

972
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,000
controls

973
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,760
um in in my resources um specifically

974
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
the one that i used the most was the fbi

975
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
recently came out with in march there

976
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,079
was

977
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,119
a private industry notification for bec

978
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,560
and they had a lot of great

979
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,960
recommendations not only for general

980
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,000
uh public but also specifically for

981
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,079
uh system admins and people that are

982
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,720
making those specific

983
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
security controls to prevent this type

984
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:45,839
of attack

985
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,440
you
