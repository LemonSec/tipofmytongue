1
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,759
well

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,480
this is a little bit of a shortening of

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,920
one that i

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,520
originally gave at circle citycon i've

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,119
given it at several other

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,439
conferences and this was involved all

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,039
around how

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,000
the real reason that i believe that the

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,238
galactic empire failed was because of a

10
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,079
bad data governance issue

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,440
so who am i i'm micah k brown i'm an i.t

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
security engineer at a large financial

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,040
services organization

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,200
you can find all of my talks on my

please trish is absolutely correct my

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,640
slides are incredibly dense because i

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,120
want you

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,520
to be able to download share and use

joe yes i do

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,479
i'm uh the co-host of the threat hill

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,280
threat reel podcast with my good friend

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,360
matt as well as i've been volunteering

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
with the greater cincinnati issa chapter

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,799
for about 10 years 11 years now that

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,400
being said if you're ever in cincinnati

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
we have a lot of groups that are

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,960
designed to make your professional

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,720
and personal life just a little bit

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,040
easier we'd love to have you at any and

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,240
or all of our

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,439
events so while i agree

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,119
in star wars episode 4 luke skywalker

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,840
is absolutely heroic i do not think that

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,119
he is the hero

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,360
that allowed the rebel alliance to go

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,439
through and to escape the battle of

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,640
yavin

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,840
also chewbacca deserves a medal where's

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,720
my proof

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
it's right here in the opening crawl or

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,119
let me go through and zoom in on it a

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,360
little bit it clearly says

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,799
that the empire lost authority

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
over the death star plans now regardless

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,159
whether you are

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,040
subscribed to the legends canon of dark

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
forces

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,720
or whether you go through and you follow

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,360
the

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,560
newer rendition with jane erso

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
that's up to you but that being said

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,760
who is the hero

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,080
that allowed the rebel alliance to

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,599
survive

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
i think it's this guy a common everyday

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,599
i.t security practitioner or data

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,959
analyst that struggles to find a

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,400
work-life balance

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,239
he struggles to get the correct tools

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
resources visibility

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,840
to do their job and protect the global

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
empire his daily challenge separating

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,120
the signal from the

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,720
jam he is responsible for articulating

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,360
the bleeps the sweeps and the creeps and

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
he has some challenges going through and

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
communicating to imperial officers at

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,080
times

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,720
also michael winslow he deserves a medal

77
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
as well

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,680
so this got me asking myself what is

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
data government i'm not going to read

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,879
this slide to you but

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,120
what i wanted to show you was that four

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
very reputable

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
sources define data government just a

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,000
little bit differently

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
there's a lot that's the same but

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,319
there's a lot that's also different

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,720
so what can we say about data governance

88
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,360
well

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
obviously it means different things to

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,239
different people and that's cool that's

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:18,800
all right

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,760
it allows businesses to decide what data

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,400
governance

94
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,760
means for itself it also involves people

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,400
processes and technology maybe not just

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,599
in that order

97
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,159
it allows the business to make this or

98
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,440
strategic decisions

99
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,640
on how did a store process transmitted

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
and access within its environment it

101
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
should also help build up the

102
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,920
confidentiality

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,680
integrity and availability ensure

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,239
data governance is how we decide how to

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,200
decide

106
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,840
now i love nist one of the greatest

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,439
things that they do

108
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,319
is their little icons because it goes

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,720
through

110
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
and it conveys a really deep message in

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
a very simple

112
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,959
methodology so here we can see that data

113
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,840
governance

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,599
really is that 10 000 foot view

115
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,319
so i was actually creating this talk in

116
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,680
austin texas as i

117
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
was going and camping for an indycar

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,599
race down there

119
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,680
and i started to ask myself what does

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,839
data governance mean to me as an i.t

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,160
security practitioner as a blue teamer

122
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,400
so i proposed that there are several

123
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
rules laws

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,600
regulation contractual agreements that

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
affect the organization i work for

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,560
and that caused certain state actors in

127
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
my case

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,199
it could be business management i t

129
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,800
security legal

130
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
maybe have a risk management team to go

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,160
through and say hey

132
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,639
we need to have a data governance

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,600
program

134
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
which focuses on the ownership the

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,280
accessibility

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,639
the security the integrity the and the

137
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,440
knowledge of

138
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
how we use data and where it is stored

139
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
in our organization

140
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,320
these are then expressed in various

141
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,880
policies procedures processes

142
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,600
and ultimately i would hope that we can

143
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,160
go through

144
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
and use some sort of active controls or

145
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
as i called it an actual data governance

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,600
tools

147
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,720
or technologies to enforce policies

148
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,320
in our environment so

149
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,800
if we aren't required by any rural law

150
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,039
regulation contracts or agreement

151
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,840
to have a data governance program why do

152
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,080
we

153
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
need to go through and invest the time

154
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,360
to invest the money to

155
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
miss the resources well in my

156
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,080
personal view i find that

157
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
with a mature data governance program we

158
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,520
can enable

159
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
better decision making we can reduce

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
operational traffic

161
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
friction we can go through and we can

162
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,080
adopt

163
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,639
common sense approaches to our data

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,160
issues we can build standard and

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,759
repeatable processes

166
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,080
and let me tell you that is absolutely

167
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
huge to have

168
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,960
certain building blocks of your

169
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
environment that just have security to

170
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
have data governance that have privacy

171
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,319
built in from the seed

172
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,800
is awesome it can go through and reduce

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
the cost and

174
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
increase effectiveness of all of our

175
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,039
other controls

176
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,479
and for me i'm a big big believer in

177
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,000
transparency

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,319
we are allies of the business we are

179
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,919
defenders of the business

180
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,240
we need to be sure that we are open

181
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,199
transparent

182
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,520
and that we have earned our peers trust

183
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
so i came up with the tool actionable

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
data governance tool there's probably a

185
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,280
better tool out there but this was what

186
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,880
i came up with at the time

187
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,199
so this is a control that allows us to

188
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,080
go through

189
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,120
and to apply some sort of

190
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
policy that is an alignment to our data

191
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
governance program so this can be like a

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,720
permit

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,639
a permit with a special encryption like

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,240
requiring a dig

195
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
excuse me digital signature or requiring

196
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,440
the file to be encrypted in transit

197
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,400
it could be permit with the

198
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
justification where we ask the user hey

199
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,759
we're seeing this lab behavior

200
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,599
can you help us understand what is going

201
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,680
on here we can permit with an alert

202
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,599
we can deny with an alert or we could

203
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,199
deny it without an alert

204
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,880
you might have other options in your

205
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
environment

206
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
so of course when we're talking about

207
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,759
data governance

208
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,479
there's of course the triforce of store

209
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,039
process

210
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
and transmit i think there's a fourth a

211
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,160
hidden triforce

212
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,280
and that's identity and access and

213
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,560
i say that because primarily most of the

214
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,840
data governance

215
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,880
tools that i use on a day-to-day basis

216
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,120
go through and make the fundamental

217
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,880
assumption not that it's right

218
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
not that it's wrong it's just what they

219
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
do that the user

220
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
that the entity that the process that

221
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,199
is making a request

222
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,639
of a system is actually that system

223
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,280
and as we can talk with any of our peers

224
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,759
that are

225
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,240
more on the red or purple team they've

226
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,520
gotten pretty good

227
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,800
at asserting and taking over other

228
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,280
entities be the users be they become

229
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,879
computer assets so in my mind this

230
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,160
identity and access is

231
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,319
absolutely a huge fundamental part of

232
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,360
any data governance program

233
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,039
now in spending four years of my life

234
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
standing up a global data loss

235
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
prevention

236
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,919
environment i came up with this

237
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
saying that i used often is that there

238
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
is no false positives

239
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
there's only poorly written rules and it

240
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
got to be a meme within my organization

241
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,800
but it became very effective and

242
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,360
why i say that is at the beginning of

243
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,320
our process

244
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
we were just throwing out oh that was a

245
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
false positive oh

246
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
that alert was a false positive and what

247
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,240
were we saying when we said that's a

248
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,799
false

249
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,799
positives we're saying that we got an

250
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,000
alert from our system

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,440
that we went in we did our research

252
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
we evaluated things and at the end of

253
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,120
the day

254
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,040
we believe that alert was in air

255
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,480
that we wasted our time and so

256
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,760
as we saw the system turning out 30 40

257
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
50 percent false positives what were we

258
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,040
telling ourselves what were we

259
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,560
communicating to our managers we're

260
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,040
saying

261
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,360
hey this tool stinks so instead of that

262
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,800
i challenged my team let's take a look

263
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,080
at our alerts on validity versus ax

264
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,640
accuracy so validity did we get the

265
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
desired result

266
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,720
so what i would do is i'd strip out

267
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
human emotion

268
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,519
i'd look at the input i'd look at the

269
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,800
rule and

270
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,120
i have to say almost every time i did

271
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
that

272
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,720
i agreed that we were getting valid

273
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,279
alerts

274
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,839
out of the system based on both what was

275
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,880
coming into the system

276
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,560
and the rules and that was

277
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,760
really interesting to me but the

278
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
accuracy did we detect on what we think

279
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,959
we should have

280
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
that was a bit down so by changing to

281
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
viewing things through accuracy versus

282
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,000
validity

283
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,320
we are actually able to go through and

284
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,040
to start to communicate

285
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,399
hey we need to work on tuning our system

286
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,640
we need to work on our definitions

287
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
and i think that was an incredible

288
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,760
breakthrough for me

289
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,519
actually going through and modernizing

290
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,320
our concept of what dlp data loss

291
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
prevention data governance tools

292
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,680
could be so

293
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,959
i wanted to come up with a framework so

294
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
within my volunteering with the greater

295
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
cincinnati issa

296
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,240
we do have certain members that are

297
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,600
definitely the executive management

298
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,079
level

299
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
but we have a lot of people that are you

300
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
know at the small to medium business we

301
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,720
have people

302
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
that are entrepreneurs that are doing

303
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
the whole i.t stack themselves

304
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,399
and we had i.t practitioners that now

305
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,760
had security

306
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,600
formally thrown on their shoulders so i

307
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
wanted to have something

308
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,040
of simple framework that i could point

309
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
them to and i could say

310
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
here's how i would bulk things into

311
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,079
first

312
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,279
second and third order event easy

313
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,760
medium and oh my gosh this is going to

314
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
be a challenge

315
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
so i absolutely love the cis top 20

316
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,440
controls

317
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,800
and so i built off of that simple

318
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,360
framework

319
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
the reason why i love the cis top 20

320
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,880
controls is because

321
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,399
of a single printout one page

322
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
i can hand it to someone anyone within

323
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
my organization

324
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,040
and i can have a real detailed talk

325
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,600
about

326
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
what we are doing why we're doing it and

327
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,040
where we are going

328
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,079
in the future so you can see

329
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,560
these uh nine different controls that i

330
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,600
created for

331
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
the framework that i've leveraged

332
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,440
extensively within my greater cincinnati

333
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
area

334
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,920
and this is i know there's a lot going

335
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,480
on here

336
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,720
so what i'm trying to do is compare and

337
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
contrast and depending on the specific

338
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,320
spot product you pick

339
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
it might have more or less functionality

340
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
but at the top in the green what i'm

341
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,880
trying to

342
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
express is you as the i.t security

343
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,959
practitioner

344
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,160
how much authority do you have over

345
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
those systems

346
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,480
then the gray boxes those are the actual

347
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
types of formal

348
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,639
assets whereas the blue bars are those

349
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,120
nine

350
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,880
data governance controls that i

351
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,120
reference and then the stop sign

352
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,360
indicates that it can block the uh

353
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,720
triangle arrow

354
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
is an alert and the green circle is that

355
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
it can generally

356
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
enforce policy and once again i know i'm

357
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
giving you a ton of information here

358
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,959
there's even more in the full version

359
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
that's on my github

360
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,519
but let's go through and do a mini deep

361
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,000
dive on three of these

362
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,600
so let's start talking about the basic

363
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,560
controls and for the first basic control

364
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,279
i wanted to circle in on file and disk

365
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,079
encryption

366
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,600
and key management of course whenever

367
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
we're dealing with encryption

368
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
it's only as strong as we're protecting

369
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
those keys so we need to make sure that

370
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
we are protecting them

371
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
correctly working for an international

372
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,680
organization

373
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,240
i have to be very careful when i am

374
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
deploying cryptography

375
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
i do not violate any rules laws

376
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,839
regulations

377
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,560
please talk to your friendly lawyers

378
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,600
that being said

379
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,519
when you go through and you implement

380
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,079
advanced encryption such as fips 140

381
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,519
depending on your tool you might lose

382
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,240
some functionality so make sure to talk

383
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
to your friendly vendors

384
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
and to fully understand what any

385
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
implications of turning on

386
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,880
that higher level of cryptography is so

387
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,760
that you can

388
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,639
go through and go into it with eyes wide

389
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,839
open

390
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,120
now it's become very popular to go

391
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,600
through

392
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,839
and to encrypt portable media and

393
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,120
generally there's two ways that you can

394
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,480
do it you can either encrypt the whole

395
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
piece of portable media

396
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,920
or you can just encrypt the files

397
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,839
written from your managed system

398
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
onto that piece of portable media i

399
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,279
prefer the latter

400
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,399
the file level of encryption but there's

401
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,519
good points

402
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,279
or good points why you might choose the

403
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,639
full disk encryption

404
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,839
either way we need to be very careful

405
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,279
i have a friend who works in a similar

406
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,279
industry within cincinnati

407
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,320
and they were working on rolling out

408
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,639
portable media encryption and they have

409
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,320
a lot of

410
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,880
how should i say drivers that go out and

411
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,000
help people with

412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,800
insurance policies and those drivers

413
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
were actually leveraging

414
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,760
legacy gps systems and

415
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,959
what was not caught in time

416
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,600
is that when people went through and

417
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,000
plugged

418
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,839
their gps systems into their corporate

419
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,680
laptops in order to go through and

420
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,440
update the maps

421
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
the actual file disk

422
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
or the full disk encryption that they

423
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,079
were doing was

424
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,560
encrypting the entire gps breaking them

425
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,360
luckily

426
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,839
uh the mistake was caught pretty early

427
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,480
so the

428
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,600
damage was less but we need to make sure

429
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
that we are open and transparent about

430
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,279
what we are doing with our users

431
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,040
because you do not want to be the person

432
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
that accidentally encrypted

433
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,959
you know a family's thumb drive that was

434
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,120
full of personal pictures

435
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,040
that being said we also need to go

436
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,199
through and to be extremely careful not

437
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,079
to brick devices that we do not own

438
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
and finally in the terms of file and

439
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,000
disk encryption

440
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,560
you know we need to be careful of when

441
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,680
we encrypt

442
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
files on network shares we need to

443
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,399
understand how key management works

444
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
you know this is where i think apple

445
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,320
google and microsoft they've done a lot

446
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,880
of good

447
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,519
in our community over the past 10 years

448
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,160
in making

449
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,399
encryption that's something approachable

450
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,680
for every person

451
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
on their new devices but we need to make

452
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,720
sure

453
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,560
that we are going through and

454
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
implementing it with honor

455
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,399
and that we're doing it in an open and

456
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
transparent way

457
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,720
so now let's move on to the foundational

458
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,160
controls

459
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,880
so for this i picked data classification

460
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,519
and the reason

461
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
why i picked this is because an

462
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
effective data classification strategy

463
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,639
is absolutely needed for you to move

464
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,440
further

465
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,079
along your trail so when it comes to

466
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,600
data classification there are generally

467
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,720
two strategies

468
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,160
and it's not that one works better than

469
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,920
the other i think they work better

470
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,560
together

471
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,959
and i think they break in different ways

472
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,959
so traditional data classification is

473
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,639
based on a series

474
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,959
of data objects via text text

475
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,320
dictionaries regular expression

476
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
dictionaries

477
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,160
pattern matching and boolean logic now

478
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,800
this can

479
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,920
serve a couple different challenges so

480
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,120
many dlp type engines have different

481
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
versions of red jacks have different

482
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,040
functionalities so that might make it

483
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,759
hard

484
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,519
difficult or you might not be able to

485
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,519
carry over a classification one-for-one

486
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,000
between multiple systems

487
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
another problem with it is

488
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,240
that these

489
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,880
it's very easy to get around these type

490
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,959
of data classifications uh

491
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,440
with a just the most minor bit of

492
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,480
obfuscation

493
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,759
and we'll touch on that in a bit i'll

494
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,000
show you some really cool things

495
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,560
secondly we can do meta tag data so

496
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,680
within

497
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,559
many popular office type suite there is

498
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,720
a way that you can empower your users

499
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,199
to go through and apply an internal data

500
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,079
classification

501
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
into the header or the meta tag area of

502
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,520
every file now this is

503
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,839
awesome because it does a couple quick

504
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,359
things first off

505
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,160
these types of scans on files are super

506
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,439
lightweight

507
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,000
the second thing is every time we ask a

508
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
user to go through and to classify an

509
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,720
item for us

510
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
a couple magical things happen first

511
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,840
we're telling our users

512
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,720
hey we as an organization we value our

513
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,679
data we want to be

514
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,240
good data stewards and then generally

515
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,520
when you implement these

516
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,760
you can either hover over or you or

517
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,120
there's a little like three sentence

518
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,080
description

519
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
that can help guide the user to go

520
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,080
through and to select the correct data

521
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,520
classification

522
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,679
now this is great we're training we're

523
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,919
bringing our users in

524
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,600
actively inviting them to be part of our

525
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,880
data stewardship

526
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,080
however if i'm a bad guy if i'm a

527
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,200
malicious actor

528
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
no i'm just gonna lie and i'm going to

529
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,960
get through it so this is where

530
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,320
i think that using both together is very

531
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,160
powerful so let's talk about a couple

532
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
different challenges with data

533
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,679
classifications the first

534
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,440
we have we currently have at the time of

535
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,280
this recording 50 states

536
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,120
and each state is allowed to create

537
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,880
their driver's license

538
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
in any way shape or form that they want

539
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,840
so in my driver's license

540
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,200
regex i have 26 positive

541
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,640
matches and i'm going to show those to

542
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,840
you secondly many websites use a 15

543
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,280
16 digit code or numeric code to

544
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,640
reference contact

545
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,440
what does that look like it looks like a

546
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,000
credit card

547
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,960
number obviously regular expressions and

548
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
word dictionaries

549
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
are not optimal and we need to do better

550
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,720
and a couple of ways where i've

551
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
really upped my game in writing data

552
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,080
classification especially using

553
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,760
traditional data classification

554
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,960
is to follow the primary rule of improv

555
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,400
and always combine sentences with yes

556
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,679
and that has led me to go through and to

557
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,280
significantly

558
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,640
reduce the sub

559
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,919
optimal detections likewise we can use

560
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,440
proximity rules that's where we're

561
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
looking for condition a

562
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
and condition b within so many

563
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,160
characters of

564
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,760
each other so on the left you're going

565
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,720
to see

566
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,679
my driver's license match now this is

567
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,640
great and all

568
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
but we were matching on things that we

569
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,919
really shouldn't have been matching on

570
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,799
we are matching on

571
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,400
our user ids our admin ids simple year

572
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,320
year year day or month

573
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,280
month day day or day day month month

574
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,919
year year

575
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,640
year year date stamps we are matching on

576
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,120
change

577
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,080
tickets problem tickets incident tickets

578
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,640
uh

579
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,039
service desk tickets so we had to go

580
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,400
through and

581
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,679
reject all of the actual

582
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,160
regular expressions that are in that

583
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,880
grayed out box on the right

584
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,760
so let's move on to the organizational

585
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,880
controls

586
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,240
so data loss prevention to me data loss

587
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,960
prevention

588
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,039
is actually a combination of multiple

589
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,080
different tools

590
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,200
that work together to go through

591
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,720
and to apply actual data governance

592
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,760
rules

593
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,679
in within your environment so we've got

594
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,440
things like the dlp client so this sits

595
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,559
on your laptop

596
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,520
and applies policy to how your users are

597
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,120
interacting with your laptop

598
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,159
dlnp network is kind of like ibs ips it

599
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,320
scans a specific network traffic

600
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,760
a network port and it makes permit deny

601
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,039
decisions there

602
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,159
a dlp repository scanner is a system

603
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,559
that'll scan your unstructured data so

604
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,240
it could be shares it could be databases

605
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,679
it could be your nas it could be your

606
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,039
sand

607
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,760
and it'll go through and it will report

608
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,480
back

609
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,400
to where it thinks there's potentially

610
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
sensitive information

611
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,360
within your environment you've got dlp

612
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,480
email dlp web so respectively

613
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,559
i like to scan both incoming and

614
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,039
outgoing i like to scan incoming

615
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,320
because i want to be very open and

616
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,559
transparent with my users and advice

617
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,320
even though i can't be a good data

618
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,640
steward until i receive a piece of

619
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,520
information

620
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,760
if i see information coming in as a

621
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,880
sub-optimal way

622
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
i'd like to be the one to bring that to

623
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,000
the attention

624
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,080
of whoever's collecting that data and

625
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,760
say hey i think i've got a better way

626
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,880
for us to do that

627
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,080
and finally and this is this is probably

628
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,240
the most challenging part in my opinion

629
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,159
the dlp management console so this is

630
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,400
the central piece of software

631
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
that orchestrates your dlp environment

632
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
and if you think about it

633
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,679
dlp is set to catch our most sensitive

634
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,440
information and so what we want to do is

635
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,200
when we do get an alert we generally

636
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
attach the primary file

637
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,400
and we probably attach a bit or all

638
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,480
of what flagged it and we also capture

639
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,440
the basic who

640
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
where when why but if i've got my

641
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,480
offensive hat on

642
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,000
and i take a look at the services that

643
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
are running ico there's a dop

644
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,919
agent you better believe that i want to

645
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,840
go through and get access to that dlp

646
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
console by hook or by crook

647
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,360
because i want to see those incidents

648
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,039
because if i find a file that has

649
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,039
potentially sensitive information

650
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,400
in a specific repository chances are i'm

651
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,679
going to find other sensitive

652
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,799
information

653
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,400
in that environment so i know we're

654
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
coming up on time here

655
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
and i want to be respectful to

656
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,440
everyone's time

657
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,679
so if you would like to reach out i'd

658
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,520
love to continue this conversation here

659
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,799
there anywhere if you

660
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,400
do run any type of i.t security group

661
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,480
and you see a talk that i would like or

662
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,919
that you'd like me to present

663
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,679
please feel free to reach out i'd love

664
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,919
to do that i want to thank everyone at

665
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,120
scythe and grim

666
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,280
that have helped put this on you have

667
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
immensely helped me over the past 18

668
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,840
months

669
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
so thank you for this edutainment thank

670
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,520
you in any questions

671
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
zero trust right zero trust architecture

672
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,760
is is now all the rage and since it was

673
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,640
uh

674
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
it has been mandated to the federal

675
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
government through the by the executive

676
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,960
order

677
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,880
um and to me what makes zero trust so

678
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,240
hard is

679
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,400
the data right it's easy to just be like

680
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
well we're going to just have this but

681
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,919
actually having the data to do that so

682
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,200
what advice would you

683
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,880
would you give the federal government

684
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,039
who is in the position it has right like

685
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,360
system sprawl software sprawl data

686
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,240
sprawl

687
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,520
largest system in the world what do they

688
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,559
do micah

689
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,880
so right now that is something that is

690
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,760
very pertinent

691
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,880
to my professional job and where i where

692
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,559
we're really going through

693
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
and we're focusing a lot of our efforts

694
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,559
and it's harder than you can possibly

695
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,520
believe

696
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,400
it's what i call intimacy or into me i

697
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,120
see

698
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
you need to understand how your

699
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
organization

700
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
works you need to understand your data

701
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,919
flows uh

702
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,159
in terms of network segmentation you

703
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
know that's only a part of it

704
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
you also have to understand how are you

705
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,080
going to go through and quantify

706
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,640
all of your identities and what

707
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
identities do

708
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
are you actually running so you know

709
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,679
we've got users we probably

710
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,240
have admins we probably have help desks

711
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,360
we probably have

712
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,480
service accounts in that non-human

713
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
accounts that interact with computer to

714
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,919
computer communication

715
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,600
getting an inventory of all that and

716
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
then creating your use cases

717
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,840
and this is where i struggle the most is

718
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,799
defining the actual identity

719
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,919
plus the type of connection plus the uh

720
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,919
frequency or the normalness of the

721
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,520
connection into

722
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,559
an actual like low medium high in

723
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,520
defining

724
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,559
what we do at each one of those how

725
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,440
should i say

726
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,000
checkpoints

727
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,279
to sum it up i'm glad i don't have that

728
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,520
job

729
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,720
nice love guru reference by the way

730
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,080
micah

731
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,320
hey i'm glad you got that of course uh

732
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,039
what about what about multi-cloud

733
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,279
so that's something that we're also

734
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,520
going through and

735
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,720
for multi-cloud you i really focus on

736
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
where am i putting my policy

737
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
engines am i forcing everything through

738
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,360
a centralized i.t security cloud

739
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,720
or and and have it all be unified there

740
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,320
or do i have embed multiple instances of

741
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
those protection engines within

742
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,799
each cloud environment and once again

743
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,640
this is going to come back to your own

744
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
risk tolerance your own policies and

745
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
procedures

746
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,400
but i'm a big i'm becoming more and more

747
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,679
of a big fan

748
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,679
of a unified security hub

749
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,320
a unified security hub correct me like a

750
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,879
death star

751
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,240
um

752
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,120
not quite a death star a protection star

753
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,840
it's it's one of those things where if

754
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,720
you

755
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
think about one of the talks i gave was

756
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,840
on web

757
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,720
application firewalls and so if you

758
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,200
could

759
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,000
embed within whatever your security

760
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,559
cloud

761
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,600
is that all traffic passing

762
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
from your trusted environment or

763
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,799
environment

764
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,799
going out to the internet or anything

765
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,000
coming from

766
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,840
any external coming into your

767
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
environment has to go through

768
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,320
you know a unified security fabric that

769
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,880
has

770
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,279
you know a combination of all of your

771
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,200
web application firewalls your dynamic

772
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,159
firewalls

773
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,360
uh your ips's your ids's your dlp

774
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,640
uh your casb your sassy whatever

775
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
controls that you have implemented and

776
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,400
having that at the

777
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,000
cloud edge especially for cloud

778
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,559
resources that's kind of

779
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,559
where my mind is right now

780
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
all right since we're discussing star

781
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
wars who shot first

782
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,720
of course han shop first con shop first

783
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,120
come on

784
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,760
does anybody actually believe otherwise

785
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,600
like this is a serious question

786
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,799
kyle katarn believes

787
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,679
well i mean just honestly like whoever

788
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,440
shot first would win that fight at that

789
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,200
range

790
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
it depends first and missed

791
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,840
it depends on the setting but we know

792
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,200
the setting we they were there

793
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,960
in most nicely they're like right across

794
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,399
from the table he has the gun pulled on

795
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:34,880
him

796
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,480
if he had shot first he would have shot

797
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,039
hot i mean i i don't think even

798
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,960
with storm trooper accuracy he could

799
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,360
have missed

800
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,840
i think there's wisdom in that

801
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,520
i loved the uh point about chewie

802
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,960
needing a medal

803
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
that's true well you see you see i fixed

804
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,279
it there

805
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,720
love it love it that's so funny

806
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,480
nice little bonus hold on i gotta get a

807
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,320
picture of that yep that's good

808
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,120
so thank you very much for this

809
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,440
opportunity i've really enjoyed it

810
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,399
and please feel free to uh to anyone

811
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,640
listening or watching please feel free

812
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,760
i'd love to continue this conversation

813
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,960
are you on the discord in the expert um

814
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,960
channel yes i am okay um

815
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
make sure that you are tagged as a

816
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,799
speaker if you are not already

817
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,799
you are not let's get that no yeah you

818
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,559
are good

819
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,080
all right so for those of you want to

820
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
ask more questions uh because mike

821
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,120
clearly has a lot more he could have

822
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,240
presented

823
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,480
uh and trisha you were right that was a

824
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,360
very text

825
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,760
dense slideshow it it led with the

826
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,600
powerful graphics and then it went right

827
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
into the hardcore text

828
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,279
you you should see my web application

829
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,200
firewall one it would make

830
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,799
trisha's uh brain break i did see it

831
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,159
i did see it and um yeah it's it was so

832
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:02,559
funny

833
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
because when we were doing our talk

834
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,960
together um it was something that we

835
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,919
discussed

836
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,880
multiple times and the you know the

837
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,000
final consensus which

838
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,240
i do really agree and respect actually a

839
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
lot about micah is that all of his talks

840
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
really aren't intended to

841
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
to teach and learn and having that

842
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
github repository in the event that you

843
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,559
couldn't

844
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,880
see the talk itself like this the

845
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,000
powerpoint does stand

846
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,039
on its own which is cool um

847
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,159
for sure as a marketer you know it just

848
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,360
kills me inside a little

849
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:41,840
not a big deal only a little though

850
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,760
any final thoughts micah for the

851
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,240
audience uh you know what

852
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,320
i anyone that is interested in

853
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,720
