1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,799
so my presentation today is going to be

2
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,760
on rebuilding trust after a cyber or

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,359
disinformation attack

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,600
um so as waden rule said my name is

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,279
davey nair i'm from the center for

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,359
strategic and international studies

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,960
specifically i'm with the defending

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,279
democratic institutions team and what we

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,480
do is we look at how

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,200
cyber and cyber enabled disinformation

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,600
operations undermine trust in democratic

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,640
institutions

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,120
so we have a very strong focus on the

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,719
justice system

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,320
and and the courts in the united states

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,079
and we work with them to kind of develop

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,039
counter measures to to go and address

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,719
these different cyber and disinformation

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,160
attacks but we also do

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,079
study some of the other democratic

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,440
institutions as well

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,000
um including media elections national

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,360
security institutions

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,760
and of course private sector companies

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,640
in the um

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,239
in our democracy and so our ddi team

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,040
uh is led by suzanne spaulding she was

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
the former dhs under secretary for the

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,439
national protection programs directorate

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,159
which is now

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,920
the cyber security and infrastructure

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,240
security agency at dhs

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
um and we work in close collaboration

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,840
with the american bar association

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
standing committee on law and national

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,560
security

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,799
um and so between suzanne and the

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
national security experts and the aba

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,080
folks that we have

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,159
on this team really what we're trying to

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,040
do is uh study but then also kind of

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
develop these countermeasures to help us

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,640
deter and detect

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,119
and mitigate any fallout from any sort

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,840
of cyber incident

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,799
so just a very quick overview into what

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,240
i'm talking about today

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,960
um as you can see this is just a image

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,479
from one of our

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,479
pieces that we put out in csis looking

51
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,240
at how to restore trust in national

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,399
security institutions as a whole

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,880
um why it's important to kind of rebuild

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,680
trust

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
and how you can actually go about doing

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,799
that and so

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,119
in the context of this speech i think

58
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,640
it's just important to kind of at the

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,360
outset say

60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,038
you know why it's important to be

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,120
talking about rebuilding trust

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
um i think you know one of the main

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,280
things is is security and really cyber

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,120
security specifically

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,160
um it's gonna rely on trust um

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,280
whether it's the constant uh

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040
information sharing and communication

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
that we're talking about between the

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,599
public sector

70
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,840
and private entities and the larger

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,959
american public

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,800
to any sort of efforts that are trying

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
to get people to engage with companies

74
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,680
or

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
or larger institutions after a cyber

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,200
incident um

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
really it's going to rely on having that

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
kind of trust to

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
move beyond any sort of activity once

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,319
it's once something bad has happened in

81
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,519
the cyber realm

82
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
um and so you know one thing that we're

83
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
really concerned about and i think this

84
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,200
group can probably appreciate it

85
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,360
more than more than others is it is

86
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
extremely frustrating sometimes when you

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,239
talk about

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,560
uh cyber security and larger security

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,720
conversation as an afterthought or as

90
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,599
kind of a separate siloed conversation

91
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,680
but really that consideration can kind

92
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
of cut the other way as well

93
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,040
when you're talking about a cyber

94
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,800
incident um or some sort of cyber attack

95
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
sometimes the immediate inclination is

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
to try to go and see what is the

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
immediate cyber fix what are the

98
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,120
technical vulnerabilities that we need

99
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,159
to worry about

100
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,640
without giving as much attention to what

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,519
are the larger

102
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,840
considerations of of trust of that

103
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
institution that we need to be thinking

104
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,799
about what are the things that are

105
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
compromised beyond just that immediate

106
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,080
uh system whether it's the actual

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,920
processes themselves or even trust in

108
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,720
the actual

109
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
um ways that the institution is

110
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,840
operating

111
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,159
that kind of need to be addressed and so

112
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,599
that's that's kind of what we're getting

113
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,239
at with this

114
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,000
uh presentation and some of the work

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
that we do at csis

116
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,879
um and so you know what this

117
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,799
presentation again is going to focus on

118
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,280
is

119
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
pulling from our work with the justice

120
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,040
system so i'll use that as some of the

121
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,000
examples

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,239
um i'll talk through about some of the

123
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,760
things we're doing with the courts with

124
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,599
the judges to rebuild trust in those

125
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,799
institutions

126
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,720
but i really do want to emphasize that

127
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,799
the takeaways and the lessons

128
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,640
um for how the courts and the justice

129
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,478
system rebuild after

130
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,918
different types of cyber attacks are

131
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,880
really applicable to other institutions

132
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
and other companies as well so just

133
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
wanted to kind of say that out the

134
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,880
outside

135
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,720
um so in terms of just the recent

136
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
attacks uh

137
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,680
i just put a few of them up there and

138
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
unfortunately there's a lot that that i

139
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,759
can

140
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,000
pick from there um there's obviously

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,840
just a lot that we still don't know

142
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,000
so a lot of the initial investigations

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,120
are gonna rightfully

144
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
focus on what were the technical

145
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,400
vulnerabilities that need to be

146
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,759
addressed or what were some of the

147
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
reporting processes

148
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
that need to be changed to make sure

149
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,280
that this kind of attack

150
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
doesn't happen again in the future but

151
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
obviously there's still so much that we

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,720
don't know

153
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,800
so for any of the types of recent cyber

154
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,639
attacks um there's always that concern

155
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,080
about what is the real

156
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
the full extent of the information that

157
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
was accessed

158
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,000
um especially sensitive information that

159
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
was definitely a huge thing of concern

160
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
for the courts with the solarwinds

161
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,720
breach

162
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
um of course there's the the issue of

163
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
what is the full scope of the attack so

164
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
it's really hard to just say oh this

165
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
attack was just for mere espionage or

166
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,000
this was

167
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,520
merely just a ransomware attack that's

168
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
that's bad enough as is but

169
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,520
um you know whether it's the issue of

170
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
latent malware or any other sort of

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,440
uh you know undetected part of a cyber

172
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
intrusion that we're just not aware of

173
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
um that's always kind of going to be in

174
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
the back of the mind and things that we

175
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,919
either won't know now or won't ever know

176
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,639
really

177
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,240
um and then that kind of leads to the

178
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,160
third thing which really gets at why we

179
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,840
need to talk about rebuilding trust and

180
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
that is the idea of the purpose of an

181
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,400
attack

182
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,960
um it's really really hard to discern

183
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,240
what the purpose is and

184
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,039
oftentimes a cyber attack even a hard

185
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,000
cyber attack

186
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
um can play a role in a larger

187
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
information operation

188
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
so when we talk about information

189
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
operations the mind immediately goes to

190
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
something like social media

191
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
regular you know routine disinformation

192
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
operations which is a very very big part

193
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,840
of it

194
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
but we also have to remember that these

195
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,759
kind of hard cyber attacks

196
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,560
also intentionally or unintentionally

197
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,520
play a role

198
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,080
in larger information operations because

199
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
it gets people to start asking questions

200
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,639
about

201
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,639
how do we trust our institutions to

202
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,400
protect our information or to

203
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,360
keep us safe what does this do and

204
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
impact the trust between

205
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,160
private sector and the american public

206
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
or private sector and the government and

207
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,759
again those levels of trust need to be

208
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,280
very high especially when you're talking

209
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
about any sort of response

210
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
coming out of a cyber incident

211
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,000
and so with those kind of concerns in

212
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,720
mind

213
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
um there's two kind of initial big

214
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
takeaways that i want to highlight one

215
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,280
is just

216
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
like i said cyber attacks can be part of

217
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
a larger information operation

218
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,000
um so not forgetting that part and not

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,520
forgetting the larger scope of what an

220
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,880
attack could actually mean or the

221
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
consequences of it

222
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
is an important mindset to kind of get

223
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
into when you're thinking about how to

224
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,160
properly build out cyber preparedness

225
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,639
plans or any sort of recovery plan after

226
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,360
an attack um and the second takeaway is

227
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,759
that

228
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,440
again these plans need to be so

229
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
comprehensive that they're looking

230
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,479
beyond the technical solutions

231
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,080
so when we're thinking about growing

232
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
institutional resilience

233
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,880
what are the other things the

234
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
institution needs to do to

235
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
not only make sure that they're a less

236
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,319
attractive target for future attacks but

237
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,880
that

238
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,520
they're actually able to um withstand in

239
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,039
a in a very um

240
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,240
in a way that's i guess able to to get

241
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,599
the trust of the public how are they

242
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,800
able to grow

243
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,199
uh from any sort of incident that um

244
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
that faces their institution and so just

245
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,280
again

246
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
like i said i'm going to focus on the

247
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,120
justice system the the doj

248
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
the federal courts the state courts um

249
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,400
have all

250
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,160
they they were obviously worried and

251
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,599
kind of on high alert about

252
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,199
various disinformation attacks

253
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
especially in the run-up to the election

254
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,440
that's

255
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,199
a lot of the context in which we worked

256
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,879
with the state courts in particular and

257
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,280
i'll get into that in a bit

258
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,039
but um just wanted to highlight again

259
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,800
that like even something the solar winds

260
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,360
hack

261
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,400
uh where the doj was breached and also

262
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
a lot of the uh the federal courts are

263
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
worried because their electronic filing

264
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
and case systems

265
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
uh were breached in that larger attack

266
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,080
as well so a lot of things i'm going to

267
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,680
go over in terms of what their

268
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
appropriate response was

269
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,120
is the things even though they were

270
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,399
talking more in the context of

271
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,919
pre-election there's still kind of

272
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,279
things that the courts are working

273
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,320
through

274
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,800
currently

275
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,320
so a few kind of points that i wanted to

276
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
make before i get into some of the

277
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,800
examples that we're looking at

278
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
is really just a few caveats about uh

279
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,920
you know who are the attacks who are the

280
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,839
attackers who are the adversaries and

281
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,200
what are the types of attacks that we're

282
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,320
concerned about

283
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
so i'm going to be specifically talking

284
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
about um

285
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,240
instances of russian disinformation

286
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
operations against the court

287
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,399
but in truth it's obviously not just

288
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,920
russia there's a lot of other countries

289
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,760
that are engaged in disinformation and

290
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,959
cyber activities

291
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,880
um and it's not just foreign adversaries

292
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,640
there are a lot of domestic voices as

293
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,440
well that are

294
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
that are unfortunately contributing to

295
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,080
the cyber and disinformation

296
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
that's going after some of our

297
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
institutions

298
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
um the second thing is disinformation

299
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,080
operations and cyber attacks really do

300
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,160
exploit weaknesses and vulnerabilities

301
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
of our own making

302
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
um so what i mean by that is you know

303
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,519
whether it's the divisive discourse

304
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,080
or even just our institutions not living

305
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,800
up to

306
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,839
to our expectations those are things

307
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,240
that

308
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
traditionally make disinformation um sit

309
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
well and kind of easily spread those are

310
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,959
things that bad actors are

311
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,560
are looking at that they're looking to

312
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,519
target um it's very easy to kind of jump

313
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,600
on those societal vulnerabilities

314
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,320
and start seeding uh you know

315
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,440
disinformation

316
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,079
amplifying manipulating information um

317
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
so to the extent that we can kind of

318
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,440
uh you know take away opportunities for

319
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
bad actors to spread that kind of

320
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
disinformation by

321
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
addressing some of those weaknesses and

322
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
vulnerabilities of our own making

323
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,240
um that is that is a huge step in the

324
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,120
process

325
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,279
um and the last thing is there is this

326
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,320
balance between

327
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,839
people that are critical of our

328
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,440
institutions versus

329
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,000
actual disinformation or cyber attacks

330
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440
that are intended to weaken

331
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,839
our institutions so you know when we're

332
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,360
talking about rebuilding trust we're not

333
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,200
saying or going after anything that's

334
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,880
just critical of our institutions

335
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,839
because

336
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,279
that actually is important for our

337
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,600
democracy we need people to

338
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,120
constantly be looking to improve our

339
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
democracy constantly critiquing our

340
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,480
institutions to make sure that they're

341
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,279
better

342
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,200
um but that's not really what we're

343
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
seeing with the disinformation that

344
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,320
we're seeing from a lot of bad actors

345
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,240
that are looking to actually say

346
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
not only are your institutions not great

347
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,279
and they're not working but they're

348
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,800
irrevocably broken

349
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,519
um there's no way of redeeming these

350
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,120
institutions and fixing them for the

351
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,760
better

352
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
and so i'll give some examples of that

353
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,680
but that's really the kind of

354
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
disinformation that we're worried about

355
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,519
and the type that we need to kind of

356
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,240
build plans around to make sure that

357
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,720
we're

358
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
we're properly rebuilding trust after

359
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,079
any sort of major incident

360
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
so like i said there's kind of these

361
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,920
harder cyber threats to the courts that

362
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,440
you're worried about so the hacking and

363
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,040
leaking of sensitive court documents

364
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
altering data protecting

365
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
any sort of sensitive information and

366
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,399
it's really easy to see how

367
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
any of these could actually be used

368
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
in combination with or as a separate

369
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
standalone disinformation operation or

370
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,480
as part of a larger information

371
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,600
operation

372
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,320
and you know whether it's leaking

373
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
selectively leaking

374
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,240
parts of real documents and putting them

375
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,680
with fake documents

376
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,959
or altering the data in any sort of way

377
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,279
it becomes really hard for the courts or

378
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,200
really any institution to come out and

379
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,639
correct the record

380
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
with real information once the bad

381
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,800
information once the bad or manipulated

382
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,639
documents or data has already been

383
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,519
leaked to the public

384
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
but now i wanted to turn really to some

385
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,959
of that disinformation that we're

386
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,000
talking about

387
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,279
uh so i like to start with this

388
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,040
incident in twin falls idaho this is

389
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,639
from a few years ago

390
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,600
uh it was a situation where there was a

391
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,639
young girl

392
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,760
who was um allegedly taken into

393
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
a basement by syrian refugees held at

394
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,720
knife point and raped and it was

395
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,560
just a very very horrible um story

396
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
in actuality it came out later that

397
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,839
um something untoward had happened in

398
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,040
this basement but

399
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
there were no syrian refugees no knife

400
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,639
point no rape those were all

401
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,480
embellishments that have been added and

402
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
exaggerations that have been added later

403
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,959
first by rumors and then spread by

404
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,240
russian media

405
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
uh russian agents from the internet

406
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
research agency had been pushing this

407
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,320
narrative on state-sponsored media

408
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
as well as uh social media and so

409
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,959
here are just some examples of uh

410
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,560
you know the the ira uh ira tweets kind

411
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,079
of going after the prosecutor going

412
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,839
after the judge really kind of pushing

413
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,720
this narrative

414
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,440
that the court was against uh this

415
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,959
little girl they were siding with the

416
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,240
syrian refugees

417
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,079
over um the the american citizen in this

418
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,120
situation

419
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,839
and you your immediate sense might be

420
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,519
well why didn't law enforcement or why

421
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,040
didn't you know the courts come out and

422
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,160
correct the record

423
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,839
and in this particular case because

424
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,279
there were minors involved there were

425
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,360
certain privacy laws in place which made

426
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,320
it such that

427
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,480
um they couldn't come out and share the

428
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
real details or correct the record

429
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,199
um by the time they were able to do so

430
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,040
the disinformation had already been out

431
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
there for long enough

432
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
making it very difficult to actually say

433
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,920
what had happened

434
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
and by then a lot of the damage is

435
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,760
already done

436
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,079
this is also from that same situation

437
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,480
secured borders was a facebook group

438
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,279
that was

439
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,959
posting about the situation trying to

440
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,720
start a rally and bring people out into

441
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,920
the streets again

442
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,079
citizens before refugees getting people

443
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,680
riled up in the city saying that the

444
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,160
courts and the institution were um

445
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,800
siding against this little girl um but

446
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,440
again this

447
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,199
isn't you know a group of concerned

448
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
american citizens that were trying to

449
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,279
uh you know fix a wrong that had been

450
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,040
done by the court this was a foreign

451
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,839
adversary coming in and trying to spread

452
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,399
misinformation

453
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,920
about what was actually happening in

454
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,719
that situation

455
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,720
so these are the some four narrative

456
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,519
frames

457
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,279
that we've seen with russian

458
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,279
disinformation against the courts

459
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,399
kind of like the twin falls case we see

460
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,680
situations where they talk about the

461
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,440
justice system covering up crimes

462
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,279
committed by immigrants

463
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,440
we see narratives about the justice

464
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,680
system operationalizing a racist and

465
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,440
corrupt police state

466
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
we've seen things about the justice

467
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
system supporting and enabling corporate

468
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,160
corruption

469
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
and how the justice system is a tool of

470
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,920
the political elite

471
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
these are narratives that similar to the

472
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
twin false case are either

473
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
spread on social media state-sponsored

474
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
media and in some instances

475
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
with higher ranking officials within the

476
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
actual russian government

477
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,920
and so i i bring up this case

478
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,839
of the courts and the narratives that

479
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,519
we're seeing for a few reasons one

480
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,360
is as you can see from the four

481
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,560
narratives here

482
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,120
um they really don't play to any single

483
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,880
political side i mean there's some that

484
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,279
are

485
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,800
you know you would associate more left

486
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,279
leaning issues or trigger issues or

487
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,399
right leaning kind of

488
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,440
issues um that that would

489
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
kind of get people riled up on that side

490
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
and we've even seen in some instances

491
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,680
where

492
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,959
in this one specific case you'll have

493
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,160
um you know accounts weighing in on both

494
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,440
sides of the issue

495
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
even though they're coming from groups

496
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,440
like the internet research agency

497
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,519
which is all to show that sometimes

498
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,279
disinformation is not intended to kind

499
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,639
of prove a single truth

500
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,800
but instead to kind of get people to

501
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,959
disengage to kind of feel like the

502
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,639
institution as a whole

503
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,399
is um kind of broken or inept um and and

504
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,560
really kind of get people to not just

505
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
uh you know not trust maybe this

506
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,240
information but also any other

507
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,920
information that's coming out from the

508
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,720
courts to

509
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,839
correct the record or any other uh

510
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,480
verified institutions that are trying to

511
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,639
speak on this issue

512
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,000
but the other thing that i really want

513
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
to highlight here is you know not only

514
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,639
is this

515
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,160
just the justice system we've seen

516
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,839
similar narratives like this

517
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,680
for other institutions as well i'm just

518
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,759
focusing on the justice system here

519
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,000
but these are really things that are

520
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
happening

521
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,920
every day it's not just one case or

522
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,279
one-off cases here and there

523
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,639
disinformation and and democracy

524
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,920
undermining threats are

525
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
constant and so institutions can't

526
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,160
really wait until that one

527
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,480
big situation whether it's something

528
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,160
like a twin falls idaho case where it's

529
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,600
just a big case that

530
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,039
everyone's kind of looking at or some

531
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,799
sort of big cyber attack

532
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,959
to start building their initiatives that

533
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
are focusing on strengthening public

534
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,520
trust

535
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
um those are things that you know even

536
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,679
if an institution

537
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,400
is uh not thinking that they'll be

538
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
caught up in some sort of situation like

539
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,640
this

540
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,119
or they're not really thinking about how

541
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,359
these larger narratives could play into

542
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,799
what they're actually doing

543
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,400
in truth these narratives are so

544
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
pervasive and they're kind of

545
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
already setting a foundation so that

546
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
even if there is some sort of big cyber

547
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,799
attack it's really easy to kind of drive

548
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,400
uh the narratives around that cyber

549
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
attack into one of these

550
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,440
pre-existing narratives that have

551
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,200
already been um

552
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,840
set up you know well in advance

553
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
so a little bit about what we are doing

554
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
with the court specifically

555
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,720
um in the run-up to the election like i

556
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,600
said we we

557
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
did some state court workshops with the

558
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,520
national center for state courts and the

559
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,280
american bar association

560
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
in partnership with the brunswick group

561
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,799
and exadec

562
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,679
and really the the point of those we

563
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,280
brought in the state courts

564
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,840
um we'd have like three to five states

565
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
uh come in per workshop these were two

566
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,880
day workshops

567
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,600
each state team would bring in a group

568
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,880
of people that included

569
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,000
not just um kind of their their their

570
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
tech and cyber experts but really their

571
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
public communications folks their judges

572
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,240
uh sometimes the courts

573
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,760
the retired judges bar leaders anyone

574
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,960
that they thought from their team

575
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,320
should be involved in these kind of

576
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,200
conversations about addressing and

577
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,120
rebuilding trust after a cyber

578
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,559
disinformation attack

579
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,720
so we ran them through as a big cyber

580
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,799
and disinformation tabletop exercises

581
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,520
that kind of

582
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
again brings in that combination of of

583
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,280
uh

584
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,760
an attack that includes elements of both

585
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,640
cyber and dis

586
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,520
like a hard cyber and disinformation

587
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,240
attack

588
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,080
the next part was we had a playbook

589
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
development session where we work with

590
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,360
the judges and the other

591
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
individuals that are part of those state

592
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,640
teams to think through what are the

593
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,720
appropriate response mechanisms that we

594
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
need to have in place

595
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
um in advance of an attack to make sure

596
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
that we're properly prepared

597
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,280
but a lot of these states they didn't

598
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,039
have the luxury of just dealing with

599
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,799
you know how do we prepare for this in

600
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,559
advance a lot of them were dealing with

601
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,520
this

602
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,880
you know at the time that they were

603
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,720
calling in or had recently come out of a

604
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,760
cyber incident

605
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,120
and we're really trying to think through

606
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,559
what are the things that we need to

607
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,400
think about to rebuild trust in our

608
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,280
court what was

609
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,799
lost um you know maybe it was a specific

610
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,840
type of

611
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,880
information was accessed or maybe um it

612
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,520
was a

613
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,280
disinformation around a certain case but

614
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,360
they really were taking a step back and

615
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,640
taking stock of

616
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,440
how did that attack really impact the

617
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,679
trust and levels of confidence in that

618
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,000
court and their decisions moving forward

619
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,799
um and the last thing that we did which

620
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,200
kind of just helped our study but really

621
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
is something that we've just constantly

622
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,559
thought about we've done focus groups

623
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,640
with how disinformation

624
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,280
kind of sits with different individuals

625
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,840
what

626
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
their kind of takeaways are what that

627
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
means for their trusted institutions

628
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,919
and unfortunately i mean it does impact

629
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,520
the levels of trust that individuals

630
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
have so

631
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
it's not something that we can just kind

632
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,159
of ignore and hope it goes away there

633
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,320
have to be active steps taken

634
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,280
to make sure that we're addressing any

635
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,960
of the disinformation that comes up

636
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
so just a little bit on the the playbook

637
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,720
overview that we did with the brunswick

638
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,400
group and with the state courts

639
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,120
i'll skip the first step just because um

640
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,440
yes

641
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
it's great to build resilience before a

642
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,960
cyber event happens and we do walk them

643
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,480
through that but the point of this

644
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
presentation is more what do you do

645
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,640
after after something after there's a

646
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,000
big cyber incident

647
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,720
and i would say you know steps two and

648
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
three kind of blend together because

649
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,480
yes it's very important to identify the

650
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,240
right team and response plan and create

651
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,919
that response option

652
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,400
um i would say here that when it comes

653
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,600
to right team

654
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,919
the main thing is making sure that just

655
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,679
because it's a cyber incident

656
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,440
it's not just the quote-unquote cyber

657
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,799
people that are in the room

658
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,960
um there's a reason that we specifically

659
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,000
have the the

660
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,320
communications team but then also the

661
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,880
judges or the kind of other allies of

662
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,080
the courts

663
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,840
or lawyers that are affiliated with that

664
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
court coming in because it is really an

665
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,600
all hands on deck situation when you're

666
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,760
trying to think of rebuilding trust

667
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,400
or responding to a cyber incident in the

668
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,440
proper way

669
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,720
and when you're thinking about the

670
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,520
messaging and the best practices there

671
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,600
it's just as important to think about

672
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,200
who is doing the messaging

673
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,679
as it is what you're actually trying to

674
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,960
convey to the public

675
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
so for instance going back to the twin

676
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,640
falls idaho case

677
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
you have a situation where

678
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,600
the judges and the law enforcement

679
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,440
officials were not able to come out and

680
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,120
quickly correct the record

681
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
because there were privacy laws in place

682
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
that prevented them from doing so

683
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,440
so to make sure that you're quickly

684
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,039
addressing that disinformation some of

685
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,320
the things that we tell judges for

686
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,000
instance is we practice

687
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,080
thinking through how can retired judges

688
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,679
be brought into the conversation to

689
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,960
maybe talk through

690
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
procedure and process in a way that

691
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,000
maybe the sitting

692
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
judge might not be able to or how do you

693
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,720
find kind of those unlikely allies

694
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
um that can kind of speak on behalf of

695
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,320
the court and talk about the court's

696
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
integrity of process

697
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,559
and integrity procedure even if you know

698
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,000
there might be disagreements on

699
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
you know specific cases or decisions and

700
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,159
stuff um it's always important to have

701
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:30,559
those

702
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,159
people lined up and ready to speak on

703
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,080
behalf of your institution as you're in

704
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,240
that process of trying to rebuild and

705
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,120
recover

706
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,000
after a cyber incident so with companies

707
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,520
that could mean

708
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,159
maybe you know other industry experts or

709
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,280
competitors that again

710
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
might have vested interest in being

711
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,120
competition in other regards but when it

712
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,080
comes to

713
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
dealing with a cyber incident for

714
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,280
instance

715
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,960
those could be folks in certain

716
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,600
instances that you turn to to help with

717
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,480
that messaging

718
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
as you're rebuilding and coming out of

719
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,600
um out of an incident

720
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,919
so these are just a few of the specific

721
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,440
examples i was pulling out in terms of

722
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
like the actual communication

723
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,640
strategies and and tricks that uh

724
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,120
you know we we tell the judges to do as

725
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,720
they're thinking about how to rebuild

726
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,320
and come out of

727
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,120
a cyber incident so you know things like

728
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,720
meeting with facts and avoid repeating

729
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,640
disinformation or kind of building those

730
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,559
relationships with stakeholders

731
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,960
um training and testing responses all of

732
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,559
those things are basically i'm sure a

733
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,679
lot of you have

734
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,039
have thought through that um as you were

735
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,400
you know thinking about some of these

736
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
issues i will say the last one is

737
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,080
particularly important just in terms of

738
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
speaking clearly and

739
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
and easily when communicating with the

740
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,640
public and media

741
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,320
it seems pretty straightforward but it's

742
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,840
something that we've had to always kind

743
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,320
of

744
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,640
re-emphasize especially with um the

745
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
legal community like don't kind of keep

746
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,000
the conversation

747
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
in in like legalese and and in the cyber

748
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,520
context don't

749
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,200
kind of make the conversation too

750
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
technical so that um the public is not

751
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,039
able to like engage with the concept or

752
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,000
understand what's going

753
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
on so that especially when you're

754
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,440
talking about rebuilding trust

755
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,600
is a is a huge issue that we kind of

756
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,039
keep emphasizing

757
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,360
um but then the last one is is really

758
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,400
important and the

759
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,799
um the conversation across all the

760
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,000
different workshops so

761
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,240
somehow kind of steer in this direction

762
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,120
and that is

763
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,600
um how can we use civic education to

764
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,320
help equip

765
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,440
citizens to withstand disinformation and

766
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,720
and really help us

767
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,400
in that kind of rebuilding and

768
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,120
recovering process

769
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,640
so these are two of our uh csis ddi

770
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,679
reports

771
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,440
that kind of detail the nature of the

772
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,760
threat go into a little bit of detail

773
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,559
about

774
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,240
um you know how you can recover or build

775
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,799
resilience against some of these threats

776
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,640
but i do want to highlight that in both

777
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,320
of them you know one of the key

778
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,039
takeaways

779
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,200
is the threat landscape is constantly

780
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,960
changing especially when you're talking

781
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,400
about disinformation or

782
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,360
cyber attacks against institutions and

783
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,919
so with that in mind i mean obviously

784
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,240
there's going to be technical solutions

785
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,760
there's going to be ways that you can

786
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,960
try to shore up any sort of

787
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,159
vulnerability

788
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,480
but you need to have something that can

789
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,000
grow over overall societal

790
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,320
resilience um you need to have a way

791
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,480
that you know even if you're doing all

792
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,440
of this

793
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
pre-planning and preparedness to

794
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,039
communicate with the public you have to

795
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,720
have a public that's willing to engage

796
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,919
with you in the first place you have to

797
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,039
have a public that's

798
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,799
receptive to any messaging that you're

799
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,320
putting out there um

800
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,000
and and willing to kind of work with you

801
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,520
to bring you know companies or

802
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,559
institutions

803
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,440
back um after any sort of major incident

804
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,600
so with that in mind i mean that's how

805
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,440
we've kind of landed on this idea that

806
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,799
civic education

807
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,559
and and really reinvigorated civic

808
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,400
education that includes components of

809
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,760
civic literacy

810
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,799
um sorry media literacy and uh critical

811
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,360
think

812
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,919
critical thinking training those are all

813
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,279
things that can be

814
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,919
kind of added to to help society kind of

815
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,960
move forward after any sort of incident

816
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,279
this is not something that we alone kind

817
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,679
of have been thinking about

818
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,200
some major commissions have also

819
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,640
similarly landed on these kind of

820
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,000
conclusions

821
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,240
the national commission on military and

822
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,440
national public

823
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,880
the national commission on military and

824
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,799
public service excuse me and

825
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,400
the national cyberspace solarium

826
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,919
commission

827
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,480
both have strong recommendations in

828
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,440
support of

829
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,679
reinvigorating civic education as a way

830
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,799
to support

831
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,320
some of their major foundational

832
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,120
recommendations they think that for some

833
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,559
of their recommendations to stick and

834
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,480
really take hold and be effective

835
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,799
you need to have that kind of informed

836
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,600
and engaged citizenry

837
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,720
available as well and so you know i

838
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,080
in the interest of time i won't spend

839
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,840
too much on this but

840
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,320
really i mean from the national security

841
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,240
perspective

842
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,480
we strongly see there as being a way to

843
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
integrate stem education with civic

844
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,880
education they must reinforce each other

845
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,880
um and and truly having that resilient

846
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,919
uh society is a way that we grow

847
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,600
and fight and have that societal

848
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,760
resilience against ongoing cyber

849
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,919
and cyber enabled threats um one thing

850
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,000
that we constantly focus on is

851
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,559
you know it's not just the important to

852
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,080
make sure that we have the best and the

853
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,640
brightest

854
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,600
innovating and working um in whether

855
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
it's the tech industry or just larger

856
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,039
cyber field in general

857
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,559
it's also important that all those

858
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,320
individuals have that kind of civic

859
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,240
consciousness civic awareness as they go

860
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,440
about

861
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,159
their their day-to-day lives and and

862
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,520
have their careers especially

863
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,960
considering the ways that those

864
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,279
companies are kind of at the front lines

865
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,799
um and and helping us either deal with

866
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,880
any sort of cyber incident or themselves

867
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,720
kind of targets of

868
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,760
cyber attacks and so having that kind of

869
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,919
civically aware public both in the

870
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,320
companies themselves but also receptive

871
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,679
uh in the larger american public is

872
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,360
um is definitely key

873
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
and so i think you know of course that

874
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,799
that seems like a separate tangent

875
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,919
you're like well that's great civic

876
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,840
education is important but

877
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,080
how does that you know help us when

878
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
we're trying to

879
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,200
rebuild or come out of an immediate

880
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
cyber attack or cyber incident

881
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,679
um i did want to just point you to our

882
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,480
civics

883
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,960
strategic dialogue series at csis it's a

884
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
public event series

885
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,399
um here are some of the events that

886
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,320
we've had with justice's

887
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,760
gorsuch and sotomayor we recently had

888
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,640
fbi director chris wray uh microsoft's

889
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,760
president

890
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,919
brad smith and former dhs secretary jay

891
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,279
johnson and

892
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,320
what all of them have kind of um really

893
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
pushed in their in their differing

894
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,440
speeches with something along the lines

895
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,960
of how important it is

896
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,559
for their industries and for national

897
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,640
security as a whole to have that

898
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,080
civically informed

899
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,640
um you know workforce but to also have

900
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
that larger

901
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,279
um you know engaged citizenry

902
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,760
and again it seems like something that

903
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,399
wouldn't come

904
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,399
top of mind when you're thinking of how

905
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,919
to rebuild trust

906
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,720
after any sort of cyber attack but in

907
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,520
truth i mean

908
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,679
civics is something that's been

909
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,679
deprioritized so much over the decades

910
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,240
um to the point that you know right now

911
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,679
you know the the federal spending on

912
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,520
stem is somewhere around like fifty four

913
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,159
dollars

914
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
per school child annually versus for

915
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,559
civics it's around five cents per school

916
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,399
child annually

917
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,240
and this is a no way to say you know we

918
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,480
should take away any funding from stem

919
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,679
or that we should kind of

920
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,919
stop or slow that down anyway because

921
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,760
that is very critical to

922
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,200
to enhancing our national security but

923
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,520
there are ways that civics can and

924
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,039
should be integrated into that

925
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,840
conversation

926
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,520
especially for cyber related stem um

927
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,360
courses and and when we're thinking

928
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,559
about how

929
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,919
uh companies and institutions um you

930
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,000
know need to engage with the public

931
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,840
later on i mean in truth institutions

932
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,559
that are able to be held accountable or

933
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,919
able to kind of

934
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,120
um interact or show that they're

935
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,200
you know engaged with the larger public

936
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
those are the institutions that are able

937
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,720
to kind of garner that trust

938
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,520
and and um again that's not something

939
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,120
that can happen overnight and it just

940
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
kind of reinforces again

941
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,720
that this is a conversation that can't

942
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,000
happen after the cyber

943
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
incident this really needs to be planned

944
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,360
out ahead of time

945
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,600
um so that you know god forbid if you do

946
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,799
end up in a situation where you're

947
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,080
trying to rebuild

948
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,000
um you know after an incident you're in

949
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,520
a much better position to do so

950
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,559
and so you know the there are four kind

951
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,080
of takeaways that i sprinkled in

952
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,679
throughout the presentation

953
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,840
um but i do want to end on this last one

954
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,720
which is

955
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,039
how do you train to fight in the light

956
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,120
um it's something that suzanne our our

957
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,880
director of our project kind of always

958
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,720
ends on she very eloquently talks about

959
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,520
how

960
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,240
um you know the shelf life of secrets is

961
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,080
vanishingly thin and so that's why we

962
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,519
need to fight in the light and what she

963
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,279
means by that is you know we're moving

964
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,080
into a time

965
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,120
where it is increasingly difficult

966
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,039
almost impossible to keep secrets

967
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,799
especially with the types of cyber

968
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,600
attacks

969
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,640
or or just cyber attacks and breaches

970
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,120
that we're

971
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,080
considering today and even if we do have

972
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,000
secrets they're really expensive to kind

973
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,840
of keep in today's day and age

974
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,720
so moving towards more transparent

975
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,480
systems really is

976
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,159
um something that companies should think

977
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,840
about anyway but especially when they're

978
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,080
thinking about rebuilding after

979
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,559
any sort of incident and i'm not talking

980
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,480
about any sort of like radical

981
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,519
um you know overnight changes that

982
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,480
uh you know insist on some sort of

983
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,840
transparency

984
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,120
but instead institutions

985
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,559
taking steps to actually um you know

986
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,320
whenever there is a situation where they

987
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,679
can err on the side of being more

988
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,640
transparent

989
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,480
trying to do so that's really difficult

990
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,919
to do especially when you're thinking

991
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:58,640
about

992
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,279
cyber there's kind of this um this

993
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,880
tendency to feel like you need to keep

994
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,159
close hold to

995
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,600
the nature of the the attack or or um

996
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,120
you know some of the information taken

997
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,039
or things like that but in truth

998
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,960
wherever it is possible to be

999
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
transparent that might be the best

1000
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,760
course of action

1001
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,320
um if for nothing else i mean yes it

1002
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,880
does help rebuild trust which is crucial

1003
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,960
but that is also the way that the world

1004
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
is moving in that's the reality of

1005
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,640
today's situation so

1006
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,559
the institutions the companies that are

1007
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,399
able to kind of lean into that and

1008
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,080
prepare for that and anticipate that

1009
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,720
better

1010
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,600
are the ones that are going to um to

1011
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,120
definitely thrive and succeed in the

1012
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,000
future

1013
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,799
so uh with that i will stop my screen

1014
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,240
share again thank you for listening to

1015
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,679
my presentation

1016
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,720
um and uh yeah i look forward to hearing

1017
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,840
any questions you might have

1018
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,880
man so as someone who works in

1019
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,039
intelligence that like definitely

1020
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,480
hit me hard right and i wanted like a

1021
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,159
comment that someone made to me early on

1022
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,159
working he says there's military-grade

1023
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,720
weaponry being used against the public

1024
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,679
via social media and i think this isn't

1025
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,880
hit on enough

1026
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,000
in the general sense of the population

1027
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,559
of how much that's really going on and

1028
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,760
it scares me a lot

1029
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,000
just because of that but that was an

1030
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,440
awesome presentation

1031
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
you should definitely look at giving

1032
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,840
that at other places

1033
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,240
her daughter needed some attention so

1034
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,399
it's just me uh if we have any

1035
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,240
any questions in the discord please let

1036
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
me know otherwise i can talk your ear

1037
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,360
off on just for the next 15 minutes too

1038
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,360
um i've uh posted the two

1039
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,080
articles that you did that you showed in

1040
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,880
your

1041
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,559
presentation in the chat as well which

1042
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,960
i'm probably going to read after this

1043
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,240
um so there's the link to

1044
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,360
okay um what do you think

1045
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,640
is for a normal person what's the best

1046
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,440
defense

1047
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,480
against these type of attacks

1048
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,440
so um one of the things that's kind of

1049
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,320
concerned us

1050
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,399
is you know when you're trying to talk

1051
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,159
about like what should be media literacy

1052
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,359
or what are the things that you need to

1053
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:13,760
do

1054
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,119
it almost seems like you're trying to

1055
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,879
force some sort of top-down solution of

1056
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,159
like this is what you should believe

1057
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,280
this is what you shouldn't believe and

1058
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,199
this is how you should you know

1059
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,040
uh think about these things and that's

1060
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,960
why we've really kind of leaned back on

1061
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,239
that whole like thinking of a

1062
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,040
reinvigorated civics that also combines

1063
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
media literacy and cyber security

1064
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,440
awareness basic cyber hygiene

1065
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,760
we're trying to find ways to kind of uh

1066
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,520
put all of that together

1067
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,639
so that um you know people are kind of

1068
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,719
they're informed of the basics they're

1069
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,399
informed of how to

1070
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,719
navigate their day-to-day lives in ways

1071
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,480
that are secure like basic things like

1072
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,320
you know don't click on pause links or

1073
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,199
like don't

1074
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,839
you know constantly like or repost

1075
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,199
things that you're seeing on social

1076
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,480
media like those are basic things that

1077
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,920
we can teach to everyone

1078
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,400
um but it kind of just puts that

1079
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,079
awareness in the back of people's heads

1080
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:02,720
so you know

1081
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,000
you can still believe what you want you

1082
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
can still search for the information

1083
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,119
that you want

1084
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,359
but you're kind of a more informed and

1085
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,960
engaged citizen that's the kind of term

1086
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
that we we keep pushing

1087
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,720
um so in terms of what is the the big

1088
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,680
takeaway

1089
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,200
or the big thing that they can do to

1090
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,960
kind of protect themselves

1091
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,760
um obviously like you know until some of

1092
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,440
those bigger programs are

1093
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,760
established and built out make sure that

1094
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,599
you're kind of aware of all the basic

1095
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,760
cyber hygiene rules and inactively

1096
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,040
practicing them

1097
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,920
um that i'm sure everyone on the in the

1098
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,640
group

1099
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,480
would say that they'll not be emphasized

1100
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,000
enough um

1101
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and then uh in terms of the civic side

1102
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,040
of things you know

1103
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,160
we're not just talking about what are

1104
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,520
the three branches of government we're

1105
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,440
talking about like what are the actual

1106
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,240
things

1107
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,160
that um you know our institutions are

1108
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,680
doing and um

1109
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,520
you know how are ways that we can hold

1110
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,960
our institutions accountable and if

1111
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,400
you're interested in those kind of

1112
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,119
things

1113
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,280
um there's the civics renewal network

1114
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,200
and civ x now

1115
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,520
both of them are really big networks

1116
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,599
that have education tools that really

1117
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,359
can kind of meet users

1118
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,760
uh where they're at in terms of what

1119
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,880
they're interested in what they're

1120
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,920
concerned about

1121
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,680
a lot of different resources from a lot

1122
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,359
of different organizations that are

1123
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,079
there

1124
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,359
um so i really just encourage people to

1125
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,440
check out the resources there because it

1126
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,800
really does um

1127
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,640
give you a sense of why it's important

1128
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,800
again to have trust in institutions

1129
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,920
uh gives you a little better

1130
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,839
appreciation of what's maybe

1131
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,480
uh what why these are areas of concern

1132
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:30,880
um

1133
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,119
and and again just gives you that sense

1134
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,960
of awareness so as you're operating and

1135
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,800
navigating your day-to-day life

1136
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,200
um you're also just kind of keeping

1137
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,520
those basic security measures um

1138
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,560
in the back of your mind as well

1139
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,640
i love i love the way you guys are going

1140
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,000
at it with the courts as well it's

1141
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,839
almost like you're trying to stem the

1142
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,920
disinformation before it even exists

1143
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,880
right you're

1144
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
you're not just putting a band-aid over

1145
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,839
it you're solving the problem before it

1146
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,960
happens which is

1147
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,800
awesome and mind-blowing like i

1148
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,960
literally have the conversation of this

1149
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,839
with like friends weekly about hey you

1150
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,920
shouldn't post this and here's why

1151
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,240
so it just blows my mind that there's an

1152
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,079
actual group out there who's preaching

1153
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,320
it and i had no clue about it

1154
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
and it makes it honestly makes me really

1155
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,880
happy that you guys do stuff like this

1156
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,839
um yeah i can't even like like i'm

1157
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,720
emotional

1158
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,480
i will say though that one of the

1159
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,880
unfortunate things is so i mean even how

1160
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,040
we started looking at this is because

1161
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,440
um suzanne spaulding who's the director

1162
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,320
of our program when she came out of dhs

1163
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,880
she was there in 2016 so you know saw

1164
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
what was happening with the elections

1165
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,720
the disinformation operations happening

1166
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,359
there

1167
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,720
and so she really thought she was

1168
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,400
getting out ahead of this um

1169
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,880
she is a lawyer by training and so

1170
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,720
really wanted to see you know what other

1171
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,000
institutions that are critical

1172
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,599
to our democracy could be impacted or

1173
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,440
could be targets of disinformation

1174
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,480
campaigns so

1175
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,400
she started digging around she saw where

1176
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,599
there's an opportunity for

1177
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,520
disinformation hoping that you know she

1178
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,880
was getting out ahead of this but

1179
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,560
unfortunately i mean

1180
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
kind of as you were saying in some of

1181
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,920
these institutions they have been

1182
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,040
targets for some

1183
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,800
time they've kind of gone in the

1184
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,400
crosshairs of

1185
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
other larger democracy undermining

1186
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,440
narratives so

1187
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
you know people think of the elections

1188
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,960
being the big times when you see

1189
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,079
disinformation

1190
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,800
pop up um but in truth i mean it's just

1191
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,200
so

1192
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,880
easy and cheap to kind of disinformation

1193
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,160
operation that

1194
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,200
um you're seeing institutions

1195
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,599
uh kind of they're not they're no longer

1196
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,240
getting

1197
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,359
caught in the crosshairs they're

1198
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,680
becoming direct targets and so

1199
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,760
um you know it becomes all the more

1200
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,119
important that

1201
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,960
um institutions are prepared for that

1202
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,040
and again it's not just russia it's

1203
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,960
now a lot of times domestic voices that

1204
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,720
are doing it a lot of other nations have

1205
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,280
taken a

1206
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,119
page out of that playbook and are

1207
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,040
similarly spreading disinformation when

1208
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,480
it's convenient so

1209
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,160
that's another reason why we kind of

1210
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
lean back on that how do you build

1211
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,880
resilience side of things um because it

1212
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,720
has to be threat agnostic it's really

1213
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,680
hard to

1214
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,560
to detect where it's coming from at all

1215
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,680
times

1216
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,480
uh how much research do you guys do into

1217
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
the actual like campaigns and like the

1218
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,400
so like the twitter bots and like

1219
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,760
actually tracking them and stuff like

1220
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,400
that

1221
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,119
yeah so it that's probably the hardest

1222
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:19,520
part

1223
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
just because a lot of the information

1224
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,440
that we used for even like that

1225
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,839
the beyond the ballot report that i

1226
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:26,880
showed earlier

1227
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,599
um those were accounts that were

1228
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,400
verified

1229
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,280
by the platforms that the platforms

1230
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,200
identified as coming from

1231
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,599
the internet research agency a lot of

1232
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,880
the accounts were those that were

1233
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,400
published by

1234
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,800
the senate intelligence committee so we

1235
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,839
kind of have that

1236
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,320
100 you know verification that that's

1237
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,480
who we're talking about in those cases

1238
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,560
a lot of times we can go and look into

1239
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,760
different networks

1240
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,160
um pretty much thinking that they might

1241
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,800
be from

1242
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,680
x y or z bad actor but we don't actually

1243
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,480
have

1244
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,200
a way to verify like if it's actually

1245
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,839
coming from an adversary versus

1246
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,599
a regular american citizen which again

1247
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,560
they still could be spreading

1248
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,720
misinformation but the consequences and

1249
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,079
the way you respond

1250
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,440
could be slightly different based on

1251
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,720
where you're coming where it's coming

1252
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,440
from

1253
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,520
uh which is why we always have to say

1254
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,119
that

1255
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,160
this is the the reports that we're uh

1256
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,640
showing or the the examples we're

1257
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,280
showing

1258
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,319
are just to show i guess the the types

1259
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,839
of disinformation that's out there but

1260
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,800
we can never really

1261
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,599
make comments about the full size or

1262
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,440
scope or scale of

1263
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,599
um of these disinformation attacks just

1264
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,200
because we don't have eyes on

1265
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
on what's actually out there and that's

1266
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,720
one of the things that a lot and

1267
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,839
a lot of people in the research

1268
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,160
community are trying to push for um

1269
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,800
how to get just more timely data from

1270
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,200
the

1271
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,640
um from the platforms themselves um

1272
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,480
and and ways that we can kind of just do

1273
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,240
a better job of sharing that information

1274
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,599
so we can come out with

1275
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,000
some of these larger takeaways and raise

1276
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,720
awareness

1277
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,920
um with the american public um

1278
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
yeah we are we are greatly limited in

1279
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,960
the um

1280
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,319
the uh the abilities to kind of fully do

1281
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,680
a scan of um the narratives coming

1282
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,720
up against the courts for instance yeah

1283
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,920
so my uh i live my life by like three

1284
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,680
basic quotes that my parents always used

1285
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,760
to ruin me right and one was like

1286
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,839
uh when in doubt gas on so like always

1287
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:24,800
go for it

1288
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,480
and then my mom always used to say like

1289
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,240
life isn't fair so i always just always

1290
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,960
remember that

1291
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,880
but my dad always hammered one into me

1292
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,400
which is believe nothing what you hear

1293
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,240
and half of what you see right

1294
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,319
so whenever i read anything on there and

1295
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,280
i'm like all right

1296
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,400
half of that's true but oh wow you're

1297
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,440
i'm gonna i'm gonna have a lot of

1298
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,280
reading that's probably the the bumper

1299
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,480
sticker that we should have

1300
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,040
when we present things just have that

1301
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,440
have that healthy sense of paranoia

1302
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,040
um as you're reading things we try to

1303
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,560
make it such that people are

1304
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,240
are just paranoid enough that they're

1305
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,319
being critical consumers of information

1306
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,040
but not

1307
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,040
too worried that they're completely

1308
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,160
detaching

1309
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,480
from being engaged participants because

1310
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,760
that that that's

1311
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,440
that's the end of that consequence right

1312
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,000
like that's how you ruin a democracy by

1313
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,040
not having people

1314
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,160
fully freely um engage in society so

1315
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,680
striking that balance is

1316
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,760
is another thing that's just tricky but

1317
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,800
um

1318
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,160
trying to trying to figure out a way to

1319
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,240
do that that edge wow

1320
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,839

1325
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,240
