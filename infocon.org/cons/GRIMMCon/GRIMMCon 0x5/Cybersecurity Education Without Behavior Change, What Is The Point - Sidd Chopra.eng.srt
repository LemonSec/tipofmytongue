1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,400
so so wait a second are you saying that

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,760
artificial intelligence

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,439
isn't real i didn't say it wasn't real

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,680
i said it is not operational at the

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
level where it is driving these things

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,480
well can you do me a favor can you tell

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,080
me when actual intelligence

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,960
is operational and that's back to where

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
we were just making the joke and why

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,480
tricia was looking forward to your talk

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
because it's about people

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,399
ah but well so trisha i think i'm gonna

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,640
have to have your help

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,239
because i'm an i.t and i'm not good at

15
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,959
talking to people

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
you haven't heard that before really

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,800
okay well i'm gonna ask that question

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,440
right off the bat what's wrong with

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,199
communication

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
in cyber security in your chat in the

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,479
window

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,479
just tell us what's wrong what have you

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,600
seen

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,640
from your perspective that people do

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,159
wrong when they're communicating about

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,960
cyber security

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,119
i love interactive sessions this is

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,960
great yeah me too

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
uh so folks put that in i think you have

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,640
to put it in as a question

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
um and i'm gonna hop over to discord

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
oh we can't use the chat uh i don't know

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
if the they can use the chat i know that

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,720
they can put

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,200
stuff as a question so we can see it

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,159
there

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,400
um and on discord um

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,520
we've got jovi says not interacting

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,759
kenny says it's not about lifting others

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,280
up it's about lifting oneself

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,960
up interesting um

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,719
well so that's the question i've been

43
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,799
asking for quite some time

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,719
for a little bit of background i got

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,399
hooked on computers when i was in sixth

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:02,960
grade

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,799
went to a summer camp they had at a

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,719
university and it turns out that

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,679
whenever you go to a university

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,480
smart people don't know how to use locks

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
and so we were able to get into the

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,959
computing

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
one of the computer rooms and be able to

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,879
play around with some computers

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
and we found the password was written

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,640
down on some old printouts

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
that had been thrown away in a trash can

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,319
and we were able to get into the system

59
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,000
and start playing games and things like

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,640
that

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,319
now we were in sixth grade so the idea

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,920
of holding them ransom or anything like

63
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,879
that was just completely oblivious to us

64
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,280
we just loved playing games and we found

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,959
out all sorts of games that we could

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,080
play

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440
i don't know what else we could have

68
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
gotten access to

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
and fast forward i got a degree in

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,760
computer science i went i was a system

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
administrator

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
i was a system administrator for the

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
army i worked for sas institute as a

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
senior software developer

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,360
and i did i t security audits for

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
fortune 100 companies and

77
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,159
taught organizations like brink security

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,800
in the tennessee valley authorities um

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,920
power producing companies uh about

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,440
uh cyber security i.t controls

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,519
and one of the things i had learned over

82
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,640
the years is

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,000
that when we present this information

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
too often times we're doing the pump and

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
dump approach

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,159
we're giving a bunch of information and

87
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,040
expecting them to be able to absorb it

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,920
and more importantly to change the way

89
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
they act

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
and that last bit is really difficult

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
and the approach that we've been using

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,440
has some very fundamental flaws that go

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,480
all the way down

94
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,319
to the near the brain level

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,879
to neuroscience and so we've talked to a

96
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,760
number of

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,959
neuroscientists and cognitive

98
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,959
psychologists and behavioral scientists

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,720
and

100
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,879
neuropsychiatrists about 190 people

101
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,840
total

102
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
and we've been working with

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,200
organizations like

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,640
the national institute of standards and

105
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
technology and uh the national

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
initiative for cyber security education

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,239
ways that we are currently presenting

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,200
information

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,879
and looking for ways that we might be

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,519
able to better align it with the way the

111
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,639
brain actually works

112
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,520
so uh apparently i need to share my

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
screen

114
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,199
yep so i just promoted you to a panelist

115
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,080
that was very nice of you it's it's

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,280
really about the little people

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,479
so the question is does this really

118
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,440
matter

119
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,280
does this whole presentation is it just

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,639
pointless

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,600
um elisa did a fantastic job of queuing

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,639
me up

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,360
but i want to take it one step further

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,160
she did

125
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,720
really truly a lot of great information

126
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,160
that she had talked about

127
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
and i wish that you know i could have

128
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
the graphics that nicole had

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,120
and the singing ability bryson and

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
tricia had

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,759
i have none of those things the only

132
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,400
thing i have is hard questions

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,520
and some disturbing answers

134
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,680
so first off does this stuff really

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,880
matter and

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
i want to give you an example of

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,240
something that was created by the

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,039
national

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,280
initiative from the national um

140
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
institute of sanderson technology the

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
national center for

142
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
cyber security education they created

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
this organize this

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,479
document called telework security and

145
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,600
overview and

146
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,440
tip guide now

147
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
i don't really i mean it was great that

148
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,759
they consolidated this information

149
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,759
but and it's a lot of really good

150
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,520
information the problem is

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,639
for me i don't know that this is going

152
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,759
to be easily

153
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,759
absorbed by somebody else and i don't

154
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,960
think it's going to

155
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,919
be retained by them and lastly i don't

156
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,280
think it's going to change anybody's

157
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,840
behavior

158
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,759
what do you see that's prominent in this

159
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,720
uh this this guy this this one sheet

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,319
you see a globe you see a couple of

161
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,960
icons and you see some numbers

162
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,680
now does that improve your understanding

163
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
of telework security

164
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
by looking at those things if you had

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
two seconds to look at this

166
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,680
what would you walk away with my guess

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,720
is probably not a whole lot

168
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
would you be enticed to read more

169
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,120
i suspect probably not you might

170
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
but i think that there's a lot of other

171
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
people in industry

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,440
that probably wouldn't want to look any

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,759
further

174
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,600
so the next question i have for you is

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,479
are you

176
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,080
a law abiding citizen now this is a real

177
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,360
important question because

178
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,720
we we we have some people that

179
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,880
maybe they wouldn't answer yes to uh

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
especially if you're on the hacking side

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
but most of the people that we're going

182
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
to be working with day in and day out

183
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
would like to think that they are

184
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
law-abiding citizens and because they're

185
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,199
law-abiding citizens

186
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,000
they almost always like to do the right

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
thing

188
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,440
almost some of you have seen signs like

189
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,080
this

190
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,919
i'm not going to say everybody but i'm

191
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,560
pretty sure pretty much

192
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,440
99.99 of the population of this

193
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,680
webcast is going to see signs like this

194
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,080
populated all over the place the

195
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,440
question is

196
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,080
how often do you actually follow the

197
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,800
speed limit

198
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,800
what do you do instead

199
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
well chances are you speed what do you

200
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,880
do when you find

201
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
somebody that follows a speed limit

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,720
chances are you get pretty aggravated

203
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,000
why

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
because this is a limit that's standing

205
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,280
in your way

206
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,319
it is some a a break on your

207
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,800
ability to get from point a to point b

208
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
as fast as you want to

209
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
it is an arbitrary limit in many

210
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,960
people's minds

211
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,680
that is opposed upon you and a lot of

212
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,400
people

213
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,120
resent it and even more people ignore it

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
so why do we think that when we create

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
these rules about cyber security and

216
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
tell people this is what you're supposed

217
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,520
to do and this is what you're not

218
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,400
supposed to do

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,840
why do we think that they're going to

220
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,638
follow along

221
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
well you know for them cyber security

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
isn't a life and death situation

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,680
but you know for people that are driving

224
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
around and

225
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
on the highways it can be a very

226
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,000
life-threatening situation if they go

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,279
too fast around a corner

228
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,880
but why don't they do it

229
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,240
well because it impedes progress for

230
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,839
them

231
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,920
and i i suspect some of you have been in

232
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
in situations where

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,040
you are stuck in traffic

234
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
and how do you feel when you can't get

235
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
to where you want to go

236
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
in a timely fashion even if you don't

237
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,320
have to

238
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,680
be there on time it's still incredibly

239
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,360
aggravating

240
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,080
it makes our blood pressure go up we get

241
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,839
our stress levels go up

242
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,760
even if we don't have a a deadline

243
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,880
it's still an impediment that we don't

244
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
like

245
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,080
too often times cyber security is viewed

246
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,440
a very

247
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,480
the very same way so

248
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,760
what's wrong with our approach to cyber

249
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,000
security education

250
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
well i i think that you know as i said

251
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
alyssa did a great job of explaining

252
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,040
some of the things that you're supposed

253
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,320
to do

254
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
i want to do drill down even deeper

255
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,480
why why do we need to do those things

256
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,640
and a lot for a lot of us it's just

257
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,600
because

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,399
the world of communication has changed

259
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,560
we're no longer

260
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
you know having to pick up the phone or

261
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
write letters and put it in the post

262
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,680
office we're using social media we're

263
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,160
using

264
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
messaging and things like that and i

265
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,519
don't know if you've had any kids

266
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,320
uh you can't use those same methods that

267
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
we did when we were growing up to

268
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
communicate to our own kids

269
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,680
and they just ignore us so that's

270
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,959
a problem for a lot of us and

271
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,760
and a lot of us have the problem of uh

272
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
the way we

273
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,279
value communication what we do

274
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,320
has also been impacted and we're not

275
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,240
we don't value the same things as we

276
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,120
used to value

277
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
and we also have a lot more complexity

278
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
more complexity than we've ever had

279
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,079
before

280
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,880
as a species when we were dealing with

281
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,399
especially things like the internet

282
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
this is a network diagram of the

283
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,399
internet the entire internet back in

284
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,519
1975.

285
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,760
i had talked to um a number of

286
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,360
conversations and actually interviews

287
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,680
with

288
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
vince cerf who's one of the inventors of

289
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
of the internet um

290
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
known for tcpip and

291
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,560
we they didn't perceive at the time that

292
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,320
the internet would be as big as it was

293
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,399
it wasn't designed

294
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,959
for the world that we have right now it

295
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:13,839
wasn't

296
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,519
security wasn't the big issue for them

297
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,640
and so we're trying to we've unleashed

298
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,120
this

299
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,440
this wonderful tool this spectacular

300
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,880
tool

301
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,440
and we gave it to the world but we

302
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,120
didn't give them any training on how to

303
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,399
use it

304
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,720
we just let them loose and one of the

305
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,839
things that

306
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,440
dr cerf had talked about was this notion

307
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,040
he said that this wasn't exactly what he

308
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
meant but but we need kind of an

309
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,360
internet driver's license to tell people

310
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
what they need to do

311
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,600
what they don't need to do and things

312
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
like that just a little bit of training

313
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,000
around

314
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,440
how do we have basic cyber security

315
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
hygiene or basic

316
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,560
cyber hygiene in general and that's not

317
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,600
always easy to get people to do it but

318
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,519
the problem is the consequences

319
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,720
of not doing it are dire

320
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,399
because we depend on computers for

321
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
almost everything in fact

322
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,639
we could argue that there is not a

323
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,320
single industry in the world that

324
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
doesn't

325
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,720
use the internet for something

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
and as as such it's a vulnerability

327
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,680
a lot of people didn't realize the

328
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
consequence for all this connectedness

329
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,480
was the security of our information

330
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
our assets and ourselves no one ever

331
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,200
told them that

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
right now

333
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,200
a lot of our approaches unfortunately of

334
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
telling people

335
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,600
security is again as we mentioned the

336
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,120
pump and dump

337
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,560
we're going to throw a bunch of

338
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,040
information at you and hopefully some of

339
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,079
it sticks

340
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,600
it's the same thing as essentially

341
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,800
as as pleasant as verbal vomit

342
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,279
right we want people to listen to us

343
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,200
when we talk we want to be as efficient

344
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,560
as possible

345
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,760
but we're optimizing it for us as the

346
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,800
presenter

347
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,160
and not often the audience

348
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,680
and what they're going to do with the

349
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,279
information and how they're going to

350
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,440
retain that information

351
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
most of us don't spend a lot of time

352
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,480
thinking about that

353
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
and with good reason because in when

354
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,920
we're coming through school

355
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,200
oftentimes the education system we're

356
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,920
exposed to

357
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,560
the lecture format and the problem is

358
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,040
again

359
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,959
the lecture format is optimized for the

360
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,079
presenter

361
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,959
not the audience

362
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,000
george bernard shaw said the single

363
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
biggest problem in communication

364
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,519
is the illusion that it has taken place

365
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,079
and for many of us in the cyber security

366
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,399
many of us in communication in general

367
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,760
this is so true

368
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,240
we think that we've trained people we

369
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,800
think we've done our due diligence

370
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,959
but if we don't get them to actually

371
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,120
change their behavior

372
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,720
all we've done is wasted a whole lot of

373
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,399
time and money

374
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
now that may be kind of provocative

375
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,519
and i'm going to make my case and you

376
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,959
get to decide whether or not

377
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,360
i'm right or wrong but i will tell you

378
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
this

379
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,639
i've given this same talk or a very

380
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,639
similar version of this talk

381
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,320
at the national institute of standards

382
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
and technology to

383
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,040
the federal information security

384
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,000
um systems educators association so

385
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
basically all the cyber security experts

386
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,720
and

387
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,920
cisos and uh whatnot throughout the

388
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,360
federal government

389
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,120
and the gentleman that's sitting there

390
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,399
uh is the

391
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,160
chief information security officer for

392
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,279
the us department of education so

393
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
this has been somewhat vetted i would i

394
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
would hazard to guess and

395
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,040
also vince surf who also viewed this

396
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,560
presentation you can see it yourself

397
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,760
on youtube said this was

398
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
entertaining but also profoundly

399
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,199
disturbingly

400
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,000
correct disturbingly correct

401
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,519
well that's disturbing why are we in

402
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,600
this situation

403
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,440
well it's because we have brains

404
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,880
now for some people this might actually

405
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,199
be uh questionable of the people that

406
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,480
you end up dealing with but i assure you

407
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,920
99.99 of the people you deal with on an

408
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
everyday basis

409
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,240
have brains the problem is a whole lot

410
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,720
of us

411
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,920
don't know how they actually work and

412
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,040
we make a lot of assumptions a whole lot

413
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,639
of assumptions

414
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,000
about how our brain works

415
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,920
and it turns out that our brains are

416
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,360
actually not

417
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,120
wired not wired for

418
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
accuracy they're wired for efficiency

419
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,360
the brain takes up 20 to 25 of our

420
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,560
calories

421
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,519
so essentially most of the time we eat

422
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,480
we're really feeding

423
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,519
one organ and that's the brain

424
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,800
and so it doesn't want to use

425
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,199
all that those resources so it come up

426
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,440
comes up with all kinds of shortcuts

427
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,839
we talk about our gut instinct well that

428
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,600
saves us processing time right

429
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,000
we can evaluate a situation and make a

430
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,279
decision

431
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
very very quickly without having to go

432
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,959
through every single step of the

433
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,240
analysis to come up

434
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,360
with a logical decision

435
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,199
right and that comes up with some

436
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,360
problems because oftentimes we make it

437
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,959
an incorrect decision

438
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,000
but we're part of this is because our

439
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
brain was designed for a world

440
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,079
that we evolved into right

441
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,480
a hundred or a hundred thousand years

442
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,680
ago the world that

443
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,880
we lived in was very different than the

444
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,279
world that we live in today

445
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,519
and our brain was actually evolving

446
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,560
100 000 years ago and over

447
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,520
hundreds of thousands of years this is

448
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,640
the structure that we get today

449
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,959
and the ones that were curious the ones

450
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,199
that had to have all the data to make an

451
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,199
accurate decision

452
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,599
were eaten by the lion that was rustling

453
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,480
in the bushes

454
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,160
and said you know what that that

455
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,760
rustling in the bushes could be a lion

456
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,359
but it could also be a mouse let me go

457
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,599
investigate and find out more well they

458
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,760
removed themselves from the gene pool

459
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
and we got the one that said

460
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,559
you know what i don't like that

461
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,320
i don't know what it is but i'm sure as

462
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,160
hell not gonna find out i'm hightailing

463
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,520
it out of here

464
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,080
that's the ancestor we got the one that

465
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,520
was said you know what i don't need to

466
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,960
have all the information i'm gonna make

467
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,760
a decision

468
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
and get the hell out of here just

469
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
because it scares me

470
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,480
nothing else no other data it scares me

471
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,559
and i'm out of here

472
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,799
well i'm going to give you an example

473
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,559
let's see if we can get you to

474
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,280
experience this discrepancy this problem

475
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,080
ourselves for most of us our primary

476
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,360
perception of the world

477
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,039
is visual seeing is believing right

478
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,120
but it turns out our vision isn't

479
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
actually all that accurate

480
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,880
if you look on this graph this shows you

481
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,480
right here that most of the rods that

482
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,720
see color this is the structure of our

483
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,919
eye that actually sees

484
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,039
color most of it is

485
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,120
just a little bit off the very center of

486
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,200
our vision and it drops off

487
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,679
very quickly as we go away from the

488
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,240
center of our vision

489
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,559
and then in the the cones which see

490
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,760
black and white light intensity

491
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,320
drop off even faster they drop off

492
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,960
almost

493
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,440
immediately the way we get away from the

494
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
center of revision

495
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
and you'll also know this point right

496
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,280
here is called the blind spot

497
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,080
this is where we see absolutely nothing

498
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,440
at all

499
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,640
nothing at all what's the ramifications

500
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,400
of this

501
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
well it turns out that what we see

502
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,080
isn't actually what's actually there

503
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,960
now for for all of you guys see if you

504
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,919
can see

505
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,080
how many of you can actually see all the

506
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
numbers on the left hand side

507
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,600
right can you this is a 25 can you read

508
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,280
this number can you read this number can

509
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
you read this number can you read this

510
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,960
number can you read this number

511
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,480
if you have perfect vision perfect color

512
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,280
acuity

513
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,520
you can see all the numbers on the other

514
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,320
hand

515
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,080
if you have a what they call a

516
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,000
red green color insensitivity

517
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,440
this is what you see i'm

518
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,400
more on the right hand side so i

519
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,520
perceive the world

520
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,200
differently than most of the people

521
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
that are normal have have regular

522
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,360
color uh acuity that don't have any kind

523
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,840
of color

524
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,760
blindness so the percent my perception

525
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,320
of the world

526
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,640
is fundamentally different than yours

527
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,440
and it's biological it's not arbitrary

528
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
it's not me being willful it's not me

529
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,320
being

530
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,120
ornery it is a biological function

531
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,159
and we all have limitations

532
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,720
all of us this is just personal but we

533
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,440
have

534
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,360
bigger limitations that we don't really

535
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
consider often

536
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,559
the image on the right is an example

537
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,679
of what is presented to the brain right

538
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,200
or is presented to our

539
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,400
frontal cortex or decision making center

540
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,159
of our brain

541
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,280
but that's not what the eye sees because

542
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,159
of all those

543
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,520
the the the concentration of the sensors

544
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,120
in our eye that are concentrated in the

545
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,760
very center of our eye

546
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,480
what we really see is more like the

547
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,760
image on the right

548
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,240
it's very clear it's clear in the center

549
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,679
it's got color in the center but as we

550
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,280
get further away from the center

551
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
it fades to black and white and it gets

552
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,720
fuzzier

553
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
now that's what we our eye actually sees

554
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,159
that's the information

555
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,360
actually it's not that information

556
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,520
is flipped upside down that image

557
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,120
actually should be flipped upside down

558
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,320
and there should be a big

559
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,039
black dot in the middle of it or off to

560
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,159
the center

561
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,320
just off the center where our blind spot

562
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,520
is

563
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,080
so our vision is wickedly processed

564
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,120
by our brain and

565
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,799
depending on how our brain the things

566
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,200
that we see in our life

567
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
our brain is going to interpret those

568
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,120
images differently

569
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,639
than if we saw other things

570
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,000
and this this is again this is a

571
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
biological function

572
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,640
right and our perception of the world

573
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,600
is heavily processed and it's processed

574
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,520
by the things the experiences that we've

575
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,840
had

576
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,039
so when somebody paints a picture for

577
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,240
you

578
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,720
of what reality is it's only their

579
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
perception of reality

580
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,280
and it may not be anybody else's you may

581
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,440
be alone in that

582
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,400
so we have to both be cognizant of the

583
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,679
fact that other people are going to see

584
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,960
the world differently

585
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
than us but also that when we

586
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,960
try to communicate that we work hard so

587
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,000
that we can see

588
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,039
their perception of the world because

589
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:39,840
otherwise

590
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,120
we're going to be talking to them and

591
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,640
we're going to be potentially arguing

592
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,080
with them

593
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,799
needlessly because what they see

594
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,000
is different than what we see

595
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,159
so what do we do instead well instead of

596
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,000
trying to expect people to adapt to us

597
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,679
in our communication styles

598
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,120
maybe what we need to do is start

599
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,480
adapting to them what do they need

600
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
and first off actually looking at how

601
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,799
our brain actually works

602
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,960
now this is a mental a model that we've

603
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,640
been working with from neuroscientists

604
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
cognitive psychologists from all over

605
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,799
the world

606
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,400
uh trying to understand how our brain

607
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
actually processes information

608
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
and get to how can we improve our

609
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,000
ability

610
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,600
to get to action and it turns out

611
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,960
that understanding here

612
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,520
is optional that we can actually get to

613
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,039
behavior change

614
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,880
without them truly understanding

615
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,400
what we're talking about now

616
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
you know a child we tell a child not to

617
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,520
do all kinds of things

618
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,000
they don't necessarily know all the

619
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
implications and all the rules and all

620
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,880
the things that are

621
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,159
there to protect them all we tell them

622
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:56,400
is

623
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,159
don't run out in traffic right

624
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,799
and we punish them and we we get them to

625
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,200
to

626
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,919
change their behavior without them truly

627
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,679
understanding all the ramifications

628
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,600
and there are a lot of other examples of

629
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,640
that most of the time our childhood

630
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,520
we're being taught a whole lot of rules

631
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,159
and

632
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,640
and and moral values and things like

633
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
that without truly understanding all the

634
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,919
consequences

635
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,720
and we've been operating that way for

636
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,640
100 000 years

637
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,120
so this actually works understanding it

638
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,000
turns out

639
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
while it's really valuable is

640
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,880
not required

641
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,360
in cyber security behavior change

642
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,159
is what we're after we really need

643
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:46,720
people

644
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
to to actually do the right thing they

645
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,240
may not understand it

646
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,760
but they have to be able to do the right

647
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
thing and so

648
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,840
now what we do is we have to go back and

649
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
reevaluate

650
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,039
well how do we optimize our

651
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,960
communication style for

652
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
behavior change well that's a long

653
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,240
discussion i don't

654
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,760
unfortunately think we have time to get

655
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,279
into that or to

656
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,760
to really cover that topic really well

657
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
now i will give you an idea that

658
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,039
one of the things that you could do is

659
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,520
reach out to a gentleman by the name of

660
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,400
b.j

661
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,039
fogg who used to run the persuasive

662
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,960
laboratory

663
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,720
persuasive technology laboratory at

664
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,240
stanford

665
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,760
and he talks about how we can change

666
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,440
people's behavior by using

667
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,320
a different approach and a different

668
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,679
timing

669
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,200
and so he his model is that when we're

670
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,559
trying to

671
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,360
try to motivate somebody to change we

672
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,559
have to

673
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,320
bring the right prompt at

674
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,360
at the right time and we need to make it

675
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
if it's if it's something that's really

676
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,919
um important we need to make it so that

677
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,720
it's easier to do

678
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,960
so uh this is a a an example where

679
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
he says that if under circum

680
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,080
certain circumstances giving people

681
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,600
props will fail

682
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,279
if it is either hard to do

683
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,039
um and the motivation is low

684
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,679
that's where we're we really need to

685
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,400
work

686
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,520
on either making it easier to do

687
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
or increasing the motivation to do it

688
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,039
because prompts alone

689
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,559
telling people to do it won't work

690
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,720
now you can look at a lot of his work

691
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,240
and i've interviewed him and some of the

692
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,480
interviews are actually on youtube

693
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,200
you can go to google sid chopra on

694
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,919
youtube and you should see some of these

695
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,360
so the question is what do we do well

696
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,400
we have to make it stupid simple

697
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,840
stupid simple

698
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,080
this is a gentleman by the name of steve

699
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,000
cooper steve cooper was the

700
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,679
cio of the us department of homeland

701
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,840
security he was special assistant to the

702
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,559
president

703
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,640
right after 9 11 then became the first

704
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,799
cio helped stand up the department of

705
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,159
homeland security

706
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,919
then he became the cio of the

707
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,240
u.s department of commerce and somewhere

708
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,320
in there he was the cio of the

709
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,320
of the faa

710
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,840
numerous number of numbers of

711
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,600
conversations with him

712
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,200
and whenever we talk about communication

713
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,960
he always says that we have to

714
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,600
make sure that people whenever they go

715
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
out from our organization

716
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,559
to business units or other organizations

717
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,200
that

718
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,399
they take time to understand

719
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,480
the the audience that they're speaking

720
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,440
to

721
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,840
their issues their problems their

722
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,799
challenges

723
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,399
and show how we're supporting them

724
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,080
in their mission we cannot dictate we

725
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,640
cannot

726
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,240
lecture them we cannot browbeat them

727
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,960
because we will not be able to get the

728
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,640
behavior change we want

729
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,120
and again you can see that in the

730
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,640
interview with uh steve cooper on

731
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,000
youtube as well

732
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,080
so what does brain friendly really look

733
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,279
like

734
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,240
well this is an example of a rework that

735
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
we did

736
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,559
using some people that were phd

737
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,600
candidates in

738
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,480
behavioral science and human factors to

739
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,360
try to make that

740
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,080
information more palatable to the way

741
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,640
the brain

742
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,679
processes information so in the first

743
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,559
few seconds

744
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,120
you can come away with something that

745
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,919
would

746
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,720
give you a grasp of what that document

747
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,039
is

748
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,080
explaining to you making it compelling

749
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,200
and at the same time informative so

750
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,799
that's that magic how do we make

751
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,840
something compelling

752
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,960
how do we make it informative and how do

753
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,120
we make it motivational

754
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,240
so this was just an example but we need

755
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,080
to re-evaluate

756
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,120
all the information that we're

757
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,720
presenting people to see does it

758
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,080
actually align

759
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,799
with the way the brain actually works

760
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,600
does it

761
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,880
actually make somebody want to read it

762
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,200
is does it pique their interest does it

763
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,399
grab their attention

764
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,640
does it give them a sense of trust

765
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
that it's that it's something that

766
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,240
they're going to find worthwhile to read

767
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,000
does it motivate them to act and lastly

768
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,720
is it memorable if we change their

769
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,480
behavior today

770
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,039
what's going to happen a week from now

771
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,480
when we're not there anymore

772
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,080
will they fall back in that same old

773
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,279
behavior that got him in trouble to

774
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,320
begin with

775
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,440
or here what happens then we can't

776
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
constantly be training them we need to

777
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,279
be able to do something

778
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,080
profoundly different than just lecturing

779
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,320
them

780
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,919
well how now how is that going to look

781
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,679
well it's going to be tough

782
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,240
and i'm not going to lie to you this is

783
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,679
going to take some investment

784
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,360
and we're going to have to spend a lot

785
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,520
more time trying to rethink the way that

786
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,240
we've been

787
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,039
working for quite some time and that

788
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,080
changes as

789
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
much as change is difficult for them

790
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,039
it's going to be difficult for us

791
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,880
because we've been indoctrinating one

792
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,159
approach and that

793
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,279
approach we've been able to show to show

794
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,200
scientifically

795
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,720
doesn't work so what i'm going to do is

796
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,240
i'm going to ask you

797
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,840
that your community our community

798
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,240
what can we do differently what can we

799
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,600
do differently

800
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,200
to actually optimize our

801
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,240
training and our education programs

802
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,039
so that we can actually achieve a

803
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,159
long-term

804
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,919
change in behavior how can we improve

805
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,120
the cyber hygiene of the workforce

806
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,880
and if we're not i mean if we try to

807
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,440
continue dumping this information to

808
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,120
them is just

809
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,279
going to confuse them and then they're

810
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,679
going to start turning off

811
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,240
and that's going to be a problem perhaps

812
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,679
maybe an issue for somebody else

813
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,519
but ultimately it will be an issue for

814
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,679
you

815
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,760
i want to ask you one favor everybody

816
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,960
pull out

817
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
open your wallet and pull out a twenty

818
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,080
dollar bill

819
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,120
a twenty dollar bill and if you look at

820
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,679
the back of the twenty dollar bill

821
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,279
it says the words in god

822
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,480
we trust because my late father you

823
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,399
would say

824
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,720
in god we trust but everybody else has

825
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
to pay cash

826
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,279
in our world the only people we're going

827
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,880
to trust is god

828
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,240
we shouldn't be trusting anybody else

829
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,840
but when we're trying to get people to

830
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,480
change your behavior

831
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,159
we need their trust we need their trust

832
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,200
we have to to work hard to win their

833
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,960
trust

834
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,559
because if we don't if we don't work

835
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,760
hard to gain their trust

836
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,440
well it's like ripping their money

837
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,159
tearing it up all their time their money

838
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,559
and their investment

839
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,600
and that may be okay for you to waste

840
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,679
their time

841
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,200
but somebody's paying the bill

842
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,399
and they're not going to be happy

843
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,640
and the question is if if we can

844
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,240
actually connect with

845
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,320
them in a way that's meaningful if we

846
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,159
can work with them instead of

847
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,440
lecturing them if we can get them to

848
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,480
open up and to be a partner in the

849
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,399
training

850
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,440
if we can inspire them instead of

851
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,120
lecturing them

852
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,439
why

853
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,919
we can do magic so i wanted to thank you

854
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,039
for all that

855
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,679
uh i i'm not as talented as some of the

856
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,880
other speakers

857
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,159
but i hope that we've been able to

858
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,399
spark your imagination to get you to

859
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,200
think

860
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,000
differently to invest your time and

861
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,799
efforts in

862
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,760
trying to do something magical and

863
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,559
realize

864
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,600
that the people that you're talking to

865
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,320
that we were

866
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,080
the people that were presenting to the

867
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,600
people that were trying to

868
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,480
change their behavior can actually be

869
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,440
partners

870
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,559
in creating this magic and in fact i

871
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,080
would say

872
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,760
they're the only ones that can create

873
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,360
the magic

874
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,480
all we have to do is inspire them

875
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,760
and get them to engage

876
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,039
you can follow me on here's my social

877
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,440
media

878
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,679
options and you can as i mentioned some

879
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,279
of these interviews and the

880
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,279
presentation i gave at the national

881
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,200
institute of standards and technology

882
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,679
is available on youtube thank you so

883
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,679
much for your time and i appreciate the

884
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,760
opportunity to speak to you

885
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,399
any questions

886
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,639
many companies today use fishing

887
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,800
exercises to encourage reporting

888
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,399
and provide education to their user

889
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,560
bases how do you address

890
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,960
a repeat offender or someone who doesn't

891
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,480
care about phishing exercises

892
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,079
how do you reach the people who don't

893
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,839
care about how their behavior affects

894
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,679
the company

895
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,119
well i think you're going to have to

896
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,040
explain to them the consequences

897
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,359
i think that most people once they

898
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,159
understand

899
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,440
that if the company

900
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,839
is hacked they lose their job

901
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,639
it oftentimes can can change some things

902
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,359
but there are also ways that you can use

903
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,560
social pressure

904
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,359
that their peer group can actually

905
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,320
encourage them

906
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,640
to do the right thing people are very

907
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,520
motivated by not wanting to stand out

908
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,240
negatively in their peer group it'd be

909
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,200
one thing if they

910
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,680
got if they caused something that

911
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,640
impacted them

912
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
but could you imagine what would happen

913
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,920
if their

914
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,000
whole company recognized that that's the

915
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,680
person that let the

916
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,240
the company get hacked and they're the

917
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
reason why

918
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,079
everybody lost their job that's pretty

919
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:24,640
much

920
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,560
pretty powerful motivator just a thought

921
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,760
now there may be a lot of other

922
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,320
approaches and i'm more than willing to

923
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,240
uh entertain them and i think we need to

924
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,160
do is start a dialogue

925
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,920
about these different approaches and

926
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,240
trying to understand

927
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,320
what would work best in what

928
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,440
circumstance

929
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,200
with what group what what audience

930
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,119
these are some things that take some

931
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,040
time and we we really do need to

932
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,640
to research well if i think of what

933
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,160
you're talking about i mean there's the

934
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,880
emotional human appeal to that approach

935
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,079
yes right yes yes and

936
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,760
and again uh we're we're not motivated

937
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,119
uh by logic it turns out

938
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,359
most of us remember we go back to that

939
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,240
that person in

940
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,359
caveman days when they were

941
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,920
hearing some rustling in the bushes the

942
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,520
ones that sat there and said i'm going

943
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,560
to get more data

944
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,720
to make a logical decision well they

945
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,560
were removed from the gene pool

946
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,480
we inherited the brain of the person

947
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,920
that said you know what i'm going to

948
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,359
jump to a conclusion

949
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,680
with incomplete data and get the hell

950
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,040
out of here

951
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,320
right so using that logical approach

952
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,599
while it may seem

953
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,119
perfectly rational presumes that we have

954
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,560
a rational brain

955
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,200
and we really don't our brain is not

956
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,680
based

957
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,880
on logic our decision making is not

958
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,839
based on logic let me rephrase that

959
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,079
super interesting science is cool

960
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,599
communication styles are

961
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,000
multi-generational

962
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
how does a company approach these

963
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,200
challenges while addressing behavior

964
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,480
change so i think that's interesting

965
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,119
right we

966
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,880
we were just talking about like human to

967
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
human but there's of course the fact

968
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,040
that

969
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,800
humans are different ages with different

970
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,480
predilections um

971
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,359
and also i mean this ties into the theme

972
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,160
of diversity

973
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,720
with folks understand things differently

974
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,320
based on their backgrounds and that can

975
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,839
be influenced by

976
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,839
gender race socioeconomic status

977
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,640
this kind of goes back to the idea of

978
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,040
lecturing to people

979
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
it turns out that the lecture the

980
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,800
definition of a lecture is is the

981
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,440
transference of information from the

982
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,640
uh the the the lecturers notes

983
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,800
to the listeners notes without going

984
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
through the minds of either

985
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,240
and that's not going to obviously work

986
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,079
what i've been experimenting with and

987
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,599
there's a gentleman by the name of dr

988
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,040
don norman who is a a thought leader in

989
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,640
something called human centered design

990
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,520
or human

991
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,200
community centered uh human design

992
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,359
and and what here's he's suggesting is

993
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,359
that we actually create communities

994
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,119
so we would create communities that

995
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,560
would create the content

996
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,960
we would create a guide much like you

997
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,480
know the national initiative the

998
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,440
national

999
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,960
institute of standards and technology

1000
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,920
has created the framework the nice

1001
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,760
framework well we would create

1002
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,520
communities around

1003
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,839
the nice framework that would create

1004
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
a specific version of that for

1005
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,280
their community and i think that might

1006
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,359
work better that what we have instead of

1007
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,119
expecting it to come up with all these

1008
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,079
different versions

1009
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,480
we partner up with the different user

1010
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,000
communities and say hey listen this

1011
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,680
is the basic guidance that we have

1012
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,359
created can you help us

1013
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,800
tailor this guidance to your user group

1014
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
with your user community

1015
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,320
to get them to create means that they

1016
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,200
have

1017
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,000
created buy-in and they have that

1018
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,760
credibility that trust that we talked

1019
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,160
about

1020
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,599
earlier to their community

1021
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,760
so that's my approach that's how i would

1022
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,000
do it

1023
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,960
absolutely i mean going to them using

1024
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,839
their

1025
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,720
words trying to you know trying to show

1026
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,160
at least that you're making

1027
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,839
like wanting to bridge that gap i think

1028
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,280
helps too you know just seeing like um

1029
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,920
goes back to uh the old adage like when

1030
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,880
you travel to

1031
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,079
a country that speaks a different

1032
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,079
language like making some sort of effort

1033
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:34,720
to at least

1034
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,880
say hello do you speak english in their

1035
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,240
native language like it

1036
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
you know it has a completely different

1037
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,079
um a completely different outcome

1038
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,760
most of the time than just walking up

1039
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,200
and assuming that everyone speaks

1040
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,160
english right

1041
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,480
um so it it's it's an interesting

1042
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,720
concept and it makes sense

1043
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,640
and the parallels are all around us if

1044
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,720
we just open our eyes to those

1045
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,400
uh you know that example that you said

1046
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
when we go to another culture

1047
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,440
is so true it's so true and it and we

1048
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,960
just don't think about that when

1049
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,599
we're in an organization that when we go

1050
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,160
to

1051
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,880
accounting or if we go to uh marketing

1052
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,200
or some other business unit

1053
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,480
that we they are actually experts in

1054
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,240
their world but their world is

1055
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,319
significantly different than ours the

1056
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,760
way they look at things the way they

1057
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,520
approach things is significantly

1058
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,240
different

1059
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,720
and that if we try to lecture them or if

1060
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,839
we try to talk to them

1061
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,079
the way that we would talk to people in

1062
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,160
our own community

1063
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,760
too often it's going to fall on deaf

1064
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,240
ears and if we try to be forceful

1065
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,000
they're going to be they're you're going

1066
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,160
to burn a bridge

1067
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,359
know your audience

1068
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,440
exactly well not only knowing your

1069
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,920
audience but tailor your message to that

1070
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,880
audience

1071
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,400
yes it's not enough to know you're going

1072
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,880
to actually take that message you can't

1073
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,640
tell a a

1074
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,040
a child that his goldfish died by

1075
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,240
lecturing

1076
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,400
your your your particular brand of

1077
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,520
whatever

1078
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,240
latin name of your goldfish has deceased

1079
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,920
and is no longer with us

1080
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,680
we've summarily flushed it down the

1081
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,520
toilet it will now join the sewage

1082
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,720
system

1083
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
and be cleansed by the municipality i

1084
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,640
mean you can't do that to a child

1085
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,440
yes yeah i don't have goldfish

1086
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
