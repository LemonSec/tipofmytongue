00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,720
a lot of hacking and infosec

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,560
conferences i think i've organized more

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,159
than 200 or

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,479
nearly 300 ones around the entire

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,439
country it was a lot of events

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,759
and because of that i got to know a lot

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,720
of people

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,799
from the hacking scene in the infosec

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,840
scene as well

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,799
from brazil so i became a community

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,759
manager as well

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,400
and i was also the leader of a huge

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
volunteer team with more than a thousand

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,399
and five hundred people

39
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,940
uh so it was fun

40
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,520
[Laughter]

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,240
uh and because all of that i had uh you

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,280
know i had

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
close contact with a lot of people uh

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
giving to talks and

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,119
you know creating the content that would

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,600
go and uh be presented on this

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
conferences

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,920
uh and all the communities and you know

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
so i got to learn about social

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
engineering so

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
i already had all this you know human

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,440
abilities in me

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
because of journalism because of

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
community management

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,440
uh because of events organizing and then

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,840
um

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,080
i was already in love with hacking i

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,760
will tell a little bit about that

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,800
in just a few seconds but uh

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
to me that love really expanded

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,800
uh when my when one of the people that

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,720
i've met in an event i think y'all may

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,160
know mark rogers

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,840
he told me that um hacking was supposed

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,040
to be

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,280
uh whatever you wanted it to be in your

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,239
own life

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
uh so if you you know if you have it as

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,879
a lifestyle as if you have it as a

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,160
if if you have it as a mentality uh you

71
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
should be calling yourself a hacker

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
and that's when i was like okay then i

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
guess i'm a hacker now because i really

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,879
enjoyed social engineering i really

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,319
liked the subject and i was

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,879
i was i started to studying uh quite a

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,000
bit

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,360
and from there i went to awareness uh

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,480
campaigns i i you know built a lot of uh

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920

hacker manifesto i took a very long

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
while to get to know it but once i

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,720
i took a gander at it this part right

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,360
here just

116
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
spoke very loudly to me and you gotta

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,240
you gotta i'm not technical at all so

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
you gotta think like

119
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,639
when uh i was journalist i was a content

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,560
producer community manager i was

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,120
you know um already struggling with the

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,400
hacker word

123
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,440
and this just came very strongly to me i

124
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
just uh you know read the manifesto and

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,919
i was like

126
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,160
that is it this is social engineering

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,360
this is what i like

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
this is what i want this is what i want

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120

172
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,560
heavy books

173
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,880
uh yeah maybe probably yes

174
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
so yes uh search engineer uh if you

175
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
don't know what a social engineer

176
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,000
is it's you know it's a we also call a

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
social engineer a human hacker

178
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,199
uh we go for the human error so we are

179
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,360
there to take advantage of people making

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,080
mistakes

181
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,120
or inducing them to make mistakes

182
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
so we can take take advantage of that

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
so you know as a lot of people talk

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,639
about you know the human hair

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,520
as we you know we lay around and expect

186
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,199
someone to make a mistake

187
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,560
but a lot of us actually are

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,599
the source of that mistake as well

189
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,479
so you can call it like a manipulation

190
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,360
techniques

191
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,120
i don't kind of like that uh description

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,280
but i guess it is what it is this is

193
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,120
easy for people to understand so

194
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
uh we go to you know uh psychology and

195
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
sociology and behavior analysis

196
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,599
to explore the human responses you know

197
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,479
to explore

198
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,680
the commands that people will uh respond

199
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,319
to

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,280
uh therefore we study the human behavior

201
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,680
to

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
better approach people so we can have

203
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,160
access to stuff we shouldn't

204
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
uh and that's what i do i started doing

205
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,240
uh physical pen tests a few a few years

206
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
ago like four or five years ago i don't

207
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,319
remember

208
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
i don't remember anymore uh but it was

209
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,960
out of nowhere a friend of mine that

210
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,759
was uh you know building this social uh

211
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,520
social engineering awareness

212
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,639
platform uh got this really big client

213
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,160
and the client went on a physical pen

214
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
test and this poor friend of mine he was

215
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,919
also very overworked

216
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,960
and not at all a people's person

217
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,720
there was a reason why he was working

218
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,080
with a computer

219
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,120
uh so he asked for help and

220
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
knowing that i was really good with

221
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,240
people because of all the

222
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,120
events and community management uh i

223
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,000
went there with

224
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
my first with the client and i helped

225
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,199
him in a physical

226
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,520
uh you know assessment uh in a physical

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,799
pen test

228
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,559
and it was just a blast the client was

229
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,640
very happy at the end i was very happy

230
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
at the end the company was very

231
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
happy at the end at the end it was

232
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,200
everyone was like

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,480
super uh super um excited uh

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,320
because i did a bunch of crazy stuff it

235
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,560
was my first assignment i had never done

236
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,120
or

237
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,839
uh read about or studied or even though

238
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,240
it

239
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,440
existed you know physical pen testing so

240
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,519
i did a bunch of stuff that you're not

241
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,760
supposed to do when you're you know

242
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,480
doing it day to day not because it was

243
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,920
against uh you know

244
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,760
ethics it was nothing unethical but

245
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,959
because it was dangerous for myself

246
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,040
and nowadays i don't do a bunch of that

247
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,640
stuff that i should have no i should not

248
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
have done

249
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,360
uh so i got a few techniques here that i

250
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,399
usually use

251
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,000
use a lot in the physical pen test that

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,480
i

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,440
used to do in back in brazil i'm not

254
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,560
doing it since the pandemic of course

255
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,920
but i used to do a lot of tailgating

256
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
a lot of tailgating you cannot believe

257
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,959
the places you can get with just

258
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,920
tailgating

259
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,720
i mean it is i know it's very obvious i

260
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
know we've been talking about this for

261
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,160
ages now

262
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
but just just to illustrate here i

263
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
got uh one of my my most

264
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,760
like uh paranoid clients

265
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,800
they gave me a lot of warnings like um

266
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
it was one of my what am i i think it

267
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
was my second or third client i can't

268
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,519
even remember but it was

269
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
way in the beginning uh and they were

270
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,640
very very you know

271
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,200
high alert like uh we're gonna have uh

272
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,680
the

273
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,160
president of the company it's gonna be

274
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,519
in the build he's gonna be in the

275
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,160
building

276
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,360
and he's has a lot of uh personal guards

277
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,000
with them

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,079
and we cannot control of the what that

279
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,360
guards are gonna do

280
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,760
so you gotta be very careful and we got

281
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,519
a bunch of stuff in place

282
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,560
like cameras all around the building and

283
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,600
uh you know access and whatever access

284
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,160
points

285
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,519
uh controls and whatever and the client

286
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,360
just gave me like

287
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,399
all of this uh you know

288
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,680
scary talk and i was like damn

289
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,200
i don't i don't know where i'm going i

290
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,560
don't know where i'm getting into i'm

291
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,279
kind of

292
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,680
kind of you know scared for myself but i

293
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,720
went anyway

294
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
and this was a client that took me 10

295
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
minutes to sit on the president's chair

296
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,200
and it was 100 tailgating y'all from the

297
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,240
street

298
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,800
uh to you all the way to the building it

299
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
was a hundred percent tailgating i

300
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,680
i came from the street as a complete

301
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,399
stranger

302
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,279
i did not had a clone badge the client

303
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,360
didn't paid me to do any

304
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,560
recon so i had you know i barely even

305
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
looked at the

306
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,680
the maps and all i just did google maps

307
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,480
it was very very like unprepared the

308
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,920
client didn't give me any

309
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,120
any like time uh it was kind of a blind

310
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,760
test

311
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,240
almost uh it wasn't a blind house

312
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,959
because

313
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,360
a hundred percent of blind has because i

314
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,000
already knew

315
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,880
someone from the building uh but it was

316
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,480
almost there

317
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
and i went from the street uh inside the

318
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
parking lot and there was you know this

319
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,120
big gate

320
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,360
that people would badge in and i just

321
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
waited for someone imagine and i

322
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
you know tailgating the tailgate at the

323
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
gate uh

324
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,519
and once i was inside the parking lot i

325
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,399
did had

326
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,600
a of a fake badge

327
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,160
i just went on you know google and typed

328
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
the name of the company plus badge and i

329
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,040
found

330
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,560
um a provider

331
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
actually this company did not had a lot

332
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,839
of people uh you know

333
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,720
posting pages on social media but the

334
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,880
provider the person who the the company

335
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,920
that did

336
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,600
the badges for them they posted it

337
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,639
and that's how i got the fake badge so

338
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,680
i you know printed a fake badge

339
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,959

379
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,360
minutes of me just pretending i was

380
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,279

you know rooftop uh floor and it took

386
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,800
me a couple of minutes to find out where

387
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,199
the

388
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,160

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,480
like aquarium kind of room

390
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,000
uh and i just it was empty

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,639
pretty much almost no one in the floor i

392
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,600
just walked in

393
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,160
the room and i was like okay i guess i'm

394
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,399
gonna sit in the director's chair

395
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,279
and i did all this stuff on the table

396
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,199
you know i took a few pictures and all

397
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,000
and send the videos to the security uh

398
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,320
team that had hired me and this security

399
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,440
team was like what

400
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,160
had is it's been like 15 minutes since

401
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,199
you started

402
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,760
and i'm like well yeah i'm already

403
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,680
sitting in the president's chair

404
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,519
they were like oh my what what what have

405
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,519
you done to go there like

406
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,800
i tailgated like three doors and i'm

407
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,480
here

408
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,000
and that was it so yeah tailgating

409
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,199
very bad very very bad uh still

410
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,320
still works wonders uh

411
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,440
services entries or stairs as i said you

412
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,760
know just gave you this example most of

413
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,560
them have

414
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,720
absolutely no cameras no one watching

415
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,639
uh in brazil also

416
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,360
very few of them have any uh access

417
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,480
control like

418
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,839
badges or biometry or anything very few

419
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,360
of them have that so if you

420
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,199
get to the surface entries or stairs

421
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,199
you're in and you may be

422
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,880
sitting on the president's chair in just

423
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,240
a couple minutes

424
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,279
um so fake reception email this one is

425
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,360
also one that it sounds

426
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,000
pretty obvious but it works wonders as

427
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,120
well

428
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,639
what i do is i walk up to the reception

429
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,079
and usually the reception uh give you

430
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,839
they just give you the email of the

431
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,120
reception

432
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,360
if they don't uh you may find it in the

433
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,399
in the website of the company and

434
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,040
if you don't um some of the receptions

435
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,600
have

436
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,800
the email printed in like

437
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,959
on a on a you know on the wall or

438
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,240
something

439
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,279
uh and if none of those those cases uh

440
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,519
are true you can just insist for one or

441
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
two minutes with the set with the sob

442

more than more than i can count actually

509
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
i can't count how many

510
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,440
times i've used this technique to get

511
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,520
inside and it worked

512
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,200
so yeah a fake badge

513
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,559
we all know this trick right you go for

514
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,120
either social media or you go

515
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,919
mainly social media or google just you

516
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,440
know google in general

517
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,280
and you type the name of the company

518
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
plus badge or

519
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,280
you just hashtag name of the company or

520
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,120
hashtag badge

521
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,640
and you can find a lot of badges i have

522
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
this you know very filled

523
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,200
this this folder on my computer

524
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
filled with pictures not actually a

525
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,000
folder in my computer but let's say a

526
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,440
photo in my computer

527
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,160
filled filled with pictures and prints

528
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,679
that i take from people on

529
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,440
linkedin for example that every time

530
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,360
they get a new job they post a badge

531
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,160
there

532
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,800
so i have a lot just in case i need

533
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,360
[Laughter]

534
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,320
so i put here ocean because sometimes

535
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,360
the company

536
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,120
do have a uh you know a policy against

537
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,080
posting their badges online but there's

538
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,520
always someone

539
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,799
that don't obey that and if you if they

540
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,600
do

541
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,480
i already told you a case where the the

542
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,320
provider the company that actually

543
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,440
did that produced the the badges

544
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,240
was the weakest link and they posted it

545
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,960
and i got

546
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,320
i got it from them and it was not hard

547
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,960
to find

548
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,400
it was like on page two on google so you

549
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,039
know

550
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,840
not they they have the no badge policy

551
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
but probably there's no one checking if

552
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,320
there's

553
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,600
actually people posting it or not

554
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,799
uh and you know from social engineering

555
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,559
you can um usually what we what you can

556
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,200
do for

557
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,960
the fake email example that i gave you

558
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,280
you know creating a conflict uh or

559
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
creating a problem and

560
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,360
you know almost immediately solving that

561
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,039
problem for the person

562
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,520
so oh i know you know i'm gonna have to

563
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,640
do this thing but

564
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,720
uh you're gonna have to do this huge

565
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
thing for me but don't worry

566
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,240
i have this other thing for you that you

567
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,640
will it will make it easier

568
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,840
uh so yes

569
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
usually the fake email is a good one

570
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,159
like you you get very agitated with the

571
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,440
reception

572
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,159
they you know people feel what you feel

573
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,360
most of the times

574
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,600
there is always a very good level of

575
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,960
empathy going on

576
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,760
uh with human to human no matter how

577
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,840
empathetic you are there's always some

578
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
basic level unless you're

579
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,360
you know a psychopath or a sociopath

580
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,120
sociopath but

581
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,840
usually it works pretty fine if you

582
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,480
rattle them if you get them hyped

583
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,559
they will feel like oh my god i didn't

584
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,720
have this task before oh my oh my god i

585
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
didn't have this problem before

586
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,760
but if you take a deep breath and

587
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,200
talk to the person look at the person

588
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,880
you know what

589
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,360
don't worry i'm not gonna burn burden

590
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,039
you with this

591
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,640
i am i'm gonna work a miracle

592
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,679
i i got this i got you don't worry just

593
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,520
you know give me give me the access to

594
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,559
the wi-fi

595
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,760
and in like 10 minutes 15 minutes

596
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
maybe 20 tops i can solve that

597
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,600
and you won't have to to worry with that

598
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,720
there you go

599
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,640
you have the you have the password that

600
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,799
you needed or you had the access that

601
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,400
you needed

602
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,440
um this it would that was a

603
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,600
real example um

604
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,640
you can also you should also uh

605
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,120
improv i know a lot of people say don't

606
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,039
improv do your homework

607
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,720
yes do your homework do don't you ever

608
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,039
go

609
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,360
to an assignment don't you ever go to a

610
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,159
mission

611
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,120
without your homework well done your

612
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,080
research

613
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,520
you know all of your recon if you can uh

614
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,360
but ultimately stuff that you don't

615
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,720
predict will happen especially in brazil

616
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,200
that is a poor country and nothing works

617
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,400
the way you should

618
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,200
someone is always out sick and you

619
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
didn't predicted it

620
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,440
or there is like construction or it's

621
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,000
there's

622
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,159
always something insane going on

623
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,200
uh back in brazil and in the middle of

624
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,000
the day and you

625
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,159
never expected it so you gotta be very

626
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,039
very good with the

627
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,679
with the with with your improv a very

628
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,760
good example here

629
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,840
is um i was in this client

630
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,960
it was a very huge media client

631
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,240
uh like a like a television thing

632
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,280
and i was supposed to get uh

633
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,039
access to their internal

634
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,919
like um intranet inter internet is that

635
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,799
the name

636
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,559
like the internal system that people use

637
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,720
to communicate and put up tasks and all

638
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,000
of that

639
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,240
uh and i was supposed to get access to

640
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,120
that

641
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,880
i was like oh my god how am i gonna get

642
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
access to that and

643
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,360
so i went uh for the help desk

644
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,400
department

645
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,039
on lunch time lunchtime is usually when

646
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,400
everyone leaves

647
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,279
uh you know the the intern behind or

648
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,159
someone that

649
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,159
you know is in debt with the world

650
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,120
so the person stayed behind on lunchtime

651
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,520
or is someone like overworking they

652
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,840
gotta rush through a deadline

653
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,520
so it's usually not someone that's

654
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,440
prepared to deal with anything extra

655
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
during lunch time

656
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,360
and that's when you wanna attack and

657
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,559
i found that person i found this

658
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,039
this dude that was left behind on the

659
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,799
desk on the help desk

660
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,919
department and i told him you know

661
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,000
oh i have i'm here from another state

662
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,919
and the you know the big company sent me

663
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,400
sent me here to check on something

664
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,039
that's

665
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,320
uh wrong on the system it's been

666
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,840
on like it's it's an alert that has been

667
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,640
beeping us

668
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,120
for a few weeks already and we finally

669
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,159

670
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320

671
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,520
here to check it

672
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,080
so yeah sorry for the delay but we're

673
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,240
here and we're here to fix it

674
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,279
and the dude was not

675
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,799
entirely having it i felt like

676
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,080
he was 60 there i was like

677
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,159
oh my god and i have to be quick because

678
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,240
i had already two missions that i had to

679
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
do on lunchtime as well

680
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,679
so i didn't have much time with that

681
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,159
view i needed him to just buy whatever i

682
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,320
said

683
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,480
i was like okay i'm gonna have to improv

684
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,600
on this one

685
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,960
uh and i started walking

686
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,480
uh you know um walking

687
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,520
in circles very worried i'm like

688
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,000
uh do you know where the nearest airport

689
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,039
is because i've

690
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,440
i've just now noticed that my airplane

691
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,080
is gonna

692
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,039
fly uh two three hours from now three

693
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,159
hours from now

694
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,200
and i have to you know get this thing

695
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,000
ready and

696
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,919
go to the other department and get

697
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,200
another thing ready

698
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
and i'm just not sure if i can make it

699
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,919
and i gave a very small window of time

700
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:08,880
on purpose

701
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,120
because i knew the airport was really

702
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,279
far i would never make there in three

703
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:13,720
hours

704
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,440
[Laughter]

705
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000

that i i really need to fix this like

711
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,360

712
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,840
for the company to send someone here and

713
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960

719
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,440

720
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,120
of the department but it was right in

721
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,679

and he locked in on my machine and he

729
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,400
was

730
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,039
the cis admin of the internal system

731
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,720

732
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,559
discussing the best routes for me to

733
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,200

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,399
because i had already tried this before

747
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,320
and it almost worked so i was gonna try

748
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,399
to do this again and it worked and the

749
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,240

754
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
but i'll be right back

755
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,799

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,480
thank you so much for coming here in my

757
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,880
aid

758
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
and i just grabbed my computer and ran

759
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
uh and the

760
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
the session was saved on my computer so

761
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
i could do whatever i wanted in the

762
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,799
internal systems

763
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,039
so yeah improv you gotta be able to

764
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,080
to find your own jewels and just roll

765
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,520
with it

766
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,600
uh a bunch of things is just simply

767
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,799
asking

768
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,399
a lot of people think of this like huge

769
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,840
uh plans and all of that and most of the

770
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,520
times you just

771
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,320
you just ask a lot of the times back in

772
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,279
brazil this is

773
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,440
this is very scary but a lot of times

774
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,360
back in brazil if i just stand

775
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,200
in front of a door that has like a

776
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,640
password or

777
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,480
badge reading or something like that if

778
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
i stand there long enough

779
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,799
someone will come and open that door for

780
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,080
me without me asking

781
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,520
i swear this is not a lie

782
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,559
it happened like five times already if i

783
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,360
stay there

784
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,919
long enough and doing like this and and

785
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:16,640
like this

786
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,840
and looking at my phone and

787
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,279
worrying myself there you go someone

788
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,399
comes in and opens the door for you

789
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,480
and the last one i love this one i'm

790
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,440
gonna try to run

791
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,279
through the stories here i'm usually

792
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,559
gonna take this long

793
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,720
with this talk but since it's in english

794
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,240
i didn't calculate in my time right i

795
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,799
guess

796
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,880
but i'm just gonna rush through but this

797
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,000
one i really want to say

798
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,159
the the this someone called it because

799
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,559
it's the one that i have most fun with

800
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,440
uh which is you just knocked on you just

801
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,200
knock on someone's door

802
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,399
and ask if someone called i.t

803
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,600
and everyone in the entire planet

804
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,279
at any given time has called i.t

805
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,159
for some you know weird reason for some

806
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,520
very dumb reason

807
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,159
uh so if you knock on their door and you

808
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,159
can even ask like is the internet kind

809
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,640
of slow here today

810
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,559
it's like it's gonna rain computers on

811
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,760
you

812
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,360
especially in brazil i had this mission

813
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,159
uh once that it was i had to break into

814
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:20,960
the

815
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,120
monitoring room where all you know the

816
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,080
video camera

817
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,640
the the feed from the security cameras

818
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,159
were

819
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,760
and uh it was a very hard

820
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,480
room to find it took me quite a while to

821
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,039
find

822
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,320
where the room was uh but i did

823
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,679
and it was this giant like iron door

824
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,799
uh you know very solid door with the pad

825
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,200
with

826
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,399
cameras on both sides with you know a

827
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,000
vacuum chamber in the middle

828
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,039
it was it was a hard place to get in

829
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,679
so i what i did was like i don't see any

830
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,080
very

831
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,880
very smart way to get into here and

832
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,720
except like knocking on the door and

833
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,000
hey just someone called it

834
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,720
i did it it worked i got in

835
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,799
the the monitoring the security

836
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,240
monitoring room

837
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,679
and the people that were it was a

838
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,159
security guard and cheer ladies

839
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,360
i don't think the two ladies were

840
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,080
supposed to be there but they were there

841
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,880
um and i was just started like plugging

842
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,679
my usb

843
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,880

just have your fun with it so yes

882
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,960
stealing um i see a lot of stuff from

883
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
meeting rooms meeting rooms that are

884
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,960
unlocked are easy to find or they have

885
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,320
the whole schedule

886
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,799
on the door i love that because that

887
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,320
means i know when the

888
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,919
meeting room is free is unused so i can

889
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,000
walk inside a meeting room and i have an

890
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,919
entire meeting room for myself and that

891
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:10,559
gives me

892
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,039
a lot of credibility i use that to steal

893
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,320
information from

894
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,159

information

cabinets

924
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,719
with the key on the hole

hole you know

927

like right on the wall

929
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,639

unlocked devices especially turning the

946

combine

963
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,800
those to your assignment even if you're

964
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,320
our own field

965
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
this is really helpful if you need

966
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,800
someone to open a door for you

967
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,960
uh or if you need to someone give you

968
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,800
access to somewhere and you

969
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,880
you need a password to a lab or

970
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,119
something you combine those

971
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,920
you you get to know that person's number

972
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,520
it's not that hard if you know where

973
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,280
they sit they usually have

974
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,599
uh you know cards or if their

975
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,520
information is lying around so you can

976
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,000
combine

977
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,400
attacks while you are on the field or

978
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,000
even before

979
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,560
uh about usb so as you see on the

980
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,400
example that i gave

981
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,440
you know earlier bad usbs are really fun

982
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,599
to have with you

983
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,000
i don't know if i'm like i'm over my

984
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,920
time or not please here in the chat if

986
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,640
just let me know i'm just gonna keep

talking

988
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,960
um

989
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,960
and there you go uh for manipulation

990
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,359
techniques i don't like that word but

991
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,720
i'm gonna call it like that

992
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,920
or uh for uh human behavior

993
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,599
um you know assertiveness

994
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,119
i don't know how to say this in english

995
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,200
but for human behavior

996
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,560
molding and whatever you can call it

997
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,599
manipulation

998
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,720
finally you're causing human error so

999
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,200
yes you have to have a very good report

1000
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,960
building technique

1001
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,160
you can either you know make the person

1002
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,520
feel very close to you

1003
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,400
super quick or make the person feel uh

1004
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,880
safe

1005
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,000
if you're around make the person feel

1006
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,880
happy you know tell them a joke or be

1007
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,359
nice or just be very kind and gentle

1008
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,160
it's something that

1009
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,320
most people are not used to their day is

1010
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,599
going bad

1011
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,520
they're stressed they have stuff to do

1012
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
so if you're nice

1013

people will help you way faster there's

1014
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,320
a lot of people that ask me

1015
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,400
in my talks in like in social media

1016
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,680
media in general

1017
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,320
if i'm like pointing a gun to people or

1018
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,800
if i'm

1019
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,960
threatening them oh you should like you

1020
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
you're good at ocean so you're gonna

1021
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,119
get to know like all their dirt and

1022
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,560
you're you know they're gonna do

1023
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,920
everything you want like

1024
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,160
don't don't please don't do that that's

1025
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,680
that's a very bad

1026
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,040
uh way to build rapport that's no report

1027
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,920
at all

1028
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,480
um you don't wanna do that because the

1029
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,160
negative effect

1030
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,800
lasts way longer and brings you way more

1031
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,520
risk

1032
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,800
than the gentler and kinder and nicer

1033
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,839
and nicer and happiest approach because

1034
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:28,240
people

1035
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,560
like to be happy and just in life you

1036
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,079
can see this

1037
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,119
you remember uh all the bad stuff

1038
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,920
right you remember them way easier you

1039
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,280
criticize yourself

1040
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,599
harshly you forget to you know

1041
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,920
um celebrate the little things in your

1042
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,800
life the little

1043
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,359
the little conquests uh the little

1044
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,400
victories

1045
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,560
and they fall forgotten if something

1046
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,480
goes wrong on your day because it's

1047
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,680
frustrating

1048
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,880
because infuriating and something can

1049
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,000
pretty much ruin your entire good day if

1050
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,040
they're

1051
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,599
bad enough which is not much for you

1052
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,599
know the regular person

1053
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,800
so because of that you want the good

1054
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,320
feeling if even if you hype them if you

1055
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,839
hype your target

1056
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,359
you want them to feel good at the end so

1057
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,560
you know what i got you i'm gonna solve

1058
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,119
this

1059
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,920
and you know you're gonna help me you're

1060
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,280
gonna make this thing

1061
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,000
work we're gonna make this thing work

1062
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,119
and there you go

1063
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,960
you you built a very good report um

1064
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,040
and divide and conquer lunchtime and

1065
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,880
after our hours i kind of talked this

1066
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,079
about be a

1067
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,480
i kind of talked about this before uh

1068
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,240
you want people that are

1069
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,040
uh you know by themselves or almost by

1070
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,560
themselves you don't want about a bunch

1071
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,280
of people

1072
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,079
a lot of people can raise a lot of flags

1073
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,760
uh you want as

1074
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,320
less people as possible you want to go

1075
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,240
and therefore you want to find them at

1076
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,200
lunchtime or

1077
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,079
after hours i do a lot of crazy stuff

1078
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,640
during after hours i steal all

1079
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,119
all the kinds of things you can imagine

1080
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,560
i have stolen

1081
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,240
medical exams and you know blueprints

1082
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,280
from the director's department from you

1083
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
know from after hours

1084
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,000
and it's pretty pretty much anything you

1085
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,920
can touch inside of the company without

1086
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,560
raising any alarms

1087
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,040
um so you gotta build credibility

1088
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,200
credibility is super important

1089
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,640
um it is what will give you

1090
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,000
most of the accesses so either you was

1091
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,240
if you if you're a support if you are tr

1092
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
if you're a trainee

1093
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,800
uh i do that a lot because i'm a a white

1094
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
girl a white little girl

1095
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,200
so people tend to not give me enough

1096
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,240
credit i

1097
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,040
i usually can't uh you know barge in

1098
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
giving orders

1099
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,599
because that would make me a bee people

1100
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,800
don't like bossy women

1101
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,240
and um they usually just don't take me

1102
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,200
seriously

1103
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,240
and because of that i take advantage

1104
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,839
of you know support or trainee or junior

1105
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,800
or someone that needs help or someone

1106
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,560
that indeed in a support

1107
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,359
uh supporting role i'm there to help

1108
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,440
them

1109
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,160
and not to boss them around uh but it

1110
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,000
all depends on your profile of course

1111
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
on you know how tall you are your skin

1112
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,720
color your voice tone everything

1113
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,599
i have this you know this voice tone in

1114
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,839
english but my voice is my voice changes

1115
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:34,880
completely

1116
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,800
you have to be able to do that with your

1117
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,640
tone with your rhythm

1118
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,480
you got to be able to you know build

1119
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,160
your your character you

1120
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,800
you do your pre-texting pretty good uh

1121
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,760
so

1122
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,440
usually when i'm talking to people i'm

1123
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,119
like super cute

1124
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,000
and you know that kind of makes them

1125
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,480
feel

1126
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,599
more um connected to me

1127
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,440

1129
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,599
