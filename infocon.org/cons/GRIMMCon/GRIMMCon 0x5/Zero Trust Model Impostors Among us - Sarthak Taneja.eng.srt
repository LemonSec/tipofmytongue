1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,360
so

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,079
hey everyone good morning today i will

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,760
be presenting on the topic

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,240
among us the zero trust model and we

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
will be discussing about the

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
imposters that stay between our network

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,920
and hide in plain sight first

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
a little about me my name is salthek

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,880
and i'm working as an information

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,320
security engineer

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,200
at a fintech corporation you can find me

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,559
at twitter and discord

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,719
so a little bit introduction about zero

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,320
trust model

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
initially zero trust was created by john

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,920
kendall

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
during his realization that the

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,680
traditional security models

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,039
operate on a like outdated assumption

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
that everything inside an organization's

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,440
network should be trusted

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,559
but under this broken trust model

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,360
it is assumed that our users identity is

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,640
not compromised

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,200
and that all users act responsibly and

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,960
can be trusted

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
the zero trust model recognizes that

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,479
trust is a vulnerability

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,960
once on the network users including

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,360
threat actors and malicious insiders

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,000
are free to move laterally and access or

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
exfiltrate whatever data

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,960
they are not limited to remember one

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,079
thing the point of

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,640
infiltration of an attack is often the

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
not the target location

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,479
they move laterally and get to the

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,119
target location

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,000
buy a zero trust model is needed with

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,479
them

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,720
as we can see with the modern workforce

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,200
of becoming increasingly on the go

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
accessing applications from multiple

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
devices outside of the business

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,079
parameter

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,479
enterprises have adopted a verify then

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,759
trust model

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,799
they verify explicitly which means if

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,719
someone has the correct user

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,119
credentials they are admitted to

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,240
whichever site

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
application or device they are

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
requesting

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
this resulted in an increased risk of

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,479
exposure

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,400
dissolving what was once trusted

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,239
enterprise zone of control

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,560
and leaving many organizations exposed

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
to data breaches

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,800
malware and as we all can see ransomware

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,760
tanks

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,080
protection is now needed where

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
applications and data end users and

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,720
devices are located

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,280
to be competitive businesses need a zero

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
trust network architecture

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,920
able to protect the enterprise data

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
wherever users and devices

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,599
are but meantime also ensuring that

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,440
applications work quickly and seamlessly

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,000
all i came across by the searching about

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,040
zero trust model

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
and this is the perfect definition of

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
zero trust that zero trust is not about

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,200
making a system trusted

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,159
but instead it is all about eliminating

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,920
the trust factor from the organization

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,640
uh when we talk about imposters there

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,040
are mainly three categories of imposters

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,800
which can be insider threats

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
devices and applications insider threats

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
can be both granted and site controlled

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,680
employees

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,239
rental employees can be the employees

85
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,360
which are fired

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,599
or which led the organization and now

87
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,040
have malicious

88
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,159
intent against the organization but side

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,760
granted employees can be

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,599
which are like angry from

91
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,680
angry from management or just

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,959
experimenting so

93
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
for example not all insider thirds have

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,840
the malicious intent

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
i can share one example i have been

96
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,000
through like uh

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,959
during my last job i was testing an uh

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,480
land survey on my device

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,000
and like my intent was pure and i was

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,799
tuning an

101
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,000
idiot but it went wrong and the

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,120
my machine was compromised so insider

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,519
threads can be of this type also so zero

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:01,920
trust

105
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,959
must be there to not have any

106
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,080
mishappening on the network devices can

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,720
be both

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,439
trusting and infected same as

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,519
applications can be both trusted and

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,319
compromised

111
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,120
and the like there can be a spy we're

112
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
hiding in our

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
network and we get to know about it like

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
after two or three years we have seen

115
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,759
the

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,840
uh these kind of attacks in recent

117
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,800
supply chain returns

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,320
then we come to secure access services

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,440
model which is mainly a sassy model

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,600
before diving into the specific

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
specifics of sassy

122
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,360
it's important to understand a bit of

123
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
background on this new term

124
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
existing network approaches and

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,880
technologies

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
simply no longer provide the levels of

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,919
security

128
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,960
and access control digital organizations

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,840
need

130
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,360
these organizations demand immediate

131
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,120
uninterrupted access for their users

132
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,840
no matter where they are located as we

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,039
can see

134
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,960
with an increase in remote users and

135
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,199
software as a service applications

136
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
data moving from one data center to

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,400
cloud services

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,960
and more traffic going to public cloud

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
services and branch offices

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
then talk to data center the need for a

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
new approach for network security has

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
risen

143
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,120
so what do we mean by assassins

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,360
basically an emerging cyber security

145
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
concept that gartner described in

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,199
august 2019 report the future of network

147
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,039
security in the cloud

148
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,000
with so many similar terms and acronyms

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
floating around

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
it's important to make sure you

151
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
understand what our vendor is actually

152
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,400
talking about

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
when you are discussing the solutions of

154
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
the network

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
the concept of zero trust came about

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,199
because the old network security model

157
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,520
of inside means trusted and outside

158
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
means untrusted no longer works

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,440
the zero trust model moves security away

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,800
from the

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
likes it it asks for the

162
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,960
uh explicitly verification of the user

163
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,440
whether

164
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
uh they are trusted or not the concept

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:12,960
of

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,400
came about the zero test model moves

167
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,479
security away from implied trust

168
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,800
that is based on network location

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,240
instead it focuses

170
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,960
on evaluating trust on a per transaction

171
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,319
basis

172
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,479
then we come to after zero trust it

173
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,960
evolved to zero trust access model which

174
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,280
is

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,560
zta and then it further evolved to ztna

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,440
which is zero trust network access mode

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,759
zero trust access is about knowing and

178
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,720
controlling who and what is on your

179
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
a network role based access control is a

180
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,720
critical component of access management

181
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,000
only by knowing definitely who a user is

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
can be appropriate level of access be

183
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
granted based on their role

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,199
is the user an employee a guest or a

185
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,919
contractor

186
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,560
or can be even a malicious guest in our

187
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
network

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,160
whatever is the role and what network

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,360
exercise does that role entitle simple

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
unfortunately ztna isn't the most

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
obvious naming convention

192
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,000
because although it's called zero trust

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,199
network access

194
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,360
it's really all about brokered access

195
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
for users to applications

196
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,400
so it might have been a clear call to

197
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
zero test application access

198
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,440
but better or worse inside a key

199
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,000
takeaway

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
is that said dna is an element of the

201
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,080
larger zta proposition

202
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
so uh i try to explain how sassy

203
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,319
actually works

204
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,680
so first a convergence sas is basically

205
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,240
a convergence of van wide area network

206
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,319
it's the simplest form a wide area

207
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
network is a collection of a local area

208
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,520
networks or

209
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,000
other networks that communicate with one

210
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,960
another

211
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
a van is essentially a network of

212
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,199
networks and the internet was used

213
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
almost every second of the day is the

214
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,680
biggest brand we use

215
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,800
then we come to our casp solution which

216
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,599
is a cloud

217
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,400
access security broker according to

218
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,120
gartner

219
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
cloud security access broker is an

220
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,319
on-premises

221
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,240
or cloud-based security policy

222
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
enforcement point

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,919
that is placed between a cloud service

224
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,440
consumers and a

225
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,240
cloud service provider to combat and

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,520
intercept the enterprise security policy

227
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,199
as cloud-based resources are accessed

228
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
as we all know organizations are

229
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
increasingly turning to csp

230
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,519
vendors to address cloud services

231
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,360
enforcing security policies and

232
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
complying with regulations even when

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,958
cloud services are beyond their

234
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,919
parameter

235
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
and out of the direct control

236
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,080
then we come to our fw aes service which

237
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
is firewall as a service

238
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
firewall as a service refers to a cloud

239
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
firework

240
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,320
that delivers advanced layer seven or we

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,959
can say

242
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,680
next generation firewall capabilities

243
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,320
including

244
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,640
access control such as url filtering

245
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
advanced threat protection

246
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
inclusion prevention and or dna security

247
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
the concept of firewall as a service is

248
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
not about simply virtualizing

249
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
appliances firewall as a service enables

250
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,360
organizations to

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,200
eliminate firewall and simplify the uh

252
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,080
we can say it infrastructure centralized

253
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,560
management from a single console enables

254
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,839
organizations

255
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,000
to eliminate the challenges of change

256
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,839
control touch management

257
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,480
coordinating outreach windows and policy

258
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,200
management

259
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,360
associated with next generation firewall

260
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,640
appliances

261
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
while delivering consistent policies

262
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
across the organization where users can

263
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
fit

264
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
then we come to zero trust model so

265
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,040
basically sassy is upon

266
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,519
convergence of wide area networking or

267
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,399
ban

268
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,200
and network security services like casb

269
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,519
firewall as a service in xero trust into

270
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,480
a single cloud delivered service model

271
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,000
according to gartner sassy capabilities

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,160
are delivered as a service base

273
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,880
upon the identity of the entity

274
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,160
real-time context

275
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,959
enterprise security compliance policies

276
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,360
and

277
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
continuous assign assessment of risk

278
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
trust throughout the sessions

279
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,920
identities of identities can be

280
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,519
associated with people

281
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,560
group of people devices applications

282
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,279
services

283
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,959
iot systems or edge computing locations

284
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,959
gartner is expects that by 2024 at least

285
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,480
40 percent of

286
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,640
the enterprises will have explicit

287
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
strategies to adopt chassis

288
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,560
up from less than one percent at the

289
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
year end of 2018.

290
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,959
that's servicing right a sassy

291
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,000
architecture

292
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,959
identifies users and devices apply

293
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,519
policy-based equality and deliver secure

294
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,240
access to

295
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,040
appropriate application or data this

296
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,600
approach

297
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
allows organizations to apply secure

298
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
secure access

299
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,560
no matter where the users applications

300
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,920
or devices are located

301
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
so basically

302
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,160
as i have seen that uh people confuse

303
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,040
that

304
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,519
it's said dna versus sassy all but

305
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,200
uh ztna and sassy but think of sassy as

306
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
a higher level design philosophy than

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,320
ztn

308
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
they are not separate or competing

309
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,120
network security models rather ztn is a

310
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,760
part of an

311
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,959
overall sassy architecture note however

312
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,839
that while security implementation

313
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,920
may be short to medium term objective

314
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
for network architects

315
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,079
sas is a long-term goal organizations

316
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,480
may decide today and they buy into sassy

317
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,200
approach

318
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
and then move slowly while their network

319
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
and security starts

320
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
towards the sassy model they will take

321
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
time as designers move to a place

322
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,320
outdated security technologies and

323
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,959
better integrate those that remain

324
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,440
note that moving to a sassy model both

325
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
requires and enables a zero trust

326
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,320
approach

327
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,399
to network security here we have this uh

328
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,079
sassy architecture

329
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,399
mainly sassy aim is to blend these

330
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,920
services and technologies

331
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
to build a cloud-aware and cloud-based

332
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,519
security network

333
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,839
a sassy model is especially appealing to

334
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,120
organizations

335
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
that abidently use the cloud and cloud

336
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,399
services

337
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,120
or are on a part to the cloud this

338
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,519
includes distributed organizations for

339
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,639
example

340
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,959
those with branch location and dispersed

341
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,000
end users

342
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,320
as well as businesses with iot and 8

343
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,920
deployments

344
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
the sassy security model can help your

345
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,639
organization in several ways

346
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,920
first which is flexibility imagine with

347
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,160
a

348
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,240
cloud-based infrastructure you can

349
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,519
implement and deliver

350
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,240
club security services such as threat

351
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,959
prevention web filtering sandboxing dns

352
00:12:58,959 --> 00:12:59,760
security

353
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,240
data loss prevention and next-gen

354
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,600
firewalls policies

355
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,399
in a single bundle then cost savings

356
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
instead of buying and managing multiple

357
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,680
point products

358
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,600
utilizing a single platform will

359
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,440
dramatically reduce your cost

360
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
and id resources then it will also

361
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,880
reduce the complexity of the network

362
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,760
you can simply uh you can simply

363
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
simplify your id infrastructure by

364
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,519
minimizing the number of security

365
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,399
products

366
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,040
your id team has to manage update and

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,920
maintain

368
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,240
consolidating your security stack into a

369
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,079
cloud-based network security service

370
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,399
then sassy model also helps in

371
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,000
increasing the performance

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
with the cloud infrastructure you can

373
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,079
easily connect to wherever resources are

374
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,199
located

375
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,360
access to applications internet and

376
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,279
corporate data is available globally

377
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,120
these days

378
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
then zero trust model is add on to the

379
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,320
sassy model

380
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480
or it always includes the zero test

381
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,120
model a zero twist approach to the cloud

382
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,040
removes stress assumptions when user

383
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,120
devices or applications connect

384
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,279
a sassy solution will provide complete

385
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,279
session protection regardless of whether

386
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,199
a user is on or off the corporate

387
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,480
network

388
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,720
then it comes with threat prevention

389
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,680
like with full

390
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,760
content inspection integrated into a

391
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,279
sassy solution

392
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,279
you benefit from more security and

393
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,519
visibility in your network

394
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,760
then as we said that dlp and data

395
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
protection comes with sassy implementing

396
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,720
data protection policies within sassy

397
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,839
payment help prevent

398
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,920
unauthorized access and abuse of the

399
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,800
sensitive data

400
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,480
it is uh like achieving it is

401
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,959
a myth that achieving zero trust is

402
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,920
often perceived as costly and complex

403
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
however zero twist is built upon your

404
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
existing architecture

405
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
and does not require you to rip and

406
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,600
replace existing technologies

407
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,560
there are no zero or such zero trust

408
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
products in the market

409
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,240
they are products that will work in zero

410
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
trust environments and those that don't

411
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,720
zero trust is also quite simply to

412
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
deploy implement and maintain using a

413
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
simple five methodology

414
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,320
which is uh identifying the protect

415
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,120
surface

416
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,760
map the transaction flows build us your

417
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
trust architecture create zero trust

418
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
policy and then monitor and maintain

419
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,560
protection service can consist of

420
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,600
identities

421
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,759
endpoints data application

422
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,959
infrastructure and network

423
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,279
building a zero trust zero trust

424
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,160
architecture

425
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,360
includes these major four steps due to

426
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
uh utilization of micro segmentation

427
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
so what is micro segmentation micro

428
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,199
segmentation is the process of breaking

429
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,199
up the security parameters

430
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,600
into small zones to maintain separate

431
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,079
access for separate parts of the network

432
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,480
for example a network with files living

433
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
in a single data center

434
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,800
that utilizes micro segmentation may

435
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
contain dozens of separate secure zones

436
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,839
a person or program with access to one

437
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,920
of those zones will not be able to

438
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,800
access

439
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,480
any of the other zones without the

440
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
separate authorization

441
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,360
so basically it is like further

442
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,399
segmentation of

443
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,600
access then we come to uh

444
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,839
multi-factor or the authentic

445
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,920
multi-factor authentication is a basic

446
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
building block of an intelligent

447
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,839
approach to network security

448
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,920
properly use it it reflects the guiding

449
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,160
principle of the zero trust never trust

450
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,199
always verify and verify explicitly our

451
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,440
mfa requires the presentation of two or

452
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,759
more

453
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,480
authentication factors such as a

454
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,519
knowledge factor

455
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,600
something only the users know such as

456
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,279
password pin or pattern

457
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,839
a position factor something only the

458
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,279
user has such as an

459
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,480
atm card smart card then an inheritance

460
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,279
factor

461
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,199
something which contains a biometric

462
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,040
characteristics such as fingerprint

463
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,680
retina

464
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,319
and face scan upon presentation each

465
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,000
factor must be validated for

466
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,039
authentication to occur

467
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,520
then we come to our come to principle of

468
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,720
least privilege

469
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,439
principle of least privileges also know

470
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,599
known as need to know basis

471
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,839
it is a practice of limiting access

472
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,679
rights for users to bear minimum

473
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,799
permissions

474
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,359
they need to perform their work under

475
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,880
principle of least privilege

476
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
users are granted permission to read

477
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
write or execute

478
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,240
only the file source resources they need

479
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,760
to do their jobs

480
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
in other words the least amount of

481
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,679
privilege necessary

482
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,440
additionally the principle of these

483
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,679
privilege can be applied to restricting

484
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,880
access

485
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,200
rights for application system processes

486
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,280
and devices to only those permissions

487
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,320
required to perform authorized activity

488
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,760
just like users the user

489
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,520
devices cannot be trusted without

490
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,799
verification

491
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,520
to achieve complete zero trust security

492
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
identity centric controls must be

493
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,480
extended to the endpoint that means

494
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
every device used to gain

495
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,440
access to the cooperative sources must

496
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
first be enrolled so that it can be

497
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,760
recognized and verified

498
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,000
device verification should be enable an

499
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
organization to determine

500
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
whether the endpoint seeking to access

501
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
internal required

502
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,520
resources mixes this security

503
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,320
requirements or not

504
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
then we come to guiding principles of

505
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,840
zero trust model

506
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,000
it is mainly based on three principles

507
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,840
which are verify explicitly

508
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
use of least privileged access and

509
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
assuming a breach

510
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
verify explicitly is always authenticate

511
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
and authorize based on all available

512
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,520
data points

513
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,640
including user identity location devices

514
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,679
service or workload data classification

515
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,960
and anomalies can be

516
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,480
included as using uh lease privilege

517
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,200
accesses

518
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
limited user access with just in time

519
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,240
and just

520
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,799
enough access this space adaptive

521
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,720
policies and data protection to help

522
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,960
secure both data and productivity

523
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
productivity of the users assuming

524
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,559
breaches minimizing the blast radio soil

525
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,600
beaches

526
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,280
and prevent lateral movement by

527
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
segmenting access by network

528
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,559
user devices and app awareness assuming

529
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,840
which as we can see

530
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,760
is all uh always included into

531
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,160
corporations cyber resilience programs

532
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,039
as well

533
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
verifying all sessions are encrypted

534
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,600
end-to-end and use analytics to get

535
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,880
visibility drive

536
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,039
threat retention and improve defenses

537
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,559
the zero to security market will grow to

538
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,400
uh grow from 19.6 billion dollars

539
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,440
in 2022 it is expected to grow

540
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,640
from 19.6 billion in 2020

541
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
to 51.6 billion dollars in 2026

542
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,400
as data security solutions are

543
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
responsible for securing business

544
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,280
database

545
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,000
and information such as customer details

546
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,760
financial information and employee

547
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,880
database

548
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,360
as well as the other key business data

549
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
of any organization

550
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,360
huge amount of data is generated every

551
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,280
day across organization

552
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,360
in various industry verticals and

553
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
effective management

554
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,919
an organization database may comprise of

555
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,840
sensitive data such as

556
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,559
personally identifiable information

557
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,480
personal health information or

558
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,720
intellectual property as well as payment

559
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,880
card and financial information

560
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,840
so corporations are moving more to the

561
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,799
zero trust uh

562
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,559
model to secure their data

563
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,159
uh i would like to uh thank uh mr

564
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,120
amin ghilani who uh who was uh the coach

565
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,600
for

566
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,960
this for this particular talk and uh

567
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,360
maggie fellow to help me making slides

568
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,000
and stay safe i always have in my back

569
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,840
uh thank you or any questions

570
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,720
i'm not seeing any questions in the

571
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,440
discord channel

572
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
but what are some of your favorite um

573
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,720
tools

574
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,240
paid or open source to um audit or

575
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,360
evaluate zero trust if any

576
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,559
uh okay so uh

577
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,360
according uh like during my uh

578
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
experience for zero trust model i have

579
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,000
used

580
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,559
various palo alto or products such as

581
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,600
prisma

582
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,000
or their sassy infrastructure for

583
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,840
firewall as a service we have used next

584
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,520
generation firewalls

585
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,159
and then as an edr we have used cortex

586
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,400
here

587
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
awesome

588
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,720
i have a comment that says no questions

589
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,159
here but great job looks like everyone

590
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:13,840
really loved the talk

591
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
we have them for just another few

592
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,520
minutes if anyone has any questions and

593
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:27,840
wants to put them up in discord

594
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
mm-hmm

595
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,120
why do you why do you like zero trust

596
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,559
over other models

597
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,760
of i i know it's not a regulatory

598
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,919
framework but why is zero trust one of

599
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,200
your preferred frameworks

600
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,200
uh like as we are evolving in the

601
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,159
technology

602
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
our traditional security models trust

603
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,360
the users or our internal applications

604
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,080
or internal

605
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,919
devices but internal users or granted

606
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,640
employees are

607
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,679
side granted employees can go broke even

608
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,960
machines can go low

609
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,760
and even the trusted applications can

610
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,960
can go low

611
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,440
so under the zero trust model we verify

612
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,679
explicitly verify again and again and

613
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,120
again

614
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,400
uh in regular intervals of time so

615
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,200
this not our factor of truss we

616
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,840
eliminate the trust function

617
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,120
yeah i um i was first exposed to zero

618
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,640
trust when i started using infection

619
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,440
monkey

620
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,840
infection monkey will actually give you

621
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,279
in its reporting output

622
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,279
like miter alignment as well as zero

623
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,360
trust kind of compliance alignment which

624
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,000
is pretty fantastic considering it uses

625
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,120
a propagating agent

626
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,840
anything from you wade i got nothing i

627
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
have no experience in zero trust so it

628
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,159
was

629
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,880
a lot for me um i'm still trying to

630
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,240
catch up on all of it

631
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,400
but it was a good presentation i enjoyed

632
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,919
it overall

633
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,080
i'm a big advocate of zero trust because

634
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
trust in relationships

635
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
um it's actually a minor ttp it's one of

636
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,679
those things that can like

637
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,080
like we in red teaming so rely upon to

638
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
abuse like oh like

639
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,320
you have an octa-session cookie so you

640
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,080
have a trusted relationship to all these

641
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
applications or whatever and it's like

642
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,960
xero trust says verify every request

643
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,000
every resource

644
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,640
every person every time like there is no

645
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,039
trusted relationship there is no

646
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,840
like just assumed permissions access at

647
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,600
any level it's like everything is going

648
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
to be verified every time which i'm

649
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,559
personally

650
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,720
a really big fan of from the blue side

651
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,080
even though it makes my red teaming life

652
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,639
a little harder

653
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,559
30 minutes our next talk so we have some

654
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,880
time to burn

655
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,080
30 30 or 20. is it 20 i thought next one

656
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,919
starts at 12 30.

657
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,159
is that yeah 12 30. it's gonna be like 9

658
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
30 our time

659
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,159
right yeah yeah you're right you're

660
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,919
right yeah i am right

661
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,440
after every time everyone is here wait

662
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
say that jerome is here where you tell

663
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,919
me i'm right

664
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,799
this is recorded so i guess uh see how

665
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,559
many times we can get

666
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,360
there will be evidence uh i realize

667
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,000
so uh we got one question how would you

668
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,640
get started on adopting zero trust

669
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,679
ooh great question

670
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,120
uh so basically zero truss

671
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,880
adopting zero uh first the

672
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,640
uh zero truss model should be

673
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,320
a ideology more than the specific tools

674
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,919
like management should see the

675
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,520
organization traffic

676
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,840
incoming and outbring on the basis of

677
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,520
zero trust model

678
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,400
so first the uh ideology should be

679
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,600
adopted then the

680
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
tools should be tuned on the basis of

681
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,840
zero trust in the verification and

682
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,279
authorization must be there

683
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,120
good principle to live by security is

684
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,720
doing the basics well people this is

685
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,080
basically what xero trust says

686
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
likely doing the basics well is hard

687
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,840
otherwise i wouldn't have a job

688
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,480
right now

689
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,600
all right well thank you so much that

690
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
was an amazing way to kick off

691
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,640
um the new speakers track over here uh i

692
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,760
