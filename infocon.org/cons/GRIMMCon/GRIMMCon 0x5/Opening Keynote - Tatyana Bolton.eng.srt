1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,040
thank you for having me

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,720
i i appreciate you uh

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,279
having this very important conversation

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,080
uh my name

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,560
is tatiana bolton and i'm the policy

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,560
director for cyber security and emerging

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,240
threats at our street institute where

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,119
bryson is also a senior fellow

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,719
prior to joining our street i was the

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,320
policy director of the cyberspace

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,280
solarium commission

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,520
and the cyber policy lead at cizza the

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,879
cyber security and infrastructure

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,559
security agency which

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,360
so many people still don't know about uh

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,239
sad

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,480
as part of the cyber security workforce

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,239
i'm watching emerging threats

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,000
uh things that are gonna impact us in

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,360
the future and perhaps

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
perhaps 20 perhaps two years down the

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,680
line and some of what i see matches the

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,199
focus of policy makers

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,079
and some doesn't so i'm going to go out

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,960
on a limb here

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,760
and say that you're not really surprised

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
by all of the high-profile ransomware

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,119
incidents this year

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,280
you saw the threat of ransomware coming

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,320
although

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,119
many policymakers didn't ransomware has

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:13,439
now

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,880
made the top of the list of the most

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,479
salient threats facing the cyber

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,159
security community today

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
both sisa the white house and the uk's

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,360
gchq

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
have all put it on the top of their

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,320
lists of threats facing the global

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
community

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,479
and thanks to the number of recent

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,680
newsworthy hacks

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,479
cassaya jbs colonial pipeline to name

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,119
the most

45
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,360
noteworthy ransomware is finally getting

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,880
the attention it deserves

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
but i'm here today to discuss what i

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,000
believe is an even greater

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,079
threat to the cyber security community

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,840
and one that isn't making headlines in

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,799
the news

52
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,799
our lack of diversity uh in our

53
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,320
workforce

54
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
so let's just take a moment to

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,880
compare the two threats yes ransomware

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,320
is a massive threat that

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,399
has recently affected more than 37

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,840
percent of organizations

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,719
according to sofos from driving gas

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,840
panics in june

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,759
to more recently forcing grocery stores

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,280
and schools offline

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,199
ransomware has affected all areas of

64
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,399
public life

65
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,879
but while 37 percent is a high number

66
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,720
it's nothing compared to the 100 percent

67
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,640
of organizations affected by poor

68
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,480
diversity numbers and a tapped

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
cyber security workforce i mean which

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
one of your organizations isn't affected

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,840
by it

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,319
the cybersecurity ventures official

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,640
annual cybercrime report estimated that

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,840
ransomware could cost

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,760
companies approximately 20 billion

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
dollars in lost revenue

77
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,920
but on the workforce side of the united

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,040
states on the whole

79
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,480
is losing somewhere in the neighborhood

80
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,560
of several trillion dollars in lost

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,280
revenue

82
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
by keeping women for example on the

83
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,519
sidelines of our workforce

84
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,840
but before we dig into the problem let's

85
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,120
define it

86
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
diversity is partly what you're thinking

87
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,480
race

88
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
ethnicity gender and other

89
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,080
underrepresented communities

90
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
but i'm also referring to people with

91
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,920
different native language skills for

92
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,959
example

93
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,360
in 2015 researchers discovered the snow

94
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
globe malware

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
also known as babar and babar is also

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,200
the name of a popular french tv show

97
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
and this linguistic and cultural clue

98
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,440
helped french-speaking researchers trace

99
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
it back to its original creator

100
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,319
france's external intelligence agency

101
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,159
teams with language diversity bring a

102
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,159
broader understanding to a cyberspace

103
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,400
that is global by default

104
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,239
diversity also means bringing in the

105
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,920
neurodiverse community

106
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
the cyberspace solarium commission of

107
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
which i was part recommended that the

108
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,200
neurodiverse should be included in the

109
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,959
cyber workforce as they bring unique

110
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,560
skills to the table

111
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,959
some on the autism spectrum for example

112
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,720
are adept at spotting patterns where

113
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,920
others can't

114
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,080
that's why military national security

115
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,400
and health organizations in the uk

116
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
australia and israel have developed

117
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,959
special hiring programs to attract newer

118
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,560
diverse individuals

119
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,480
companies like bank of america have gone

120
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
further incorporating neurodiverse

121
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,360
talent as part of their hiring strategy

122
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,599
it also includes hiring people who come

123
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,680
from different economic backgrounds

124
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,239
working styles and thought processes

125
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,680
because diversity of thought

126
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
isn't just relegated to men versus women

127
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,959
or black or

128
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,200
versus white with a holistic

129
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,720
understanding of diversity

130
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,560
we can paint a better picture of how to

131
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,639
foster a truly diverse cybersecurity

132
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,600
workforce

133
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
even if it shows us how much work

134
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,160
there's left to be done

135
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,360
look diversity is not just about

136
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
checking boxes or being woke it's a real

137
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
concern for the overall security of the

138
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,759
industry

139
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,080
and its effectiveness from my

140
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,800
perspective

141
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
working on cyber security through a

142
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
national security lens

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,280
it's detrimental to artifacts a lack of

144
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,199
diversity can make organizations

145
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
weaker to vulnerabilities a homogeneous

146
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
workforce tends to

147
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,440
execute similar working styles similar

148
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
perspectives and similar problem solving

149
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,400
techniques

150
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,639
and that's dangerous these teams are

151
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
also more susceptible to groupthink

152
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
falling into patterns of behavior and

153
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
have a tendency to avoid

154
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,880
change mit found that this environment

155
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
doesn't just mean a likelihood of more

156
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,759
mistakes

157
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
it means that unfortunately people are

158
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
more likely to copy

159
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,080
poor decisions within a team now that

160
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
means we may not see

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,320
uh the ransomware attack coming because

162
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,840
our existing workforce has worked

163
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,479
together

164
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
learn together and think the same way

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
a recent study found that inclusive

166
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
teams made

167
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
both better and quicker decisions people

168
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,039
still tell me

169
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,039
that pulling in diversity is just

170
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,639
weakening the talent pool

171
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,039
but that simply isn't true according to

172
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,560
the harvard business review

173
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
diverse teams demonstrate demonstrably

174
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,320
perform better

175
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
focusing focusing more on the facts and

176
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,800
processing those facts more carefully

177
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,120
they're also more innovative in fact

178
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
companies that performed best in the

179
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,919
last recession

180
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,520
were those who had the most women on

181
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
their corporate boards helping

182
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
demonstrate the point the diversity in

183
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,600
the workforce

184
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,840
leads to improved performance and cyber

185
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,759
security isn't any different

186
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,080
attaining this objective means expanding

187
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
the concept of what society sees as a

188
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
cyber security professional

189
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,560
including in the leadership ranks cyber

190
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,720
is about more than computer science

191
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
not that women and minorities are bad at

192
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,080
that either

193
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
and requires skills like analysis

194
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
creative thinking

195
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
and communication at which to women tend

196
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,280
to excel

197
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
new blood and new thinking is

198
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
advantageous in many ways

199
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,840
in 2021 a new female employee at fireeye

200
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,080
caught a discrepancy in an employee file

201
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,199
and flagged it for

202
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,440
per proper procedure for immediate

203
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,759
review as potentially fraudulent

204
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,240
most veteran veteran employees kevin

205
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,960
mandy

206
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,280
kevin mandia argued on the cipher brief

207
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,720
might not have flagged it as a

208
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,039
top security priority but because she

209
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,639
had a different perspective this new

210
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,199
employee

211
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,880
alerted fireeye to one of the biggest

212
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
breaches in recent memory

213
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,039
if it hadn't been for her who knows when

214
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,560
we would have discovered the solarwinds

215
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,360
breach

216
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,919
this is just one example of how we're

217
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,440
missing out on still having a

218
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,400
predominantly

219
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
homogeneous cyber security workforce in

220
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
2021.

221
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
women for example were among the first

222
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
programmers invented the science of

223
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,720
cryptography and worked as code girls as

224
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
early as 1941

225
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
but 80 years later the field consists of

226
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,680
a mere

227
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,199
24 women that's not a lot of progress

228
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,240
to show for the 21st century for african

229
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,960
americans they make up only 11.9 percent

230
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
of the information security analysts in

231
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,080
2020

232
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,160
latin americans fared little better

233
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
taking up only 15.8 percent of the

234
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
workforce

235
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
these figures don't inspire confidence

236
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,360
and they don't make much sense

237
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,199
considering the sustained high demand

238
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,879
for talent which has become so

239
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
overwhelming to the tune of 464

240
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,039
000 vacancies that's of today

241
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,800
that companies are struggling to hire

242
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,879
competent and trained people

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
so we're we've we're disappointed with

244
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
two aspects of the hiring process

245
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,080
but the workforce remains woefully

246
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,599
homogenous

247
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
and with such a gap in the workforce

248
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,960
it's hard not to be disappointed

249
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,199
but it also raises the question of why

250
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,120
our cybersecurity workforce looks the

251
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,840
way it does

252
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
how do we get here well first i

253
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,120
i think too many people continue to

254
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,360
think it isn't a problem

255
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,000
second structurally the winnowing starts

256
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,639
early

257
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,200
reducing reducing the number of women

258
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
and minorities in our particular field

259
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
due to a lack

260
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,120
of appeal to girls at an early age a

261
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,559
lack of mentors

262
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,599
and unconscious as well as over bias

263
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,440
women are not given constructive

264
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
criticism to improve

265
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
and don't get promoted at the same rates

266
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
as men moreover

267
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
assertiveness which is seen as a

268
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
leadership quality in men

269
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
remains seen as a negative in women pay

270
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,320
inequities continue to persist in the

271
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,800
field

272
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,959
and the workforce at large according to

273
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,120
the bureau of labor statistics

274
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,279
what's worse women of color face even

275
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,279
steeper challenges in both pay equity

276
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,000
and promotion

277
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,399
than their white female counterparts as

278
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,920
the director of strategic threat

279
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,600
development at recorded future

280
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
argued the wide variety of people and

281
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,519
experience we have defending our

282
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,320
networks

283
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,120
the better our chances of success and

284
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,640
these barriers prevent women from

285
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
participating fully in the cyber

286
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,839
security field

287
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
despite the efforts of organizations

288
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
like blacks and cyber

289
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,920
black cyber security association empower

290
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
and share the mic and cyber and many

291
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,320
many

292
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,600
uh many more many blacks or minorities

293
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
with interest in cyber securities are

294
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
struggling to break in

295
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
and with the growing need for more cyber

296
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,480
professionals it's imperative that we

297
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,760
acknowledge the effects

298
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,839
of the lack of diversity and take a look

299
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,720
at some of the barriers to entry

300
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,760
so along with pipeline issues barriers

301
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
to entry have played a role in stifling

302
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,040
diversity

303
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
no matter the field or person everyone

304
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
needs their first break for a job

305
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
understandably due to its nature

306
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,519
recruiters and hiring managers within

307
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,959
the field of cyber security

308
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,480
must be highly selective with its

309
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
candidates however

310
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,079
to diversify the pool of candidates

311
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,399
there should be room to make room

312
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,079
and by making room i mean that we have

313
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
to shift and take a look at some of the

314
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
factors that hinder diverse individuals

315
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,279
from considering the field

316
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,160
applying for jobs or getting hired some

317
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,279
of the things to consider

318
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,680
include the lack of mentors need for

319
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,720
technical training

320
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,680
lack of financial resources and language

321
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,760
and ads and cyber security jobs

322
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
criteria for entry-level roles like

323
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,000
traditional educational background

324
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
and last but certainly not least the

325
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,279
unwillingness to give someone a chance

326
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,959
in the interest of time i'll share my

327
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,720
thoughts on three barriers

328
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
mentorship recruitment and entry-level

329
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,399
job criteria

330
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
to start people strive to become who or

331
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,240
what they can see

332
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,480
it allows them to have a living visual

333
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
representation of a goal

334
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
if you ask children what they want to be

335
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
when they grow up how many

336
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,880
would say cyber security analyst answers

337
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,079
like firefighter

338
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,399
teacher doctor hairdresser aren't

339
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,760
shocking because

340
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,560
many more than likely the child has

341
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,279
experienced

342
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,760
or seen someone working in that role

343
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,399
cyber security is a bit different

344
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,640
while we work in the role uh it's not

345
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,480
seen as glamorous and the good guys are

346
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,200
in the background

347
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,040
and only those interested in it talk

348
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
about it and that's why i started the

349
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,079
making space pledge

350
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,200
to ensure professionals that up and

351
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
comers see on stages and panels

352
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,079
and zooms aren't just white men they're

353
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,040
all of us

354
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
and they include women and people of

355
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,120
color a pledge to which more than 50

356
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
organizations and individuals have

357
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,079
signed on

358
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,079
starting with this small step we can get

359
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,560
more talent interested in cyber security

360
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,399
and grow the diversity of our workforce

361
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,160
from an early age

362
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
so what would make the industry

363
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,760
appealing to someone who hasn't heard of

364
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
it and doesn't know anyone who works in

365
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,240
it

366
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,959
a mentor mentorship is one of the most

367
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,480
powerful ways to influence

368
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,880
and possibly change the course of

369
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
someone's life

370
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,560
after all an hr study found that mentees

371
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,000
are five times more likely

372
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,680
to get promoted than those without a

373
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,839
mentor and women and minorities

374
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,920
are much less likely to have a mentor

375
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,360
than white men

376
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,120
we need more and more diverse

377
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,880
professionals in the field to make

378
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
themselves available

379
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,320
and to advocate for their mentees a step

380
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,120
that goes beyond

381
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
answering questions but truly supporting

382
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
young professionals careers

383
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,519
and by doing so the field will seem less

384
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,160
foreign

385
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,079
and hopefully become more appealing to

386
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,000
those who were not previously exposed to

387
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
its opportunities

388
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
secondly we need to take a look at how

389
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
and where the jobs are advertised

390
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
if people don't know about opportunities

391
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
how will they apply

392
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,959
we need to start looking at traditional

393
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
and non-traditional ways to get the word

394
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,440
out

395
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,200
we're all familiar with popular job

396
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
search websites but also

397
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
in we also live in the age of social

398
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,800
media advertising

399
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,079
where 79 of job seekers use social media

400
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,600
in their search

401
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,360
if we've been missing the mark with

402
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
reaching a more diverse pool of

403
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
candidates then it's time

404
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,399
to shift the focus we need to go where

405
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,920
the diverse candidates are

406
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,519
if they're going to boot camps we need

407
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,880
to work with their schools career

408
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,680
centers

409
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760
and perhaps that person who took a boot

410
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
camp and came from a university

411
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,360
not normally known to foster cyber

412
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,639
security talent

413
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,160
will have just the right background to

414
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,480
respond to the next ransomware attack

415
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,600
or think like the attacker lastly

416
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
we need to take a look at why those who

417
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,240
are interested in cyber security and who

418
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,959
who do apply for jobs don't get hired

419
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,160
when prerequisites

420
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,560
are determined for entry level roles how

421
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,320
much is taken into consideration

422
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
about the absolute necessity of required

423
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,360
skills

424
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,079
versus nice to haves aptitude and

425
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,000
potential to thrive in a role

426
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,959
may be weeded out maybe weeded out early

427
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:51,760
on

428
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,279
simply because they didn't have

429
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,279
experience or don't need traditional

430
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,360
criteria like a bachelor's degree from a

431
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,199
prestigious university

432
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,360
or they may simply present differently

433
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
than a typical candidate

434
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,519
what about your interview process focus

435
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,360
on competencies and aptitude

436
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,440
rather than experience when candidates

437
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,800
make it to the final round of an

438
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
interview but aren't selected and have

439
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,880
talent

440
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,360
what happens can those with aptitude be

441
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
funneled into a training program or

442
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,399
bootcamp

443
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,399
when new opportunities arise do you go

444
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,399
back and revisit past applicants

445
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,880
or start with a brand new search all in

446
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,199
all barriers exist that can't be ignored

447
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,959
if we truly want to solve the diversity

448
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,160
problem

449
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
so what should we change and what can we

450
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,199
do differently

451
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,639
i think we need to work on building a

452
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,320
pipeline at the high school and even

453
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,360
middle school level

454
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
some of which we do but we need to

455
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,040
supercharge it we need to work with

456
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
specialized schools and boot camps to

457
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,560
find talent for recruitment

458
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,399
we need to resource government agency

459
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,320
hiring departments so that hiring and

460
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
talent management are a priority for our

461
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,120
federal government

462
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
and make cyber security cachet like the

463
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,800
intelligence community

464
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,880
we need to offer uh scholarships for

465
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,000
training to launch

466
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,560
careers in cyber security malwarebytes

467
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,320
for example was offering ten ten

468
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,680
thousand dollar scholarships to those

469
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
who applied before july first of this

470
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,480
year

471
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,880
uh we need to identify lower level tasks

472
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,720
and the responsibility to help create

473
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,040
more

474
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,959
entry-level jobs where individuals have

475
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,480
an opportunity to get their foot in the

476
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,920
door and show potential

477
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,000
and stop requiring bachelor's degrees

478
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,839
and five years of experience

479
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,199
ah can you hear me now

480
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,440
yep yeah we see it yeah so you all could

481
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,880
see us but we lost we lost tatiana again

482
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,240
right as right as we were getting into

483
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,759
the solutioning right like you know we

484
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,600
build up the problem and then it's like

485
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,959
solve it and it starts with and it goes

486
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,680
away

487
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,000
i'm actually back now she's back

488
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,079
okay great today is the worst um

489
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,199
okay tell me tell me where i left off

490
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,480
uh you were right in the middle of

491
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
the uh the second point um um

492
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,519
so we just talked about high schools

493
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,199
middle schools yeah

494
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,360
uh you don't have to like stop requiring

495
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,959
five years yeah

496
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,000
yes um yeah i mean

497
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,399
i i definitely think we need to stop

498
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,160
requiring bachelor's degrees when we're

499
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,959
talking about

500
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,680
junior uh level uh junior level

501
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,800
positions

502
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,560
you may not realize it but there are

503
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,079
natural gender discrepancies for

504
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,679
applicants for example

505
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,599
uh when women apply for a job they want

506
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,199
to feel like they've met 100 of job

507
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,959
requirements and men apply when they

508
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,319
feel like they've met 60

509
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,559
of those requirements so just at the

510
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,079
front end you're missing a significant

511
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,679
portion of qualified applicants by

512
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,240
increasing

513
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,959
those requirements we also need to avoid

514
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,760
tokenism and performative diversity

515
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
and we need to showcase star employees

516
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,280
outside of cyber security focused

517
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,880
platforms and mediums

518
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,320
it's important to put a face to those

519
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,559
who typically work behind the scenes

520
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,600
some go to resources and uh to leverage

521
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
include the making space pledge on our

522
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,080
site

523
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,120
cyber security influencers and podcasts

524
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,520
and cyber security tech recruiters and

525
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,240
lastly

526
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,320
listen take the time to engage with

527
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,760
minority colleagues and hear their

528
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,480
perspectives

529
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
and ask them for their ideas demand for

530
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,360
cybersecurity talent has become so

531
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,559
overwhelming

532
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,720
that the us government and private

533
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,760
industry must

534
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,440
as a matter of national security

535
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
eliminate the systemic barriers that are

536
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
preventing employers from tapping into

537
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,720
women and minorities as a source of

538
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
potential cyber security aptitude

539
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,520
the math is simple we must recruit women

540
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,840
and people of color into cyber security

541
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
just like we've been urging companies

542
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,960
for years to take the threat of

543
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
ransomware and zero days

544
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
seriously is where we are now with the

545
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,480
threat to our cyber workforce

546
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
if we don't address the growing gap in

547
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,320
cyber professionals and the need to

548
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,679
invest in bringing diverse

549
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,440
backgrounds and perspectives into cyber

550
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
security ten years from now

551
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,240
we may be in a hole we can't fill let's

552
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,760
not get to a place where it becomes an

553
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,520
emergency and let's take diversity as

554
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,919
security seriously today

555
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,840
thanks so much

556
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,600
so how can we get um the folks that are

557
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,480
watching this involved what can they do

558
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,799
well like i said so one um start to

559
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,840
think of yourself as part of the

560
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,080
solution

561
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,440
if there are opportunities in

562
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,559
your organization try to

563
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,799
target try to find people that you know

564
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,080
that are

565
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,679
that are women or people of color that

566
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,280
you think might be good for the role and

567
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
encourage them to apply

568
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,720
you may think they'd apply anyway but

569
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,120
you it's actually not so much so certain

570
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,840
because a lot of

571
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
like i said a lot of women wait till

572
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,600
they feel like they're 100 qualified so

573
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,480
if you know

574
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
if you know a woman who is qualified for

575
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,080
a position in your organization

576
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
and you you believe in that person

577
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,280
encourage them

578
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,880
tell them that you know they don't need

579
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
to necessarily be 100

580
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,440
perfect for the role uh throw in your

581
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,160
resume

582
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,280
and see what happens

583
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,760
yeah it's very interesting that idea of

584
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,520
feeling like you have to be 100

585
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
i mean i felt it too right i think i

586
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,480
think it's so interesting why do you

587
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,320
think that happens

588
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
i think we have a culture where we set

589
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,919
different standards for women and for

590
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,640
men

591
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,080
um we have uh you know our culture

592
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,280
generally uh sort of encourages women to

593
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,000
be

594
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,919
quieter and ask less questions and be

595
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,039
less aggressive

596
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,039
and so when they're in the classroom

597
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,320
that's a perfect

598
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,559
recipe to get great grades and it's a

599
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,640
it's a perfect recipe to excel

600
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,080
you don't necessarily need to raise your

601
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,720
hand to succeed but when you get outside

602
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,520
of school

603
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
that recipe no longer works and men are

604
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,280
encouraged to be more aggressive

605
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,960
to apply for uh positions even when they

606
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,760
may not feel

607
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,840
as 100 qualified they're encouraged to

608
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,919
uh go you know sort of go forth and

609
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,919
prosper based on their potential

610
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,600
um and they're hired based on potential

611
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,120
they're promoted based on potential and

612
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,320
we've seen through

613
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,679
numerous studies that that's not true

614
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,799
for women and minorities

615
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,559
very interesting thank you

616
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,799
it was a really great talk i was like

617
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,960
taking a bunch of notes

618
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,679
since i really got

619
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,120
yeah the part that really got attention

620
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
on discord was the quote of stop

621
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,200
asking for five years of experience and

622
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,240
so that i think

623
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,720
the the other challenge beyond how do we

624
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
get hiring managers

625
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,120
out of that mindset because a hiring

626
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,320
manager is going

627
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
i want to see somebody with

628
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,679
certifications

629
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,679
and the the talk afterward we're going

630
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,440
to be talking about certifications

631
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,840
uh because it's it's the cya for the the

632
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
hiring manager right i don't get fired

633
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,039
for hiring somebody that looked right on

634
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,679
paper

635
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,320
i get i think i'll get fired or i'll get

636
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,520
trouble for

637
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
hiring somebody that wasn't a fit on

638
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
paper

639
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,840
and i think that that's also like a a

640
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,799
leadership issue

641
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,880
right from the very top you need to have

642
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
people who are invested

643
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
in the diversity of the workforce

644
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,760
because it brings strength to the

645
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,799
organization

646
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,720
we have to get away from this concept of

647
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,480
diversity as tokenism

648
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,240
and that you know you know we're just

649
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,760
trying to pull in people who

650
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,120
like you're trying to pull in a woman

651
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,240
because you don't have a woman or you're

652
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,679
trying to pull in someone who's black

653
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,640
because you don't have

654
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,520
any black employees people are bringing

655
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,960
uh different perspectives and different

656
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,919
backgrounds

657
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,240
to the table when when uh they're coming

658
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,159
from different experiences

659
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,520
that's the strength you're bringing and

660
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
so while they may not while they may

661
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,280
have a diverse background or they may

662
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,000
not

663
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,760
um you're bringing in different um

664
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,080
a different and a stronger uh workforce

665
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,960
and so

666
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,440
leaders need to acknowledge the fact

667
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
that like

668
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,679
you may not have five years of

669
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,280
background but that doesn't mean you

670
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,400
don't have the aptitude

671
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
we need to switch to more of an aptitude

672
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,760
model um

673
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,240
you know for example the military right

674
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
they take into account where you

675
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,760
uh where you come from what your

676
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,200
background is and bryson i feel like you

677
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,720
can talk to this more but like

678
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,760
they they at least uh a little bit and

679
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,440
in israel for example they do this a lot

680
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,919
more

681
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,760
they take your aptitude and fit you into

682
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,200
the into the role where they think

683
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000
you'll most

684
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,919
thrive and that's not based on any

685
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,679
experience it's just based on aptitude

686
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,760
so we need to take what works

687
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,559
in places like uh like israel and and

688
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,280
partially

689
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,240
uh our military and use it in the

690
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
private sector and use it across the

691
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
federal government

692
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,240
i mean bryson you uh you've got some

693
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,960
background of that

694
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,640
you're on me thanks

695
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,080
this goes yeah i got a new microphone

696
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,000
set up so i'm i i'm

697
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,159
i'm doing it on purpose so that you feel

698
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,200
like you're not the only one with

699
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
technical challenges tatiana

700
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,000
thank you thank you such a

701
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,400
yeah thank you i give and i just i i

702
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
give through mistakes

703
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,720
you give and you give sorry about your

704
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,919
experience

705
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,520
yeah no the so part of what's hard about

706
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,000
that is

707
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,600
being able to to properly qualify that

708
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,279
candidate like what does that mean what

709
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,400
are the skills

710
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
and having the data to back up how those

711
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,640
you know the that aptitude and what that

712
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
looks like because

713
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,159
what you find that i see is more often

714
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,799
it's kind of the statistical test bias

715
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,200
where you are actually restricting

716
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,400
diversity through

717
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
those kinds of assessments and testing

718
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,240
well so you know i also think it's

719
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,559
important to just give people a chance

720
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,279
um you're doing interviews right so make

721
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,720
sure at least at the interview stage

722
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,000
where you're bringing people in

723
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,440
that you've got a diverse pool of

724
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,279
applicants check yourself

725
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,240
like a lot of the it's funny there was

726
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
one study that said

727
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,720
people who consider themselves um

728
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,120
people who consider that uh they've got

729
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,200
this whole like diversity thing down and

730
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,279
they're you know they understand it and

731
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,640
they don't have an issue

732
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,400
they're the ones who are most at fault

733
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,600
they they do it the worst of anyone

734
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,640
because they don't check themselves when

735
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,520
they're either

736
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
looking through resumes when they're

737
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,880
still moving people forward in the

738
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,600
process

739
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
when they're reviewing uh assessments

740
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,679
and other things

741
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,760
when you when you acknowledge that you

742
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,960
have bias

743
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,440
that is when you acknowledge that you

744
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,880
need to

745
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,440
check for it in all of your steps and

746
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,720
all the processes

747
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,799
and so organizations need to do that

748
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,240
people need to do that

749
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,640
you need to just take a take a step back

750
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,760
and say

751
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,159
am i am i doing am i doing this for the

752
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,440
right reason am i

753
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,279
uh excluding people based on

754
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,120
preconceived notions i have based on

755
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,200
their location based on their name

756
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,679
based on their background or university

757
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,880
or whatever

758
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,919
um and it and and by doing that you

759
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,679
will i think uh more more often than not

760
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,960
and this has been proven through

761
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,840
research pull pull diverse applicants

762
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,000
into your pool when otherwise you would

763
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,159
generally gravitate towards people who

764
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,799
are uh who you feel more comfortable

765
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,279
with

766
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,080
uh it's a human it's a natural human

767
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,080
response right to talk to

768
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,919
and engage with people who are like

769
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,919
ourselves right that's a natural human

770
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,360
response and no one no one's saying

771
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,080
that's bad

772
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,159
we just need to acknowledge that and

773
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,520
acknowledge our own biases

774
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,840
for example you know if you went to

775
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
georgetown you might be more likely to

776
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,360
think of georgetown graduates

777
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,799
as smart amazing people uh but

778
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,640
you know but that doesn't that that's a

779
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
bias in and of itself right so we need

780
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,799
to account for these things when we are

781
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,720
um when we're in that hiring process

782
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,840
question from the audience how can the

783
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
federal government or dod get more

784
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,679
diverse candidates in front of hiring

785
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,880
boards

786
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,320
oh here's here's here's one completely

787
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
redo the usajobs portal

788
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,840
but that thing is a piece of crap um

789
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,080
it's so the whole that whole system i

790
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,679
mean this is like a systemic issue for

791
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,360
the federal government and obviously not

792
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,880
a short-term solution

793
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
um we'll maybe i'll get to that in a

794
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,080
second but like

795
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,600
one of the biggest things they can do is

796
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
is just completely rejigger their hiring

797
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,880
and firing process

798
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,880
um the the way in which usa jobs works

799
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,520
uh you know obviously it was set up to

800
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,880
prevent like nepotism

801
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,159
and prevent people from uh abuses of the

802
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:54,799
system

803
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,960
uh because you're providing uh you know

804
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
you're using taxpayer money to give a

805
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,320
federal job

806
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,960
basically very difficult to fire you

807
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,679
after this

808
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,360
uh process um but

809
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,520
you have to know the system right like

810
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,480
you have to

811
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,600
submit a resume that is exactly tailored

812
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
to each job that you do

813
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,559
you have to make sure that you're

814
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,480
hitting all of the like key points

815
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,880
you have to make sure that you uh know

816
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,840
how this

817
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
how the computer first reads resumes to

818
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,520
really understand the process

819
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,919
you have to know how to answer ksas you

820
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,440
the those stupid questions that they

821
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,960
have you do which basically

822
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,120
top tip you have to say five on all of

823
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,000
them whether or not you're

824
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,320
even qualified um to get through the

825
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,200
process

826
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,039
uh and then you have to you know go

827
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,399
through that process federal government

828
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,600
needs to acknowledge that this is a

829
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,640
broken system

830
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,159
you're not getting the best candidates

831
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,480
you're not getting uh highly qualified

832
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
applicants even you're losing a lot of

833
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,600
talent

834
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,360
through the system in the short term i

835
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
think um

836
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,799
the federal government especially in the

837
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
cyber security world

838
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,039
needs to needs to use more of their

839
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,640
direct higher authority which allows

840
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,080
them to uh

841
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,640
and lean into the uh the new cyber

842
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,720
talent management system that dhs

843
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,840
is piloting and systems within dod

844
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,880
where they can go out to a broader uh a

845
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,760
broader pool

846
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,399
and uh and and get more diverse

847
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,200
applicants

848
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,320
they can also do that by going to taking

849
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,520
their career fairs

850
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,320
outside the beltway and going into more

851
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,399
rural communities going to

852
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,799
uh you know historically black colleges

853
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,000
and universities

854
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,480
going to you know just just changing up

855
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
the traditional way in which they do

856
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,399
hiring

857
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,080
another question how best to engage

858
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,919
local officials and leaders to raise the

859
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,520
issue among local schools and

860
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,480
universities

861
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
how should we get our communities and

862
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,640
local business leaders involved

863
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,120
so i think that it we need to just have

864
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,720
continue to have these conversations

865
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,679
where we

866
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,480
uh where we talk about what is diversity

867
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,240
who is included like i

868
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
mentioned language diversity and there

869
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
are diverse individuals as well as

870
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,559
people of color

871
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,720
and women right we need to show them

872
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
where the benefit is we need to show

873
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
them why it's better

874
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,159
bring them some of those numbers some of

875
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,840
those statistics i mentioned

876
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,520
um show them that it can help their

877
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,240
um you know sort of help their business

878
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,520
it's not going to weaken

879
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,559
your talent pool it's going to

880
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,039
strengthen your talent pool plus

881
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,320
i mean we have so many so many uh

882
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,240
openings we're not going to be able to

883
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,080
fill them with our existing workforce

884
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,520
that just tells you that you need to

885
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
broaden the workforce and you need to

886
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,399
bring in

887
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,360
new people from a new pipeline right um

888
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,000
you know

889
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,960
use the use the existing uh processes

890
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
that we have that connect schools to

891
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,640
boot camps and universities

892
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,679
and uh the business community use that

893
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,120
whole system

894
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,919
uh in a more intertwined way so that you

895
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:54,960
are

896
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,039
broaden it right broaden it and and

897
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,000
connect

898
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,440
uh connect smart uh capable

899
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,480
uh students at an earlier age

900
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,200
into internships and things like that

901
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,320
all right any final thoughts

902
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,919
i just you know i think that this is

903
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,960
a much bigger problem than anyone is

904
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,440
thinks that it is uh they're but what

905
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,279
what always happens is this gets kind of

906
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,240
relegated to

907
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,320
a certain subset of people it's seen

908
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,919
sometimes as like you know

909
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,240
uh you know if you go down into the

910
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,200
workforce

911
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,159
uh role if you are talking about the

912
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,679
workforce if you're talking about that

913
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,799
in cyber security well

914
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,919
you're really like no you're just a

915
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,159
workforce person but it's

916
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,240
it's everybody for for people for

917
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
businesses uh for the federal government

918
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,279
honestly

919
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,799
um your people are your number one

920
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,760
resource

921
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
i've heard so many people so many

922
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,200
businesses say that

923
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,919
but yet they still are unwilling to make

924
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:56,399
the

925
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,159
investment and that's and put in the

926
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,559
time to really think about their hiring

927
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,200
processes

928
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
and and revamp things that have been in

929
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,200
place for the last 50 years

930
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,720
and so we need to do that and we need to

931
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,640
change our culture to really improve

932
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,440
uh diversity and to make uh make our

933
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,240
network secure

934
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,840
all right last shout out to your

935
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,480
initiative oh yes

936
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,159
uh check out making space on the

937
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,880
our street website rstreet.org and uh

938
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,159
all of the work that we're doing there

939
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:26,880
if any org

940
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,320
if anyone's out there that are that's

941
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
working at an organization that

942
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
is supportive of diversity and diversity

943
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,840
efforts it's not really that

944
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
that big a lift all we're suggesting is

945
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,600
that if you're hosting a panel or you're

946
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,720
hosting an event

947
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,279
in v invite at least one woman or one

948
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,679
person of color to speak on those panels

949
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,919
uh that it's a small step but i think it

950
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:46,720
you know

951
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
it's trying to move people in the right

952
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,519
direction so please come and join us in

953
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,159
our efforts

954
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,519
and thanks very much bryson for having

955
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,519
me on all right thank you tatiana

956
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,840
thank you it was fantastic what a way to

957
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,519
kick it off huh

958
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,600
yeah no really sets the tone again this

959
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,039
conference is about

960
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,480
bringing new voices to the table um and

961
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,600
one of the things i think that we do

962
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,679
that's a little special about that is

963
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,440
we're not just throwing them to the

964
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,039
wolves the proverbial wolves

965
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,480
we're pairing them with coaches so they

966
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,399
get somebody to help them

967
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,760
get over whatever they need you know

968
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,960
maybe there's something in the the

969
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,559
research maybe they're uncomfortable

970
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,519
presenting

971
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,679
maybe they just need somebody to make

972
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,880
them feel a little bit better about

973
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,039
going up on stage for that first time

974
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,840
and so that's i i think that's really um

975
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,279
what makes this conference special

976
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,240
and helps drive again the diversity of

977
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,760
voices that we need to

978
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,720
to look at these problems yeah and can i

979
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,519
