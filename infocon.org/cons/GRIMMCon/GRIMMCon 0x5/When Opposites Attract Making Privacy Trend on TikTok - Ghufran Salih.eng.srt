3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,240
you at grim con about my topic which is

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
when opposites attract making privacy

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,560
trend on tick tock

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
before we begin i just want to set the

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,160
expectations right off the bat

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
what this presentation is is a

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,000
demonstration of how tiktok can be used

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,040
to meet young people

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,960
where they are and spread privacy

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,000
literacy making sure that they're

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,920
staying safe and secure online

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,120
regardless of the apps that they're

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,559
using and how to be smarter about their

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,360
choices

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
what this presentation isn't is a

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,039
commentary on tick tock's

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,960
privacy and security concerns i as a

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640
privacy professional i'm well aware of

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,680
those concerns

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,920
i understand that there's a lot and it's

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
very complex and there is

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,199
a lot of issues that even i myself don't

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,800
understand but i want to focus this

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,480
presentation heavily on how i've been

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,239
able to utilize this platform

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,239
to be able to teach people a little bit

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,080
more about how to keep themselves safe

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,840
online

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,600
the you know you know i can make a whole

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
separate presentation about the privacy

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,920
concerns of tick tock um but a little

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,720
bit about me

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
um your presenter just so you know me

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,759

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
enthusiast i graduated

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,759
last year from syracuse university with

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,360
a degree in information management and

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,400
technology

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,040
i am an avid listener to pitbull songs

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,799
i'm actually a huge pitbull fan

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,360
um so that's why he is on here he's

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,960
actually a big part of my personality

46
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,560
and i just want all of you to know that

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,360
and i am also just a regular tech talk

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,000
user

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,720
and i i try not to use the word

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
influencer it's not my favorite word i'm

51
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
a creator and a very diligent user of

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,200
the app i have been able to pick up on

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
trends and dances and you know you know

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,799
what's what's the sound that everyone is

55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,600
using or

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,320
or what's the the the you know dance

57
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
that everyone is doing and

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,439
that's how you know you're a tick-tock

59
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,880
user is that you're able to keep up with

60
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,000
those trends even

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
though the app is so huge and there's so

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,520
many different sides to it like

63
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,280
i think at one point i was on lumberjack

64
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
tick tock and now i think i'm on like

65
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,720
i think i'm on prison tick tock actually

66
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,878
i don't know i just i it changes over

67
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,000
time and i think it also

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
um changes with my mood but um before

69
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
i you know had i started my current job

70
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,879
i was actually

71
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,879
interning at a financial institution

72
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,480
doing i.t for them so i didn't really

73
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,599
know anything about

74
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,440
privacy this is all kind of stuff that i

75
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,360
learned throughout the pandemic

76
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,239
in my first job and that actually is

77
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:30,959
kind of

78
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,599
rolls great into you know my my next

79
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,440
segment of this talk which is

80
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,080
how i got started so i was feeling

81
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
extremely overwhelmed i was

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
learning so much i was reading so much

83
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,319
about data privacy i was reading like

84
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,000
literal laws and policies and

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
regulations and trying to understand

86
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,080
what exactly we were looking for in data

87
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,519
privacy and one of my

88
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,200
escapes from that because i got

89
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,560
overwhelmed so quickly was

90
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,879
tick tock here's a little screen grab of

91
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,640
my for you page you can see i'm just

92
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,800
scrolling through and liking videos

93
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
i get the rogue video here and there so

94
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
don't mind me if i skip any videos but

95
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,760
i needed a space to be able to

96
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
creatively

97
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
kind of push out everything all the

98
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,800
knowledge that was in my mind because it

99
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
was building up to a point where i was

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,120
like this is

101
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
i can't handle this anymore so one

102
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
fateful sunday in august

103
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
i i posted my first tick tock and it

104
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
happened to be about data privacy and it

105
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,840
happened to blow up

106
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
and i used a popular sound i you know

107
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
talked a little bit about how to keep

108
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,879
yourself a little bit safer in your home

109
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,560
and when you're using your computer

110
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,680
and that tick tock blew up i

111
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,400
remember when peg talk was musically and

112
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,760
it was just filled with floppy-haired

113
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,200
boys who were lip-syncing

114
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
and i was blissfully unaware of any sort

115
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,799
of privacy concerns or

116
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,040
security concerns that tick-tock had or

117
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,840
even like of what ccpa cdpa

118
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,040
gdpr are i had no idea and now i was

119
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,879
spreading my knowledge on this app that

120
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,280
i loved so much

121
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,439
but that's the thing is that i because i

122
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,519
was a user i was able to be successful

123
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,159
in the app

124
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,640
so let me tell you a little bit about my

125
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
recipe for a viral tick tock and you

126
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,000
really only need

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,319
three things disclaimer this won't work

128
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,200
every time

129
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,280
the tick tock algorithm is a very fickle

130
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,399
thing sometimes

131
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,798
you know your most well thought out most

132
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,759
uh you know

133
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,519
well-researched videos don't do as well

134
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
as you want them to but that's okay

135
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
here are three things that you can do to

136
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,160
kind of boost your

137
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,400
tech talks if you do so choose to create

138
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,919
them i'm not saying you should

139
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
um so that you can reach more people so

140
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,600
the first thing i always use is a

141
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
trending sound or if i can use it if it

142
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
fits with the subject matter

143
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,240
i have to condense all of you know my

144
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
knowledge of data privacy into a 15

145
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
second to one minute video

146
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
and what helps what helps the algorithm

147
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,960
pick it up is a sound that's already

148
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,360
been

149
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,759
used by a lot of users it's just more

150
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,040
likely to be shown on

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,759
more for you pages trending sounds could

152
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
range from you know an audio

153
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
that from from an audio snippet from a

154
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,440
song to an audio snippet from a tick

155
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,639
tock that someone thought was really

156
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,360
funny

157
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,759
to anything it could really be anything

158
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
i think a car horn at some point was a

159
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,400
trending sound

160
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,560
pick a trending sound make sure it lines

161
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
up with what you want to convey

162
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,440
and use it the next thing is concise

163
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
fun facts you never want to get too

164
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
technical you never want to use

165
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
like large words or jargon that someone

166
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
might not understand i am my target

167
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,479
audience is

168
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,560
13 to 24 year olds i don't think they're

169
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
gonna know every single term that i use

170
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
as a privacy professional so

171
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
keep it high level and encourage

172
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
conversation in the comments i think

173
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,199
that that was my biggest thing is that

174
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,720
i would talk about something at a very

175
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,320
high level very rudimentary so that

176
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,520
everyone was able to get it

177
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,639
and then i would get questions in the

178
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,800
comments and i'd be able to engage

179
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,520
the last thing a sense of humor i think

180
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
i have a great sense of humor

181
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,199
not everyone thinks them i think i do

182
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,639
but tick tock is all about having fun

183
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,000
and sharing laughs

184
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,039
um and you just need to

185
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,840
let go of any sort of seriousness so

186
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
that people can see that you know

187
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
yes you're a privacy professional or a

188
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,400
security professional but you can have

189
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
fun you can talk about the subject in a

190
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,880
way that's

191
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
fun and and engaging and you're really

192
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,240
able to understand

193
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,319
it um so if you bring humor into it

194
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,919
you're golden i'm pretty sure

195
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,600
you know they'll respond well to it i i

196
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
think they have for me i

197
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
maybe maybe maybe not i don't know who

198
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
knows really

199
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,960
so i actually want to go into an

200
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,520
analysis of a couple of my most favorite

201
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,240
tick tocks

202
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,319
so this was the first tick tock that is

203
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,440
not the first two talk that i've ever

204
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,000
posted

205
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,280
but it was the first tick tock that went

206
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,680
viral it has 700 at this point

207
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,400
it has 798 600 views two hundred and

208
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
forty eight thousand

209
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,319
uh 800 likes and 763 comments

210
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:49,840
so i will go ahead and play it

211
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,360
so let me let me explain um so the audio

212
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,759
while

213
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,240
inappropriate um was actually trending

214
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,759
that day i think i saw four or five

215
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,199
back-to-back videos that

216
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
used this audio and the whole premise of

217
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,120
the trend was to introduce yourself to

218
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
your friend or your significant other's

219
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,520
parent and talk about what you can bring

220
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,199
to the table and obviously i had to talk

221
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,000
about my mad

222
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,960
privacy skills or my mad security skills

223
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,800
these are so basic i'm sure that for

224
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,319
all of you who are seasoned

225
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,919
professionals this is all

226
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,560
kitty play but i was trying to talk to

227
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,319
young people who might not know

228
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,240
what a password manager is who might not

229
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
know that they should be muting or

230
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,280
turning off their alexa these are all

231
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,080
things that you know we

232
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,440
don't really think about at least as

233
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,880
teenagers i never really thought about

234
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,360
it

235
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,000
but i wanted to bring it into this so i

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,599
had a trending sound

237
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,720
and in the comments i started to get so

238
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,120
many

239
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,160
questions so many like just

240
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,520
questions about you know how what

241
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
password manager should i use what else

242
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,560
could i be doing should i cover my

243
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,360
webcam

244
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
i started a conversation with this one

245
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,039
video where i used a trending sound and

246
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,240
i was smiling

247
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,360
and i used very short

248
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
actions that people could do on a daily

249
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,199
basis and so i think that that's why

250
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,000
this video got

251
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
picked up could be for another reason

252
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
that i might not know of some people

253
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
might like that scarf i'm wearing it

254
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
right now i quite like it so it could be

255
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,120
the scarf but

256
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,960
pretty sure it had something to do with

257
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,639
just keeping it simple

258
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,240
keeping it fun and teaching people

259
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,599
something and that's what these videos

260
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,599
are about

261
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,360
oh it's playing it again let me go ahead

262
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
and skip it

263
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
so my next video this one was a little

264
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
bit more well researched well thought

265
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:35,919
out

266
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,120
uh and it had 69 200 views

267
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,479
18 100 likes and 163 comments this one

268
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,760
the premise of this one was just talking

269
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,159
about

270
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
the different data privacy regulations

271
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,839
that exist worldwide and i

272
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,160
you will see that i brought a lot of

273
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,839
humor into this one

274
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,120
so let's talk about this video i

275
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,480
actually did a lot of research on this

276
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
one because i was already reading data

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,480
privacy regulations for my job so i

278
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
kind of had it fresh in my mind of what

279
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
the privacy policies were

280
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,720
and what i thought of them um granted

281
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,680
this was a long

282
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
this was a while ago i think this was

283
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
back in october so i i've grown since

284
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
then a little bit and i would change my

285
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,480
ratings just a little bit

286
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,399
but as you can see i used it's a really

287
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,320
fun song funkytown it wasn't quite

288
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,760
trending but a lot of people did use it

289
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,399
as background

290
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,680
music i was i thought i was funny maybe

291
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
i don't know i

292
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,880
referred to the us as girly pop which i

293
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,399
don't think i will ever do again

294
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,160
however a lot of people did respond well

295
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,560
to it um i kind of incorporated that

296
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
humor of like what what are you doing or

297
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:36,880
like

298
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,399
amazing show stopping incredible like

299
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,920
these are all like

300
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,720
memes and trends and and and vernacular

301
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,839
that is used by

302
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,519
young people and i incorporated that

303
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,040
because it's actually stuff that i use

304
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
on a daily basis

305
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,079
um and i you know it was well researched

306
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,200
about that i didn't do as well as the

307
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,240
other video just because i think that

308
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,519
this one was a little bit more long form

309
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,959
this one was a minute long

310
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,959
and longer videos tend not to do as well

311
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,000
on tick tock just because

312
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you know it's you wanna just you know

313
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
see a video like it be done with it see

314
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
a video like it be done with it

315
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,079
um so i really enjoyed this video i

316
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:08,880
think that

317
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
making it was great because i got to

318
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,079
learn something but also started a

319
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,440
conversation i had people in the

320
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,959
comments asking about their own

321
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,760
countries

322
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,839
asking why i gave readings you know they

323
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,440
wanted to know where they could read up

324
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,800
on it a little bit more what their

325
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
individual rights were so

326
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
it got people thinking like it's the

327
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,399
whole purpose of this video was to get

328
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,079
people talking about their

329
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,079
data privacy laws in their countries

330
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,000
it's not about what i thought

331
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,160
even though i thought what i thought is

332
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,360
great even though it's just my

333
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,959
so it's my opinion i'm a little biased

334
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,200
but you know it's

335
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,959
i wanted to have people start

336
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,800
questioning their own countries and

337
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,320
their own states and their own cities

338
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,360
and be like well what

339
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
what's what's here and what can i know

340
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,640
about it and what can i do

341
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,079
and so that was something really cool

342
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,120
that i was able to do

343
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
and then my last video that i'm going to

344
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,519
talk about is

345
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,880
a actually it's about password manager

346
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
so this one was a little bit more fun to

347
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
film i was just dancing there's not

348
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,600
really a lot of talking it's mostly just

349
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,160
like

350
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,839
title text so let's take a look this one

351
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,600
had 22 900 views

352
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:25,839
3651 likes and 102 comments

353
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,200
this was one of my favorites to film and

354
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,680
actually one of my favorites to edit

355
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,600
i saw that a lot of people were using

356
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
shake it by metro station which is the

357
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,399
song that was just played

358
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,000
to dance they just were dancing to it

359
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,440
just having fun letting loose so that's

360
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,720
what i did i mean i jumped on the bed at

361
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
some point which i probably shouldn't

362
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,720
have done

363
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,360
um but it was it was a fun time for me

364
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,720
um a lot of people were using sound

365
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,320
today and so it was trending a lot

366
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
you know the algorithm was picking it up

367
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
and showing it to more people because

368
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,079
the more you like sounds

369
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,680
the videos with that sound the more it

370
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
pops up on your 4u page i know that from

371
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,560
personal experience

372
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,839
and i thought it was a really cool way

373
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,839
to show off the importance of a password

374
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,560
manager

375
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,240
while also showing off my sick dance

376
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,079
moves you know i i was

377
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,240
concise i didn't you know they were not

378
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,839
very long like three lines

379
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
per caption and move on you want to keep

380
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,480
it short you want to keep it sweet and

381
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,680
then there was a call to action at the

382
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,240
end where

383
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,680
here are some of my favorites that you

384
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,440
can look into and here are their prices

385
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,959
these are free these are paid

386
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,440
and that is how you know in the comments

387
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,720
the majority of the comments they were

388
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
just asking me what i thought which ones

389
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,480
that i use which ones i recommend

390
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,040
um and why i recommended them and it was

391
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,639
another way to start a conversation

392
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,160
and that's what these tick tocks are for

393
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
is to at least for my brand for my

394
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,720
purposes

395
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,560
is to start a conversation and to get

396
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
people to want to learn more

397
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
and i think that you know through these

398
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,279
three videos and also the rest of the

399
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,800
videos on my page

400
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
i was able to do that and it was so much

401
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,440
fun so cool i got to learn a new skill

402
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,320
like how to effectively communicate my

403
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,079
facts my very technical

404
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,639
or very legal filled facts to young

405
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,079
people to people who might not

406
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,440
understand these facts

407
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,440
um and be able to start a conversation

408
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,160
you know so to end it

409
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,079
what started as a way to show my friends

410
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,399
what i was learning at my job in a fun

411
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
and creative way

412
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,199
it turned into creating content that was

413
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,160
accessible

414
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,880
informative and started a conversation

415
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,000
i'm honored to be able

416
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
to use this app and to teach people to

417
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
be more diligent about what they share

418
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,880
online

419
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,199
privacy is and will always be one of the

420
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,639
most important things to us

421
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,480
as people as citizens we are granted our

422
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,240
rights through our privacy regulations

423
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,279
and as someone who has been the victim

424
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,920
of you know sharing too much online and

425
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
seeing the consequences of that whether

426
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
that be through falling for scams or

427
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
or just general kid mean stuff

428
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,440
i had to learn and i want to be able to

429
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,839
use this platform to let people learn

430
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,680
this isn't perfect by a long shot what i

431
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,920
do is different and i still am learning

432
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,440
and growing as you can see from one of

433
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,480
the comments from be

434
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,800
more slight correction very slight but

435
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,920
it was a good correction it was

436
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,360
something that i needed to know

437
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,279
so that i can continue to make these

438
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,600
tick tocks and make them better

439
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,279
i enjoy this and i think that it is

440
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,959
something that should be used more

441
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,279
by privacy and security professionals it

442
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,399
doesn't have to be on tick tock you

443
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,519
don't have to use the platform if you

444
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,399
don't believe in it

445
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,639
but i think that if you are passionate

446
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,000
about teaching people how about how to

447
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
protect themselves or if you're

448
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
passionate about cyber security

449
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,880
there is a way to communicate that to

450
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,279
get people to be more excited about it

451
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,759
i have had so much fun and i'm so glad

452
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
that people want to stay on cyber

453
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,800
security tick tock or want to stay on

454
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,480
data privacy tick tock

455
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,959
it has made my life filled with color

456
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,839
because you know

457
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,079
again this field is very it's a lot it's

458
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,440
draining at times and it

459
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,759
can make you feel like oh there's dead

460
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,120
end to this i don't know what i'm gonna

461
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,920
do but

462
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,000
moments like these comments like these

463
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,959
make it worth it

464
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,279
so i hope that you've learned something

465
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,000
