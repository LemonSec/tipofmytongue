1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,519
all right

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,000
thanks folks hey everybody um those of

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,560
you that are on the call i'm excited to

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,199
share some ics and ot specific stuff

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:21,760
with you

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,880
let me minimize this screen um my name

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,080
is vivek ponoda

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,800
and here's a quick background of who i

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,920
am

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,000
i've been in industrial control systems

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,840
all my life

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
in fact right after high school i became

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
a technician instrument technician

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,079
and i graduated with electrical degree

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,280
later on but

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,280
i've been doing ics all my work life

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,960
i've been doing ot cyber security for

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,719
the past eight plus years

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,360
uh most of the past ten years has been

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,600
sales and business development

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
i do a double bit on the services and

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
execution

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
uh and and like many of you um in the

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,559
industry that i've been around for a

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,280
while

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,719
i've traveled and worked in many

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,360
countries um i do have a finance

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
uh mba as well and as handset for

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,040
industrial controls

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,400
here's my contact info and let's dig

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,720
into the agenda today

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
so um we'll talk a little bit about the

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,920
industrial control systems the plc's

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,320
i will talk more about the top 20 plc

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
coding practices project

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,839
and we'll go through some examples

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,360
so um first up plc's folks

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,759
nobody is uh surprised to see purdue

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
model here

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
most of the discussion that you see

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
around industrial controls

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,159
typically starts off with saying um how

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,680
do you protect

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,119
the internet facing devices right so

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,040
anything in the dmz at this phase you

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
know level three about

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,840
or maybe even the hmis and historians

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,960
and ews at this level two or three

49
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,640
even down to level two hmis but

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,439
you don't hear about securely doing

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,320
anything

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,840
at this level one or below because

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,800
historically there was no

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,080
protection no focus on security at this

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,239
level one or below

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,959
so in fact you hear about this term

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,760
insecure by design because these plcs

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
uh you know both the hardware and the

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,920
protocols the communication protocols

60
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,239
were never built with security in mind

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,280
so

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,080
if an attacker a malicious actor is in

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,480
this

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,360
area already you know having done

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,080
whatever

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,640
in a lateral movement or direct access

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,800
through some kind of iot device

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
either way once they're here they can

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,400
operate no different

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
from a maintenance person or operator

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,840
because

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
you know the protocols they'll just

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,120
execute whatever commands are given

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
right so they don't really

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
look into you know who's doing the

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,800
initiation of a command

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
so historically again you know no

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
encryption authentication etc

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,640
now we talk about plcs but you know what

80
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,319
i'm going to talk about today is equally

81
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,599
applicable for

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,000
distributed control systems or in other

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,680
scanning systems as well

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,280
we're just talking about the level one

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,680
controllers okay

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
all right so next up is the um

87
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
background on this top 20 project so a

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
couple years ago at s4

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,800
now which is a ot specific uh thought

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
leadership kind of cyber security

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
conference

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,920
happens every year in january in miami

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,400
um

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
jake brosky did a presentation talking

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,680
about how

96
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,920
there are things we could do at level

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,519
one there are things that we could do to

98
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,640
improve the

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,840
security of plcs uh you know have a

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,560
better

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
posture security posture and also be

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,640
able to

103
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,680
help in case there is an issue and then

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
help in forensics and insulin response

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,519
he did this presentation

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,319
um and then post that a lot of people

107
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,120
felt like

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
they should be developed further you

109
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,480
know beyond a presentation

110
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,239
to get like a list that the community

111
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,000
can actually use so

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
um they then registered on you know an

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,680
isa

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,799
website uh and and solicited people to

115
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,519
contribute

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,360
a lot of thousand people you know

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,640
register and

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
several dozens actually contributed for

119
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
the next year and

120
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,600
after a year we now have this pdf file

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,000
ready that has the top 20 practices

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,560
i'll post this link again in the discord

123
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,360
channel but

124
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,680
you can download this there is no need

125
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,400
to register

126
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,479
just download it and use it as you as

127
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,000
you see fit

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
but these practices are written for

129
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,240
engineers these are not written for

130
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
ot practitioners of course ot

131
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,160
practitioners

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,080
you know could use this and pass it on

133
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
to the engineers but the key

134
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,840
reason why we did that was we wanted to

135
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,120
to improve the coding

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
of the plc's themselves right so these

137
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,199
engineers are recording these uh control

138
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,000
systems

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,120
are whom this is targeted towards the

140
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
goals are you know obviously to make the

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,280
plc chord a little bit more robust

142
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,160
or at least less vulnerable also you

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,680
know use some of these mechanisms you

144
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
know built-in redundancy

145
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,400
you know software um coding build up

146
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
uh some kind of fallback mechanisms and

147
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
also you know improve the secure by

148
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
design mechanism

149
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,479
and then assistant documentation and

150
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,479
logging etc you know when you get to

151
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,039
an instant response kind of situation so

152
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,880
we mapped all these practices as much as

153
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,720
possible to the minor attack framework

154
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,840
for ics

155
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,199
cwe you know isa standards 62443

156
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,199
as you would expect right so that way

157
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
you know we are following industry

158
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,199
standards and frameworks

159
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,600
but this list is essentially a practices

160
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,160
list it's not a standard by itself

161
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,960
um also it adds a layer of protection in

162
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,000
places that

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,360
not existed before so thereby

164
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,840
the plc code itself will be less error

165
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,479
prone

166
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,600
and makes it harder for an attacker to

167
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,199
accomplish what they were trying to

168
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,400
that's the goal you know one of the

169
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,199
goals behind this project

170
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,120
uh let's get into this list so we have

171
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
these 20 items here

172
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,479
we're going to take a few examples and

173
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,240
elaborate them a little bit more

174
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,120
but i just wanted to pause just for a

175
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,479
second here so you can see

176
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,520
the list of top 20 practices again like

177
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
i mentioned i'll provide the link you

178
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,319
can download this

179
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,160
with more detail there it's like a 40

180
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,360
page document

181
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,400
that has all these different practices

182
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
and explains in detail with some

183
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,080
examples

184
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,560
all right let's take let's go into uh

185
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
this list with a simple one first so

186
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,039
one of the practices practice number two

187
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,360
talks about tracking operating modes

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,759
so those of you that are very familiar

189
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,600
with industrial control systems

190
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
you know i'm showing a plc here you know

191
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,720
with some i o

192
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,240
and some power supply as you can see

193
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
you have a switch here that typically

194
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
has multiple modes

195
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,919
one of them happens to be one the other

196
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,280
one would be typically

197
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,960
program and maybe remote so

198
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,759
the idea being uh when in run mode the

199
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
code is being executed by the plc

200
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,639
when it's in a program mode you're able

201
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,560
to download code to the controller

202
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,199
and when it's in remote you can then

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
choose whether to program or

204
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,520
run you know from a distance via

205
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,039
software

206
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,199
so the guidance here from this practice

207
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,240
is to say that

208
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,560
you know keep the plc in run mode and if

209
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
it's not in one mode it should be an

210
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
alarm to the operator

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,080
and you know again at the end of the

212
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,199
shift uh

213
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,360
make sure the alarm pops back up because

214
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,680
if someone were working on this plc

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,599
um the operator would know right and

216
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
they would acknowledge it and then

217
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,120
end of the shift maybe they close the

218
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
permit out and then you know enable the

219
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,360
plc to go back to run mode

220
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,319
now there are reasons why it's typically

221
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,759
left in remote

222
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,360
because you know this might be in a

223
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
hazardous area

224
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
the engineer might need to put on the

225
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,520
coveralls and hard hat and safety boots

226
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,840
and to get to this area to

227
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,360
you know drive even further out

228
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,039
somewhere remote to to

229
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,440
access the switch or maybe call a buddy

230
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,960
operator and ask them to

231
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
you know put this in a program or when

232
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,479
they need to

233
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
but the key is you know the malicious

234
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
attacker doesn't have the body operator

235
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,160
doesn't have the access to the plc right

236
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,440
so we're trying to avoid

237
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
the risk of this being in remote and

238
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,720
someone over the network being able to

239
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,599
move the plc into program mode and

240
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,599
download stuff or cause any just

241
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,319
you know disturbance to the operation so

242
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
the recommendation is to

243
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
you know keep this in run mode and

244
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,719
always

245
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,760
alert via an alarm on the hmi

246
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,240
if it's not a number now you might ask

247
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
the question you know there are some

248
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
plcs out there that do not have a switch

249
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,720
so what about that

250
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,839
again the goal of this practice is to um

251
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,279
kind of give you an example of what

252
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,959
we're thinking or collectively

253
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,600
ot practitioners or cyber security focus

254
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
folks are thinking

255
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,399
uh you might have to find alternate

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,839
mechanisms right they might be a

257
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
password that you can um

258
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,880
put to avoid download or some other way

259
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,920
to track

260
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
you know whether the plc is in a mode

261
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,279
that is not running

262
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,200
it is uh you know able to download to

263
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
the controller that's what we're trying

264
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
to avoid

265
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,600
or i learned at the very least okay

266
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,080
next step is uh practice five another uh

267
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,360
pretty straightforward one

268
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
uh you know you you might see a trend

269
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,880
here that some of these things might

270
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,360
seem like common sense for ite folks

271
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,480
but then we're in the ot world where

272
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,200
our common sense is different our what

273
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,600
we

274
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
what we developed uh code for

275
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,839
programming for

276
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,800
is for process functionality and

277
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,680
efficiency

278
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,480
and reliability not so much for um

279
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,200
security

280
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
so again this practice talks about using

281
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,519
a cryptographic hash

282
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,519
or a checksum to verify the integrity of

283
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,120
the plc code

284
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,000
now some plc's do have a checksum

285
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,640
feature

286
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
where they automatically generate a

287
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
checksum and you you can save it

288
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
maybe you can even put it on a register

289
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,160
and alarm it if it if it changes but if

290
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,760
you don't have that feature

291
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,120
you can still perform the checksum

292
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
pretty easily on the engineering

293
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,120
workstation

294
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
right or you can probably do a hash in

295
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,480
the ews

296
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,560
of the binary that you just downloaded

297
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,839
so you know that

298
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,160
it's the one true code that you are in

299
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,320
control of and no one messed with it

300
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,279
so most plc's can't generate or or check

301
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:23,920
hashes

302
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
on their own so you have to do that from

303
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
the engineering workstation

304
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
so again the key is to ensure that

305
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,519
you're able to verify the integrity of

306
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
the code okay

307
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,240
next up is uh practice seven again i'm

308
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,600
just going through some of the examples

309
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,120
so that you get a feel for what these

310
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,320
plc practices

311
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,200
are are doing right this happens to be

312
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
one of my favorite

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,560
ones where it says validate an alert for

314
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,079
paired inputs and outputs

315
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,720
so the way we define these paired inputs

316
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,680
are

317
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,279
these are things that physically cannot

318
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,040
happen at the same time so

319
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,600
as an example a valve cannot be open or

320
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
closed at the same time right

321
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
or a motor wouldn't have a start or a

322
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,279
stop command

323
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,320
and a stop command at the same time so

324
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,120
um that way if a malicious attacker is

325
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,079
trying to just

326
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,640
you know mess with or mess with inputs

327
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
you should have a mechanism to say

328
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,399
this is physically not possible right so

329
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,600
these two signals

330
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,519
shouldn't be coming in at the same time

331
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,120
now they might be coming because of a

332
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,880
limit switch fault or

333
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
some kind of mcc failure but having this

334
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,360
alert kind of tells you that there's

335
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
something going on out in the field that

336
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
you need to inspect for or troubleshoot

337
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,959
right that's the idea

338
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,519
now um you know if possible i'm using a

339
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,120
ladder logic example here you know

340
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
typically you have this motor

341
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,160
start command if it goes away then it's

342
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,440
stopped right

343
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,920
but what we're saying here is configure

344
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
start and stop

345
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,200
separately if at all possible that way

346
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
it's two different

347
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,279
outputs going to the mcc and if the mcc

348
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,000
is able to take

349
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
those two separate inputs from motor

350
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,079
start and stop that's ideal

351
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,560
and then disallow the rapid change of

352
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,240
output states meaning

353
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,959
uh if some malicious attacker is able to

354
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,399
just force this motor stop or stop um

355
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,120
on and off on and off right you should

356
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,480
have some kind of software

357
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,880
time out or something that disables the

358
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,680
output

359
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,600
uh you know from being toggled pretty

360
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,440
quickly now

361
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,720
you might ask the question you know

362
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
wouldn't the attacker then find

363
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,639
go back in logic and check where that's

364
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,320
being stopped and overwrite it

365
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,560
yes it's possible but again the key is

366
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,079
we're trying to improve

367
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,440
the code right we're trying to increase

368
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,279
the robustness of the code not

369
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,200
necessarily mitigate every single

370
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
possible attack scenario but make it

371
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,240
harder for the attacker make them

372
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
read the code even further than they

373
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,519
already did

374
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,399
so far or not able to just randomly

375
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,120
toggle

376
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
outputs or bits from a modbus access

377
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,639
they have on the network

378
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
for example all right let's go into

379
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,320
another

380
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,800
um slightly more detailed one so this is

381
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,079
uh

382
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,560
validated inputs based on flaws you know

383
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
the physical plausibility

384
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,639
this is actually cool because you know

385
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,800
plc gets a lot of inputs right it gets

386
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,200
uh

387
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
you know not only the process inputs it

388
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,279
gets all the pressures temperatures

389
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,880
limits retweet back many things right um

390
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,440
so if you monitor the expected physical

391
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,079
duration

392
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,320
as an example there's a valve and it

393
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
takes a certain amount of time to go

394
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,320
from

395
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,200
fully closed to fully open or a tank

396
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
with a certain fluid

397
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,880
uh takes it in time to you know either

398
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,440
completely drain or completely fill up

399
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
you got to have a good feel for what

400
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,680
these numbers are in a usual process

401
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,720
scenario

402
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,560
and then alert when they're different

403
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
right so if someone was

404
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,199
attacking the bits maliciously or

405
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,680
manipulating the transmitter

406
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,720
signal the 420 milliamp signal or you

407
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,839
know coming from

408
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,959
level three below and i just uh modify

409
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,440
some

410
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,639
packets or or you know replay attack of

411
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,360
using some

412
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,680
past inputs to to force inputs currently

413
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,000
if you track if you track this physical

414
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,760
duration of what it should be currently

415
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,959
in this process

416
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,560
and if it's different if you get an

417
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
alert that's a good way to kind of find

418
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,120
out if

419
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,720
something is wrong with the process or

420
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,320
if someone is manipulating it

421
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,160
right similarly you know monitor

422
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,600
expected the physical

423
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,920
repeating activity so some of these uh

424
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,519
waste water treatment plants have a

425
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,279
diurnal cycle where

426
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,800
uh you know some things happen in the

427
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,720
morning some things happen at night

428
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,959
now if whatever should happen in the

429
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,880
morning is happening at night

430
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,120
that's atypical right again alert based

431
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,639
on the alarm based on that so the

432
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,800
operator has an idea

433
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,360
and the last one uh if you all remember

434
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,199
the most recent oldsmar

435
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,720
florida uh hop where someone

436
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,279
not only used a remote access to to log

437
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,079
in

438
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,160
which is a traditional ite vulnerability

439
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,839
that we all know no remote access

440
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,800
credentials

441
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
stolen credentials but they were also

442
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,160
able to

443
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,360
um enter a value for lie you know which

444
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,000
was ten

445
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,639
tens of thousands of times more than you

446
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,320
know what the actual

447
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
uh life percentage should be right now

448
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,600
if you limit the operator entry for set

449
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,279
points to what is practical and

450
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,040
physically possible

451
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,959
that wouldn't happen right now there are

452
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,880
many mitigations so some of the

453
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,639
practices some of the other practices

454
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,800
also have other medications for the

455
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,120
remote access for example or

456
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
some of the validation and checks on the

457
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,880
plc code but in this particular case

458
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,519
the key is to allow for example let's

459
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,079
say

460
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
the whole process can only take five

461
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,519
percent

462
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,639
lie safely in an hour you should only

463
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,160
let the operator enter

464
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,399
up to that five percent right you

465
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,720
shouldn't just because there is a number

466
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,680
on the hmi that they can enter um

467
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
shouldn't be the reason why they have

468
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,880
a chance to enter 10 or 20 so that what

469
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,839
that avoids

470
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,800
mistakes being made at the same time um

471
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,759
disallows the

472
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,680
malicious attacker you know accessing

473
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,839
the same input from anywhere else

474
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,680
and entering a number that's not

475
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,880
physically possible

476
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
okay that's another cool way to kind of

477
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,399
mitigate some of the external threats

478
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,720
uh this is another interesting example

479
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,320
where you trap

480
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,360
false negatives and false positives for

481
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,560
critical alerts

482
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,880
you wouldn't do this for all alerts but

483
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,800
uh let me walk into a scenario

484
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,920
so let's say this is uh

485
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,399
um you know obviously we have many kinds

486
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,000
of programming languages right so we

487
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,240
have function block we have ladder logic

488
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,839
uh this could be a function block

489
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,600
example where you have a bunch of

490
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,639
conditions

491
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,480
and they all have to be true to get this

492
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
trigger bit as one

493
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,399
okay and this trigger bit one can then

494
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
go on and do other things maybe start

495
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,839
stops and bumps

496
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,440
uh you know do some other activity in

497
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,720
the plc but what if a malicious attacker

498
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,519
was

499
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,079
uh forcing this trigger bit to zero on

500
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,600
purpose right so that the rest of the

501
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,399
actions

502
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,440
or the sequence doesn't happen so

503
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,199
in this example we're trying to create

504
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,760
an alert for this kind of false negative

505
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,880
right so this is

506
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,959
supposed to be one but someone uh

507
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,799
maliciously forced it to zero

508
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,799
so if you build an additional piece of

509
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,000
logic where you

510
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,119
actually take the output of the same and

511
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,079
gate here

512
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,880
and then take a knot of this trigger bit

513
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,199
that was force in our example

514
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,480
and then and it to get this alarm

515
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
uh in a forced condition you know this

516
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,520
would be zero

517
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
that means this would be one and this is

518
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,919
already one so you then get this alert

519
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,400
that

520
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,799
hey there is a false negative happening

521
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,559
on this particular trigger bit

522
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,880
okay you can do something similar for a

523
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,400
false positive as well

524
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,679
again the key is you know

525
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,440
we're trying to add another layer of

526
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,039
protection where

527
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,559
you could make an argument that an

528
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
attacker would not only force this but

529
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,919
also force this

530
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,400
that's possible definitely but this code

531
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
normally doesn't exist right so many of

532
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
these things that we're recommending

533
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
in these practices list you know based

534
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,919
on a lot of experience over

535
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,200
many years by many um plc engineers and

536
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,559
practitioners is that

537
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,360
the more robust you build a code and

538
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
more

539
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
kind of checks you built in uh the more

540
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,440
difficult it is for a malicious attacker

541
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,919
to just

542
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,320
randomly get lucky and be able to

543
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,440
manipulate something

544
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,840
so this false negative will alert you

545
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,799
that you know

546
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,440
someone is forcing this bit on purpose

547
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,840
next up we have several practices that i

548
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,679
kind of combined to say

549
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,400
these are kind of similar where you

550
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,360
monitor

551
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
whereas the previous practices we talked

552
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,160
about were all about verifying integrity

553
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,200
um some of these practices are more for

554
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,520
monitoring so for example let's take

555
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,840
this first one plc cycle time

556
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,080
i'm using this example here where you

557
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,679
know the plc cycle time is

558
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,240
fairly predictable right because it's a

559
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,799
deterministic

560
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,480
computer the process

561
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,000
is fairly stable the ios

562
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,160
and everything that's being scanned you

563
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,080
know there'll be minor variation but

564
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
let's say there's a spike in this it's

565
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,520
uh possible that

566
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,440
someone injected some malicious code

567
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
that acts once in a while and

568
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,320
causes more cpu cycle time uh if you

569
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,919
trend it on the hdmi

570
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,960
then you know over time what's normal

571
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
and what's not right so most plcs of the

572
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,240
cycle time

573
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,280
allowed to be a trendable point

574
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,240
defined point but most hmis don't have

575
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
this information so the recommendation

576
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,480
here is to do that so that you can track

577
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,640
it so the operator has a better view for

578
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,679
what's what's normal and what's abnormal

579
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,880
same thing with plc hard stops if a plc

580
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,320
ever

581
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,559
you know does a reset or reboot you

582
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
should be able to log that and record it

583
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,840
um and also plc uptime it's kind of like

584
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,559
the um

585
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,440
alternate for the hard stop right so uh

586
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
when was the last time the plc started

587
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,919
and how long has it been running

588
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,200
again that should be something that

589
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,960
should be logged

590
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
and same thing with the memory usage so

591
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,600
the plc memory usage is fairly constant

592
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,520
fairly stable

593
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,840
and if it's changing for a reason it's

594
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,640
likely that

595
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120
someone is messing with um out of the

596
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,000
code

597
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,159
or it might be something wrong with the

598
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,159
device itself or something else wrong in

599
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,760
the system

600
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,400
these monitoring ideas or these

601
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,520
practices

602
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
are crucial during instant response

603
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,679
because oftentimes

604
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,480
you know you walk into a plant after an

605
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,360
incident

606
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,559
and you have no idea what's

607
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,480
actually normal what's good for the

608
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
process what's expected

609
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,080
what's not expected but if you're able

610
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,159
to log and trend them on the hmi and

611
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,000
then even store them on the

612
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
workstation or on the on the historian

613
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,919
you then have a way to kind of verify

614
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,360
you know some of the previous practices

615
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,000
we talked about

616
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,840
verifying the code and validating the

617
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,919
integrity of the binary that you

618
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,520
downloaded the code to then to the

619
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
controller

620
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,440
and if you assist this with this kind of

621
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
data to say this is normal

622
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
and you know whatever is happening now

623
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,880
is not normal so

624
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,360
if you have the comparison then you know

625
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,200
you can really do a better

626
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,159
insulin response because you have a good

627
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,720
feel for what's what's normal

628
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,799
what's up normal um

629
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,919
this project is ongoing it's evolving um

630
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,840
the version one that's published on the

631
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,480
plc

632
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,440
hyphen security.com website we're always

633
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
looking for more contributors we're

634
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,320
looking for more people to get involved

635
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,799
in the project

636
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,039
if you are an ot practitioner i would

637
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,960
request that you

638
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,039
pass on this information to your ics

639
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,480
engineers people that you're working

640
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,799
with

641
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,720
across the plant floor or in

642
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
headquarters

643
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,159
and you yourself can contribute to the

644
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,640
project along with those ics engineers

645
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,480
either with the plc knowledge or you

646
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
know any of the standards work

647
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,960
uh the isa ise 62443 or the cwe

648
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
uh we are in we're seeing a lot more

649
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,559
people interested in

650
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,720
uh natively improving the functionality

651
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
on the level one devices

652
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,520
you know the more recent devices have

653
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
some kind of built-in encryption they

654
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,600
have more authentication options but

655
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,720
these practices are meant for

656
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,919
even older plc so if you

657
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,840
invest a little bit of time you'll be

658
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,679
able to improve the security posture

659
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,919
and help insulin response on even older

660
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,799
plcs

661
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,440
with these practices but the key is to

662
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,039
educate these clients you know our

663
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,840
customers

664
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
your customers and the existence of

665
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,440
these coding practices

666
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,360
these did not exist before right so if

667
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,559
someone asked you

668
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,360
hey how could i better defend level one

669
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
you didn't have a good answer but now

670
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,799
these practices exist and you can pass

671
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,320
them all this document

672
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,760
similarly you know if you're buying

673
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,720
something new in the ot world

674
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
don't restrict yourself to level two or

675
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,600
about

676
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,280
requirements right those you know

677
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,320
coming from i.t a lot of

678
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,880
it-like requirements are being passed on

679
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
to ot you know whether it's about

680
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,559
patching or virtual

681
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,080
computers a lot of uh relatively

682
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,320
recent developments in the ote world

683
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,159
i've been restricted to the level to and

684
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,400
about you know learning from my team but

685
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
pass on these requirements you know

686
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
don't just give them this document to

687
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,000
say

688
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,360
follow these because this is not a

689
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,000
standard but the concepts behind these

690
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,039
practices

691
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,520
uh please pass on this document to them

692
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,799
giving them the

693
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,799
the background that it's the intent

694
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,480
behind these practices here's what we're

695
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,600
trying to defend

696
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,919
and here are some of the examples of how

697
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:50,799
you do it in

698
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,440
an allen bradley plc or a triconics or a

699
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,799
gplc

700
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,799
so uh put them in the vendor rfqs and

701
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,600
ask for more security at level one and

702
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,400
look forward to

703
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,919
answering any questions that you might

704
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,559
have that's the end of

705
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,440
my presentation

706
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,760
awesome whenever i hear about

707
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,080
plc's it always just brings me back to

708
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,120
like darknet diaries talks of like

709
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,840
uber apt hacks and stuff like that it's

710
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,200
the first thing

711
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,880
that comes to mind i can't remember the

712
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
episode but i literally just listened to

713
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,279
it

714
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,200
uh how did you get into this type of

715
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,440
security originally

716
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,039
so uh my background is industrial

717
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,559
control systems back when

718
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,000
i started i was a controls

719
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,600
instrumentation technician

720
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,159
so there was no security focus like 20

721
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,760
years ago right because we just

722
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,520
did everything based on functionality

723
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,400
reliability how to get the process to um

724
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,679
you know improve but then don't chuckle

725
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,000
but

726
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,279
stocks not change the world

727
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,080
if someone was doing a bingo then they

728
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,520
were like yeah they're waiting for it

729
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,880
but the reality is

730
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,000
uh you know average joe like me you know

731
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
did not think about plc or industrial

732
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,840
security before then

733
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,159
but uh since then the interesting thing

734
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,000
is the apt-like

735
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,880
behavior um so forth from what we know

736
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
has only happened five times

737
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,400
right in the industrial security world

738
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,919
so the past decade

739
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,720
there is a um there is a group of people

740
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,039
uh

741
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,960
significant experience a lot of

742
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,559
knowledge that say

743
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,400
we should not focus on these apts

744
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,679
because so far

745
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,559
they've only been five attacks versus

746
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,640
thousands of attacks off in a ransomware

747
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,520
type or

748
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,919
it like you know that happen every

749
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,840
second right and a colonial pipeline is

750
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,039
a good example

751
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,360
now old smart florida is another example

752
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,159
you see these you know remote um

753
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,480
access credentials being dumped on you

754
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,000
know whatever some kind of watering hole

755
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,159
attack and you know got some information

756
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,960
or you know two fact authentication not

757
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
being used something goofy something

758
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,520
simple that

759
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
an average i.t person would be like why

760
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840
in the world like this is 20 21

761
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,159
like why are we not doing these basic

762
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,679
things is the question right

763
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,799
but those things happen routinely but

764
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,559
you know the apt-like you know

765
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,320
long-range attacks needing

766
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,360
you know access to level one or

767
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
some kind of jumping the air gap

768
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,400
environment and

769
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,679
beyond the dmz those things can happen

770
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,919
but you know for the average company you

771
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,799
know whether it's

772
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,880
i say average even bigger companies like

773
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,840
colonial or jbs or whoever

774
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,080
most of the attack scenarios are not at

775
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,840
level one so they are mostly

776
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,480
coming from the internet facing you know

777
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,960
whether it's

778
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,039
uh you know some kind of cloud bucket

779
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,320
that's misconfigured

780
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,279
or you know some kind of i.t like issue

781
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,080
that you know

782
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,000
like you know it's happening every

783
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,440
second and

784
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,520
that'll continue to happen in that world

785
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,120
so ooty um

786
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,679
you know is is not immune to ot specific

787
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,320
attacks

788
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,400
uh we're not saying that at all but the

789
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,720
the attack surface is much bigger coming

790
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,159
in from the i.t

791
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,000
we're working from a threat intelligence

792
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,520
field i wonder how many attacks have

793
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,200
actually occurred that

794
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,960
no that have just been swept under the

795
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,720
rug too right like i feel five

796
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,200
is so low there has to be a decent

797
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
amount out there that everyone's like

798
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,320
you know what no one talk about this

799
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,840
uh we don't want to start right now

800
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,159
well it's interesting you say that

801
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,399
because uh you know these are all cyber

802
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,480
physical systems right so of these five

803
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,000
you know when you think about crash

804
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,399
override or you know havocs or

805
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,120
even struxnet there is usually a

806
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,080
physical

807
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
device or physical process that got

808
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,200
disrupted at the end

809
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,760
and that's how you tend to know so yes

810
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,880
it's possible that

811
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,320
you know every day industrial plants

812
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,440
go through outages and if it's because

813
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,520
of some kind of liability issue or if

814
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,279
it's because of some instrument failure

815
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,799
or mechanical issue

816
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,039
or in a malicious attack or doing

817
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,559
something on their own we wouldn't know

818
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,919
unless they tell us

819
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,640
but usually there is a cyber physical

820
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,159
element at the very end

821
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,720
that's disrupted so you you think you

822
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,120
would know like it's hard to um

823
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,640
escape from that fact like you would ask

824
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
the question hey there's a flare you

825
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
know i used to work in houston

826
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,600
and there's a flare on the east side of

827
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,120
the ship channel like what happened well

828
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,320
they have to give you the answer

829
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,480
that hey you know we we screwed up you

830
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,919
know somebody did some

831
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,360
uh mistake and and so we had to flare or

832
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,440
you know this device failed and so we

833
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,159
had to flare or whatever right so um

834
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,919
now of course i haven't heard saying oh

835
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,200
we were attacked

836
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,960
and so that's where we're playing but

837
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
that's possible you know that might be

838
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,440
uh

839
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
this decade right so it didn't happen

840
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,480
last week it doesn't mean

841
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,120
the future will follow what we saw in

842
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,399
the last year

843
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,760
i think that as a deterrent just because

844
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,840
it hasn't happened it probably won't

845
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,200
happen it's like just because it hasn't

846
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,880
happened doesn't mean it's not going to

847
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
happen

848
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,399
well no one's come after us yeah but the

849
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,480
day is coming the target pool is

850
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,000
lessening every day oh my goodness

851
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
right but that's the interesting piece

852
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,520
if you look at a lot of vendors selling

853
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,799
security products

854
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,799
it's hard for them right because uh you

855
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,559
know if you walk into a c-suite and say

856
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,080
hey here's my product that'll

857
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,799
that'll save you from x but the x hasn't

858
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,840
happened yet

859
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,600
uh you know how do you get funding for

860
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,960
that x right

861
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,279
so that's why you know i work for a

862
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,480
vendor as well and

863
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,960
what we focus on is uh you know the

864
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,480
current attack surface right and you

865
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,679
mentioned set intel

866
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,679
you know follow the money right so what

867
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,279
is that until telling us

868
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,360
where are the exploits right now but

869
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,559
they happen to come from

870
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,039
um you know remote access or some kind

871
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,559
of vpn or

872
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,080
uh you know some kind of credential

873
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
theft focus on that today

874
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,679
oh by the way while you're at it if

875
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,840
you're improving your security posture

876
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,240
buy a tool or a suite of tools that you

877
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,000
can expand into ot

878
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,159
that can protect you on these other

879
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,679
possible scenarios

880
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,120
that way you know you're not starting

881
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,360
from scratch if you wake up one day and

882
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,159
you notice

883
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,080
maybe in your industry or in a sister

884
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,480
industry that something similar

885
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
because these plcs could be used in so

886
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,679
many industries right

887
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,080
from healthcare to transportation to

888
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
power to oil and gas so

889
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,919
just because something did not happen in

890
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,919
power or oil and gas

891
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,600
doesn't mean we cannot learn from

892
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,720
something that already happened in

893
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,679
healthcare

894
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,399
or in transformation so absolutely

895
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,840
another common thing i see

896
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,600
is that people don't really know their

897
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,159
own mitigation arsenal well enough they

898
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,360
don't know the capabilities of

899
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
everything that they have so like oh we

900
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,159
need a solution for this and it's like

901
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,520
well did you know that

902
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,039
the thing you have literally has that

903
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,480
capability if you would just turn it on

904
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,159
or pay for the extra service or whatever

905
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:34,960
so

906
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
people are out there not even fully

907
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,840
utilizing the benefits of the things

908
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,360
they already have

909
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
and so you might not need to go out and

910
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,159
get something or you might have the

911
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,919
ability to plug a hole where you just

912
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,000
haven't realized it yet or people don't

913
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,279
properly deploy things in the first

914
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,240
place they don't get

915
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,000
those sessions with those like support

916
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,520
engineers they don't um

917
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,640
you know sign up for the proper

918
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
onboarding they just want to take it out

919
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,159
of the box and plug it in and spin it up

920
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,760
and do i see assets in there this is so

921
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,519
fun super cool we'll work on tuning that

922
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,960
later and then they never do

923
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,200
it those manuals are long and boring all

924
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,919
right no one wants to read those like

925
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,480
guess who's reading them me like

926
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,519
we have teamers security manuals that's

927
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,039
what i gotta do before i wade through

928
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
the vlogs

929
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,960
yeah y'all are awesome in that uh you

930
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,080
know what

931
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,000
we kind of helped the blue teamers right

932
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,399
about you know what what the holes are

933
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,720
i think the biggest gap we have is time

934
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,399
and and resources right

935
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,320
there's only so many things like the

936
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,399
average controls engineer in a typical

937
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,799
foundry that i know of is dealing with a

938
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,640
hundred different control systems in a

939
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,440
given day

940
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,039
a hundred i'm not even joking right and

941
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,360
um you know they're they're not looking

942
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,880
to

943
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,640
improve on security they're just trying

944
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,559
to maintain the plant and

945
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,720
have the plan to lively operate so

946
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
they're not thinking about security

947
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,000
every given second so we need to

948
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,200
fundamentally

949
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
improve the security when we offer these

950
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,240
products to them

951
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,559
right it's so hard like any user right

952
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,760
like if you give them

953
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,440
if you give an average user taking an id

954
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,519
example if you give them a windows 10

955
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,360
box and expect them to maintain it

956
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,200
that's one thing but if you give them a

957
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,640
windows xp box

958
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,279
and and expect them to you know keep it

959
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,240
secure

960
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,760
now that's not practical right like

961
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,840
you're not helping them win

962
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,440
so in a lot of these situations

963
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,679
industrial controls have had that uh

964
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,360
legacy where you know you run these

965
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,919
things for 25 30 years and

966
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,000
they were never built with security in

967
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,960
mind so

968
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,640
you know they got they got a piece of

969
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,880
cheese so you're trying to

970
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,559
you know tell them to protect the cheese

971
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,240
like how is it possible

972
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,279
right my my dad is a scada engineer

973
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,799
for a local utility and he was like

974
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,080
i got in there and he just he's put so

975
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,840
much security in because he's actually a

976
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,000
very security centric person

977
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and um he tells me about the things that

978
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,519
he does and i'm just like oh

979
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,919
thank you thank you so much because like

980
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,399
that very few that we have you know yeah

981
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,679
because for you guys it's not a question

982
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
of if it's a question of when you guys

983
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,519
are probably getting a dozen hits a day

984
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,960
from people trying to take you down you

985
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,159
know i'm pinging them a little bit and

986
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,679
see how it's going

987
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,399
so it really is very very crucial for

988
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,320
ics's specifically

989
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,840
the next challenge for him if you ask

990
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,039
him i'll tell you the same thing the

991
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,880
next challenge for him is

992
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,200
where and how can he transition like

993
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,720
let's say he gets a promotion

994
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
and suddenly you know there's no one to

995
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,480
fill his shoes so

996
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,640
that plant needs a backup plan and they

997
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,840
typically don't have it

998
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,760
right so he can't leave the plant in

999
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,440
someone's safe hands because there's no

1000
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,919
one

1001
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,760
to take the mantle over from him that's

1002
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,840
a challenge we have

1003
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,000
that that is the problem is like people

1004
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,159
like him are very hard to find

1005
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,960
um well so he'll probably have to do

1006
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,080
some succession planning

1007
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,519
that's another thing that it

1008
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,720
professionals don't do a ton of

1009
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,679
succession planning

1010
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,399
like um you know when i vacated my last

1011
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,600
pen testing position i was the only

1012
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,200
different person doing all the offensive

1013
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,640
and security testing at all and when i

1014
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,320
left it fell onto the infosec program

1015
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,240
manager who while she had the capability

1016
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,679
didn't have the bandwidth

1017
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,120
and it took them six months to backfill

1018
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
me and now that person is still not up

1019
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,080
to speed and it's like you know the more

1020
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,840
succession planning you do like the more

1021
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,719
planning

1022
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,560
you do period the more prepared you are

1023
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,918
for when changes happen sudden changes

1024
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,000
right when you mention succession

1025
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,440
planning and i'll add

1026
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,320
separation of duties and job rotation

1027
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
none of these exist

1028
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,320
in the ot world especially no this is

1029
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,960
one guy

1030
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
or one gal that knows how this thing

1031
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,159
works and

1032
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,000
as long as they're around you know you

1033
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,359
can keep it you know

1034
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,879
it's not even written down anywhere it's

1035
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,399
just in his head so then when it goes

1036
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,040
down you're gonna call him and be like

1037
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,560
literally someone retired and took the

1038
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,079
whole infosec program

1039
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,800
with them like they didn't write it down

1040
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,679
um

1041
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,399
my tiny unicorn um no one of the biggest

1042
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,000
things that gets me is like in all of

1043
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,800
my security like academic documentation

1044
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,239
that we have like all the teachings that

1045
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,760
i just completed in my master's it's

1046
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,399
like forced vacations job rotation like

1047
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,640
learn a new capability shadow someone

1048
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,480
new force them to take vacations then in

1049
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,440
reality it's like

1050
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,359
don't you dare take a vacation you need

1051
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,440
two hours for surgery you get two hours

1052
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,280
and have your phone on it's like

1053
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,800
we're not enforcing any of that we're

1054
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,359
not doing these secure things

1055
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,880
we're not doing any of these things that

1056
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,720
we at the very basics say everyone

1057
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,079
should be doing because

1058
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,720
we are so short staff we are so hyper

1059
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,960
concerned with like that one person

1060
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,720
not vacating their post at any cost

1061
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,800
yeah big challenge for sure

1062
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,960
all right do you have uh any questions

1063
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,680
from the audience

1064
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,000
i don't know if they see any discords

1065
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
someone said amazing presentation thank

1066
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
you so much we all agree that ics is

1067
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,200
like a unicorn

1068
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,760
yeah well i guess that's in team with uh

1069
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,800
the current grim con for sure

1070
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
i think i should get one of those hats

1071
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,880
uh is it a hat or a tiara or how do you

1072
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,160
get that

1073
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,079
it's like a little oh headband yeah

1074
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,359
there you go you steal it from your

1075
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,560
children

1076
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,119
i stole it yeah i think that's one thing

1077
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:07,680
that you know

1078
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,760
if you ever get to meet bryson in person

1079
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,440
you know giving code with it now

1080
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,599
you know we should ask him to distribute

1081
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,040
more of these

1082
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,839
yeah i think all speakers get a unicorn

1083
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:18,880
headband

1084
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,480
like for uniform

1085
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,560
unicorn headbands instead of a set of uh

1086
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,240
business cards he just hands those out

1087
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,720
with his name and number on the corn

1088
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,400
i'll be great a little qr code on the

1089
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,800
back oh yeah there we go

1090
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,640
there you go now we're cooking with fire

1091
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,160
might as well throw gps tracking in it

1092
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,880
too you know and then just make it

1093
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,240
might as well actually might as well

1094
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,880
make that qr code go to a malicious

1095
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,920
landing page

1096
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,359
listening back children don't do that

1097
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,280
that's very bad and very illegal don't

1098
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,640
do it

1099
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
well you're then forcing people right if

1100
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,480
you get one bad experience you learn

1101
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,040
from it

1102
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,359
you're then forcing people to deploy all

1103
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,320
your links

1104
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,680
on a virtual machine that they can burn

1105
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,520
you're telling them what to do

1106
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,359
so we do have one comment and it's jason

1107
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,119
asking you to stick around for the next

1108
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,400
talk

1109
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,599
uh which i'm guessing jason is the next

1110
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,839
talk

1111
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,079
but i'll be happy to i've been really

1112
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,000
enjoying the conference myself uh

1113
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,160
i i couldn't attend one but because it's

1114
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,599
always a challenge right which track

1115
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,480
you're on

1116
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,079
but uh i've seen like three

1117
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,839

1125
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
that's right i've had my fair share of

1126
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,119
tacos and and really good opinions about

1127
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,079

you guys aren't tacos here not balls

1136
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640

1137
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,599
wonderland bar

1138
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,880
what's up where's that i mean ob it's an

1139
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,760
ob

1140
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,720
ocean beach yeah right there in the

1141
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,079
boulevard where it curves around

1142
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,920
that's what was on twitter this morning

1143
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,760
someone posted and said

1144
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
there should never be an option to have

1145
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,359
two tacos

1146
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,920
the whole bread was about you should get

1147
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,560
a chance to get one taco or three tacos

1148
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,960
but no to taco business

1149
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,800
why are there taco flights too i don't

1150
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,640
want three of one kind of taco

1151
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,119
i want one of like like you have 12

1152
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,000
tacos i want to try multiple tacos

1153
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,920
i want like a tiny sampler of each of

1154
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,079
your 12 tacos

1155
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,400
you go to so so san diego if you go to

1156
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,760
san diego you have to go to tacos

1157
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,000
alberto right so tacos el gordo

1158
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,599
the closest they were going to build one

1159
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,200
in little italy but i think the closest

1160
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,839
one

1161
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,720
is closer to the border off of h street

1162
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,240
in national city

1163
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
and i've never been there you've never

1164
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,040
been there i don't think so

1165
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,200
they have they have one in in east

1166
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,400
county now

1167
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,839
that's like a brother but they have

1168
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,520
adobata tacos

1169
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,490
those are the best those are the best

1170
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,960
[Music]

1171
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,560
you know i don't know which ones you

1172
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,079
like i mean so

1173
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,640
being in in houston right being texas

1174
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,240
that there are two distinct groups so

1175
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,640
one

1176
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,880
