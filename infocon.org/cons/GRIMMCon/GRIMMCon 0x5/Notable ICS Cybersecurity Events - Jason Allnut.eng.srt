1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,240
uh hi everyone

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,839
uh thanks for choosing to spend some

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,600
time with me here today uh my name is

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
jason allnut and this is my presentation

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,680
on industrial control systems related

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,000
cyber security events and malware

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
and specifically the five listed here on

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,760
my my title side

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,720
uh before i begin i i feel necessary to

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,399
say thank you to grim khan for giving me

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,360
this opportunity

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,120
to to speak with you all today this is

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,440
my first chance to uh present at a cyber

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,559
security conference

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,120
uh and i'm just incredibly uh grateful

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,960
and excited to be here so

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,879
with that out of the way let's go ahead

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,480
and get started

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,640
so a little bit about myself i studied

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,760
electrical engineering

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,079
uh in college i did have a a

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,239
concentration or a focus in power

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,199
systems

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,160
so uh ics and infrastructure is kind of

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,600
near and dear to my heart

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
uh while i was in college i got a chance

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,800
to intern

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,438
at a small power plant here in maryland

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,439
uh which was a wonderful experience

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,000
and gave me a lot of hands-on experience

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,119
in the field

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,560
but from there i went on and became an

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,159
rf test engineer with the nationally

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,759
recognized test lab

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,759
and then that led to my current role as

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,240
a program manager with ieee

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,720
and before i go on any further i do need

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,400
to put out the disclaimer that the

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,240
the thoughts and perspective and

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
opinions here

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,840
uh are solely my own and do not reflect

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,119
that of ieee

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,520
or or any of my past affiliations so

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,720
just want to throw that out there i'm

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
sure people are used to hearing it but

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,280
uh

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,360
yeah so a little bit about this

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,600
presentation this is a pet project of

49
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,079
mine

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,920
i'm not a cyber security professional

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
i'm actually an enthusiast and a

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,720
hobbyist

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
uh and ics cyber security is is

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
something that really gets me going

55
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,920
and i think there's a lot more people

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,799
like me so i made this presentation for

57
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,759
electrical engineers uh who you know

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,560
might be

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,840
in in the um industrial sector

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,439
or work on power systems uh and and

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,720
hear about black energy three or triton

62
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,200
or uh stuxnet but maybe you haven't had

63
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
a chance to dive in any further

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
uh so hopefully this can be a little bit

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
of a primer on on those

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
for them uh also uh same goes for cyber

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,000
security professionals who aren't in

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,959
the ics space right there's a lot of

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,720
opportunities now

70
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
a lot of jobs opening up in ics so

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
hopefully this presentation can be a

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,080
tool for them

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
uh as well and then anyone else who will

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
listen like i said i'm a hobbyist i'm an

75
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,959
enthusiast and i suspect there's other

76
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,840
people like me

77
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
um who might really appreciate this

78
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,040
information and and sort of the way i've

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
laid it out here which which you'll see

80
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,840
in a minute

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
uh so what you can expect i've tried to

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,319
summarize these these five malwares and

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:48,959
events

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,519
as best i can so there's a slide with

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,200
some bullet points there's some images

86
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,560
there's some icons

87
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,959
um and and just gonna do like a really

88
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,720
quick summary of each of them

89
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,879
i've also tried to add some additional

90
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,480
tidbits in perspective my own

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,440
perspective

92
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,959
uh with my background in electrical

93
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
engineering and um and power systems so

94
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,319
hopefully people appreciate that and

95
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,840
then just be um

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
you know just helpful tools right so i

97
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,319
really tried to to put things in here

98
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,879
that

99
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,440
people can you know come back to if they

100
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
want to say oh which

101
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,400
which which event was which who was

102
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
involved with what who were the players

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,720
what was

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,680
important about that or this uh so so

105
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
i've tried to put in some helpful tools

106
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,799
in here and like i said you'll see more

107
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,319
of that as we go ahead

108
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,239
through this so the first uh event

109
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,879
or malware here is havocs there's a

110
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,560
reason why i started with havocs it's a

111
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,159
little out of place

112
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
uh chronologically but i thought it was

113
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
a good place to start and and again here

114
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
i've tried to put in some images

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,480
to to jog people's memory and and put

116
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,879
some you know images with uh

117
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,000
wherever they're going to store this in

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
their brain uh

119
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
havocs havox is a malware that included

120
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,000
an ics module

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,439
which is why it's considered one of the

122
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,599
ics uh malwares

123
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,720
it was discovered in 2013 uh it's its

124
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,599
sole intent

125
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,599
its real intent was was espionage

126
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,480
enumeration uh discovery it didn't

127
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,760
really have any

128
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
damaging effects or intent as far as i

129
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,478
know or as far as

130
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,720
my research could tell me uh but yeah it

131
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,080
was solely just to

132
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
to give uh attackers if you will

133
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
insight into ot networks operational

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
technology networks and environments

135
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,320
uh there wasn't really a target event

136
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,639
site country i did see some reports that

137
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,120
say united states and europe where the

138
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,400
with a sole focus

139
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,639
i i don't know if that's how

140
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,160
corroborated that is

141
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,440
uh but the the noteworthy thing

142
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,960
about uh havocs is the opc module the

143
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
open platform communication which is a

144
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
common industrial communication

145
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,880
protocol uh i i'm not very familiar with

146
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,680
it myself

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,919
but if you who participate in any ics

148
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,120
uh capture the flag events or

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,440
you know just even research this stuff

150
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,639
even a little bit you're going to see

151
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,360
opc

152
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,240
quite a bit and havoc's included a

153
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,199
module

154
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,400
that was able to uh do an opc scanner

155
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,960
right and enumerate

156
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
ot ot environments based off of of this

157
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,639
opc

158
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,759
uh protocol some common protocol uh

159
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,880
ports uh that the scanner looked for uh

160
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,560
i've highlighted here in this third to

161
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,600
last bullet

162
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,000
point uh port four four one 105 and 502.

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,240
uh i tried to align those with with

164
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
common protocols that are

165
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,680
you know out there i'm not sure how much

166
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,199
how relevant that is

167
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,840
but these are are common ports that

168
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,240
industrial manufacturers and vendors use

169
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
and so that's what really kind of gives

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
this away as as ics related

171
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,360
the other interesting part uh about

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
havocs that i like to point out

173
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,000
is the uh intrusion or distribution or

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
propagation

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,600
of of the malware and so i put some

176
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
helpful icons here but phishing emails

177
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,720
which i think a lot of people are

178
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,840
familiar with

179
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,039
now uh trojani software uh

180
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,680
software with like you know like it says

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,720
a trojan

182
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
piece to it and then watering hole

183
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,560
attacks and watering hole attacks

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,039
as i was doing this research uh kept

185
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,000
coming up as

186
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
a real interesting part of this so you

187
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
know the idea is that the attackers

188
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,840
monitored websites that uh

189
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,639
industrial engineers or

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,639
not industrial engineers but engineers

191
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,880
in uh you know the power and energy

192
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,160
sector or in

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
industrial environments would frequent

194
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
uh they infected those websites so that

195
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,440
when the engineers went there they were

196
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,039
downloading malware instead of you know

197
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,960
whatever they were expecting to download

198
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
or receive

199
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,080
so uh the last part of of all of these

200
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,960
is i do try to align the attribution

201
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,160
uh i know that's a taboo subject but it

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,720
seemed

203
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
remiss not to include it because it is

204
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,120
well documented in lots of places

205
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,960
so do with that what you want i'm not

206
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,039
going to pay too much mind to it but i

207
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,080
did include it in

208
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,680
my little scorecard here that you can

209
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,840
see on the right

210
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
so with any of these uh events and

211
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,120
malware

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,400
uh it's important to bring up the purdue

213
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,919
uh model this is obviously very well

214
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,960
known among

215
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,120
probably the cybersecurity community

216
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
very well known around the ics

217
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
cybersecurity community but you know

218
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,680
electrical engineers probably don't

219
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,759
really think about this all that much

220
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
and what this is the purdue model is it

221
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,240
breaks down the segmentation between

222
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,960
you know corporate enterprise it

223
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
networks kind of the traditional i.t

224
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,720
networks that we all think about

225
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,919
uh with a organization uh down into

226
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,720
the different layers when the you know

227
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,639
industrial control engineers you know

228
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,240
come into play right your scada

229
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
engineers and

230
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,160
your field techs and just all the way

231
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
down to the devices there and level zero

232
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,919
that actually do the work the actuators

233
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,000
the sensors the conveyor belts that move

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,759
and whatever else have you

235
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,479
uh so i like to i like to show this

236
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,120
because

237
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,520
with all of these events in malware uh

238
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,319
they all

239
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,840
have a part where you know um a pivot

240
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
from the i.t

241
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,599
the traditional enterprise network into

242
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,400
the ot

243
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,639
environment took place at some point

244
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
right and so this kind of helps

245
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,680
illustrate you know

246
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
how that might happen or you know where

247
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,880
that might go

248
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,000
so i hope people appreciate that uh

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,880
also i try to include the miter attack

250
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,679
ics

251
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,399
framework ttps for each one of these in

252
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,839
a longer

253
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,240
uh version of this presentation i would

254
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,839
try to go into

255
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,680
you know some of these different ttb

256
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
some of the more common ones and the

257
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,279
common mitigation or remedies for them

258
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,880
that was some great feedback i got from

259
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,640
another person out in the industry

260
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
to to always talk about mitigations but

261
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
unfortunately i just i don't have enough

262
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
time here today but

263
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,839
i did include this i think it's uh good

264
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,000
visually

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,120
stuxnet uh stuxnet is the most probably

266
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
well-known

267
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,279
uh malware uh talked about whenever you

268
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
talk about ics cybersecurity

269
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
probably don't need to tell anybody here

270
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
that i know a lot of people probably

271
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,680
roll their eyes when they hear it

272
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,160
because

273
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,200
oh here we go again but as i was doing

274
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
this project this was the most exciting

275
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
part for me because it's just such a

276
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,600
dense topic

277
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,279
and it it has no end it feels like

278
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,120
whether you're talking technically

279
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,480
or geopolitically or you know just

280
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,720
down to the the individual people and

281
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
their narratives it's it's it's just

282
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
extremely fascinating

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,600
and it really kind of reminded me of

284
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
another event um

285
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
that if you ever go to a power and

286
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,480
energy conference you're absolutely

287
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,040
going to hear

288
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,600
almost to the same cadence that stuxnet

289
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,519
is and that's the 2003 northeastern

290
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,720
blackout

291
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
this satellite picture here shows it you

292
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,160
know there's a blackout

293
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
happened in 2003 spanned all the way

294
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,040
from ohio to new york down to maryland

295
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,240
up through canada

296
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,040
um and it's it's it's widely widely

297
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,800
known widely talked about it's a great

298
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,160
use case and

299
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,079
i think you know i wanted to put the

300
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,399
2003 northeastern blackout and stuxnet

301
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,640
sort of on a similar plateau

302
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
if you will as just wonderful use case

303
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,800
examples that

304
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,480
there's just endless amount of things to

305
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,839
learn from

306
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,800
but what was stuxnet it was a incredibly

307
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
complicated malware

308
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,000
its target was the siemens plc's that

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
eventually controlled the centrifuges uh

310
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,800
for a uranium enrichment process

311
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,480
uh in natanz iran uh

312
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
what usually gets talked about with

313
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
stuxnet is the the four

314
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
zero days uh and when i was putting this

315
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,839
project together i thought it would be

316
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,800
really fun to go

317
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,040
and find uh the actual you know

318
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,079
write-ups uh

319
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,040
of those cves on on nist's website and

320
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
i've included those links here if anyone

321
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,399
else is interested

322
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,519
um one one interesting piece that i just

323
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,320
can't get over

324
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
and i always talk about now is that uh

325
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,440
actually a fifth

326
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,000
zero day was sort of included in the in

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,839
the stuxnet development

328
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,480
uh in an earlier version and i found

329
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,399
that to be incredibly fascinating

330
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,920
uh oh and i should also talk through the

331
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,079
scorecard here so uh it was discovered

332
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,800
in 2010

333
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
its likely intent was to actually break

334
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,600
the uranium enrichment process

335
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
uh the the target country obviously iran

336
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,360
the target site

337
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
although not a nuclear power plant my

338
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,959
icon's a little deceiving there it was

339
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,480
the uranium enrichment

340
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,200
uh plant uh noteworthy tech windows and

341
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,279
siemens and the initial intrusion

342
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,720
uh was usb sticks right so usb sticks

343
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,959
that were infected with the malware left

344
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,160
around the site

345
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
eventually those usb sticks got plugged

346
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
into engineering workstations

347
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,560
the malware then uh pivoted onto the

348
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
engineering workstations

349
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
uh and then eventually uh because the

350
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,519
plcs the siemens plc's that were the

351
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,079
intended target were actually air gapped

352
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,680
uh from you know the common network uh

353
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,160
the the intent and the hope by the

354
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,240
attackers was that the engineers would

355
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,279
carry

356
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,120
the malware on their engineering

357
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
workstations over the air gap to the

358
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,240
plc's

359
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,720
um and eventually um you know the the

360
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,639
end place where the malware was intended

361
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,760
to end up

362
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,959
uh the malware would then um uh

363
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,720
plant itself on a plc um and then start

364
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,880
to control the converters

365
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,560
that controlled the speed of the

366
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,639
centrifuges and centrifuges are

367
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,240
incredibly delicate

368
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,399
fragile machines i mean they're big

369
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,279
spinning

370
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,360
uh machines but they're they're kind of

371
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
fragile in nature

372
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,639
uh and so any kind of manipulation of

373
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,320
them can can eventually end up

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
tearing them apart uh attribution is the

375
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,079
united states and israel

376
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,760
that's well documented and talked about

377
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
although never confirmed

378
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
um again you know do with that

379
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,720
information uh what you want

380
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,240
so what i think is lost

381
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,079
maybe not lost but you know we're in the

382
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,079
day and age of ransomware right

383
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,600
uh it ransomware everywhere and

384
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,360
ransomware when it shows up it's loud

385
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,519
and it's noisy and it makes itself known

386
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,360
hey i've come and i've encrypted your

387
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,240
files

388
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,200
pay me money uh but stuxnet and and some

389
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,000
of these other

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,240
uh uh malwares uh you know their

391
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
real crux was their their subtlety right

392
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,639
and their patience and their ability to

393
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,800
sit dormant and wait because you know

394
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,000
their their intent is

395
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,240
to create this destruction but kind of

396
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,760
go unnoticed and that's exactly what

397
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
stuxnet was trying to do and so

398
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,279
i tried to put together this is one of

399
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,199
my big brain visual ideas

400
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,240
uh this this sort of visual just how

401
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,680
long and over what period the stuxnet

402
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,320
worm

403
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,199
operated uh versus like you know sitting

404
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,240
dormant right so

405
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,880
once stuxnet made its way onto one of

406
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
the plc's the siemens plc's it actually

407
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:55,519
sat

408
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,120
dormant for 12 or 13 days did nothing

409
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,920
well technically it recorded and logged

410
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,240
what was going on but on that 14th day

411
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,399
uh it would then increase the speed of

412
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,760
the centrifuge

413
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,360
uh from you know 1064 hertz to 1400

414
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,920
hertz

415
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,800
uh for 15 minutes that's it for 15

416
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
minutes and for that 15 minutes

417
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
um the malware was also able to replay

418
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,440
what it had recorded from the previous

419
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,560
13 days

420
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
and give back to the control center you

421
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,720
know what was a normal reading

422
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
uh but then after that 15 minutes it

423
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,440
would go back to normal and then it

424
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
would sit dormant again for 26 days

425
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,880
uh and then on the the 41st day there uh

426
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,720
for 51 minutes it would decrease the

427
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,519
speed

428
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,720
uh from 1064 hertz down to two hertz

429
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
uh from what i understand the

430
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,320
centrifuges never actually made it to

431
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,440
two hertz that would be pretty

432
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,320
noticeable

433
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
if you know something spinning at 1 000

434
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,760
hertz all of a sudden

435
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
just started spinning the two hertz uh

436
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,440
but but the idea was that it would it

437
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,800
would slow down enough

438
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,560
uh during that 50 minutes that it would

439
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
create damage um

440
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,040
and then and then after that 50 minutes

441
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,880
go back into a dormant state

442
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,360
wait 26 days and then repeat the process

443
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,720
and if it hadn't already created the

444
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
damage in the centrifuge uh it

445
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,800
you know probably would you know on its

446
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,000
next iteration

447
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
so you're looking at 65 minutes of

448
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000
manipulation

449
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
over 67 days and i i just think that's

450
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
just the most fascinating part of

451
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,720
stuxnet

452
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,560
uh that i like to to tell people is you

453
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,000
know when these things are in

454
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,199
your system they can play the long game

455
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
you know they can play the long con and

456
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,360
and stuxnet sure is a great example of

457
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
that

458
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
again ttp is much more complicated than

459
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,120
havocs a lot more highlighted here

460
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,600
i greatly encourage everybody to look

461
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,759
these up if you have time

462
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,920
uh black energy three black energy three

463
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,680
and crash override are always

464
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
spoken about in tandem you'll see why

465
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
here in a minute

466
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
um but we'll just go right into it black

467
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,360
energy three is a malware that led to

468
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,320
the interruption

469
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,199
of um the electrical power in ukraine

470
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,199
for about a quarter of a million people

471
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,000
uh in december of 2015. its intent was

472
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,279
to turn out the lights

473
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
uh that's an oversimplification

474
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
obviously but i think it uh

475
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,279
kind of describes it pretty well the

476
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,279
target was ukraine

477
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,759
the target site was three electric

478
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,720
distribution

479
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,120
utilities uh distribution being the key

480
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,000
word there

481
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,040
uh and the best word that i learned

482
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,320
during this whole project

483
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,199
uh obernergos which is the name for

484
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,360
utilities in ukraine so that's

485
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,320
a fun one to say uh the noteworthy tech

486
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,639
is

487
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,279
kind of hard to describe because black

488
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,839
energy

489
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,920
iii although it's considered an ics

490
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,759
malware

491
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,519
the the ics part of it

492
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,639
really came down to the target

493
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,199
which were these utilities uh which were

494
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,639
targeted through spear phishing

495
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,480
campaigns so you know

496
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,639
campaigns that were targeting these

497
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,000
these it personnel

498
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
at these utilities slightly different

499
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,120
than just a general fishing campaign

500
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,079
and uh and then the manipulation by the

501
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,759
attackers once they got a foothold

502
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,799
in the system so uh the the malware the

503
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,599
black energy

504
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,400
iii uh created a foothold in the

505
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,679
obernergos

506
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,319
uh the attackers were then able to

507
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,199
enumerate

508
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,160
and investigate do espionage um create

509
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,760
some some changes while they were in

510
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,400
there

511
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,640
um a couple of things that they did was

512
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,439
they uh

513
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,439
reconfigured the uninterrupted power

514
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,880
supply

515
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
uninterruptable power supplies uh for

516
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,880
the control rooms

517
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,000
installed kildisc also corrupted some of

518
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
the firmware for some of the serial to

519
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,120
ethernet converters that

520
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,480
that talked from the substation out into

521
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
the field or excuse me the control room

522
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,760
to the substations

523
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,080
uh and then you know on the day of their

524
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,799
attack

525
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,080
um they were able to basically log in

526
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,799
uh take control uh turn some breakers

527
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,440
off

528
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,640
uh create a bunch of havoc uh when when

529
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,480
you know uh the unreal power

530
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,160
sources were supposed to turn on they

531
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,840
weren't because they were misconfigured

532
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,440
uh when power was restored to the

533
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,600
control room the kill disc uh made the

534
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
engineering workstations

535
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
inoperable or at least some of them um

536
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,640
and then even further more

537
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,080
uh the control room wasn't able to

538
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,679
communicate out into the field because

539
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,160
of the

540
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,080
uh misconfiguration of the firmware of

541
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,240
the serial to ethernet converters so

542
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,480
uh a lot going on there but again what i

543
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
want to emphasize is that black energy 3

544
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,559
didn't actually have those pieces

545
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,520
in it you know coded into it uh black

546
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
energy 3 created the foothold

547
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,799
and then it was actual manipulation by

548
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,559
the attackers to

549
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,960
to execute the the the attack

550
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,760
again it was attributed to uh russia and

551
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,919
the the apt group sand worm

552
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,120
uh we'll talk a little bit more about

553
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,840
this in the next one uh the ttps here

554
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,000
uh much more scarce i'm not really sure

555
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,919
why i just collected this information

556
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:54,559
from minor

557
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,679
attack frameworks uh site so um you know

558
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,520
do what that what you wish

559
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,440
uh but then crash override so crash

560
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
override uh

561
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,960
again in tandem with black energy three

562
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,559
because again it was russia attacking

563
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,600
ukraine

564
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,080
crash override almost one year to the

565
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,880
date

566
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,240
uh which has got to make for a

567
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
frustrating year oh yes

568
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,720
this uh i always appreciate when people

569
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,480
point out the obvious to me because you

570
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,000
know what's obvious to one person isn't

571
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,520
always obvious to another person and

572
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,720
i've actually been asked this question

573
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,919
what is the difference between crash

574
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,440
override and in destroyer

575
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,760
they mean the same thing uh they're just

576
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,679
the the same event with two different

577
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,600
names by two different organizations

578
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,919
dragos uh coined this crash override

579
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,880
eset

580
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
um out of slovakia coin this in

581
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,480
destroyer but

582
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,799
for the most part they're the same thing

583
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,480
so so please don't let someone trip you

584
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,679
up with that

585
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,880
but yes uh crash override took place in

586
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,440
28

587
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,240
2016. again the likely intent was to

588
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,520
turn out the lights

589
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
target country ukraine the difference uh

590
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,360
with crash override

591
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,440
than black energy is the target here was

592
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
actually transmission

593
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,440
um transmission utilities which i'll

594
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
talk about in a little bit but that's

595
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,320
that's a big difference that i like to

596
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,280
harp on

597
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,520
uh and another big difference is crash

598
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,760
override actually included

599
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,919
the ics modules uh to enumerate

600
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,360
and infiltrate and make manipulations to

601
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
the system

602
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,200
on its own so it didn't necessarily need

603
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
that attacker

604
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,360
remote access to come in uh and make

605
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,080
changes

606
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,440
and execute the attack

607
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,520
it's it's a considered a malware

608
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
framework

609
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,039
uh and i've highlighted some of the uh

610
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,919
um

611
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,440
communication protocols that were

612
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
included with with the malware

613
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,240
but something that is really great

614
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
that's highlighted well in industry in a

615
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,919
lot of these papers and talks is that it

616
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,679
would be very easy to include

617
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,960
other protocols into the malware

618
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,559
framework and one such protocol that

619
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:54,960
gets

620
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
referenced a lot is dnp3 uh which which

621
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
would make

622
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,159
uh crash override a little bit more uh

623
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,440
applicable to

624
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,080
north america's grid and i don't think

625
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,320
it should stop there either right dmp3

626
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,720
modbus 2030.5 i'm listing some ieee

627
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,320
standards

628
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,520
but yeah so just something uh relevant

629
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,720
you know if somebody says oh crash

630
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
override that was only in europe uh it

631
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,159
could be applicable here in north

632
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:22,720
america

633
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,159
if somebody i guess took the time uh

634
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,440
there was a vulnerability found uh

635
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,240
with with the malware that i i want to

636
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
point out here that didn't actually

637
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,559
uh take effect per se from what i

638
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,600
understand

639
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,760
but what they found was that uh black

640
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,159
enter excuse me crash override was able

641
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:42,880
to

642
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,039
put some of the siemens zipper tech

643
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,720
relays into a firmware update state

644
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,240
that made the relays look like they were

645
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,679
operational

646
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,520
but in fact were not operational they

647
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,880
were actually waiting for a firmware

648
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,600
update

649
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,240
uh and if you er well i guess i didn't

650
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
mention this but

651
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,840
what with black energy 3 and crash

652
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,120
override one of the things that was

653
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,960
discovered was that ukraine's

654
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,320
electrical grid is has a lot of legacy

655
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,919
equipment and a lot of engineers who

656
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,000
know how to do manual overrides

657
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,039
and that really um

658
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,960
helped in its ability to come back

659
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,640
online so quickly

660
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,520
um versus you know a more digital or

661
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,559
automated

662
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,159
grid maybe like we have here in north

663
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,320
america and so if you think about it

664
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,080
with these relays looking like they're

665
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,200
functioning

666
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,120
and a bunch of engineers manually

667
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,240
putting the system back

668
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,039
online thinking oh i've got protection

669
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,640
down the line because that plc is

670
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,360
working

671
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
that could create a lot of damage um if

672
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,000
if if it really had worked the way that

673
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,360
it was intended

674
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
thankfully it didn't work that way uh

675
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,280
but i i want to bring this up because

676
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,400
these are the types of things that

677
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,159
engineers need to be watching out for

678
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,559
right this this in-between firmware

679
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,480
update state that people

680
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,559
probably see every day with like oh

681
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,919
that's just the way it works don't worry

682
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,480
about it

683
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,600
you know these are the things that

684
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,280
attackers are really going to harp on

685
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,320
and pounce on as an opportunity so

686
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
just wanted to bring that up uh again

687
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,679
russia sand worm

688
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,600
uh there's a book by andy green

689
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,440
greenberg called sand worm that's just

690
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,200
an incredible read and so i got a lot of

691
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
information from that and i just wanted

692
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,120
to give kudos so

693
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,320
again ttps um oh

694
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,240
as i mentioned before uh black energy

695
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,320
three looked at the distribution

696
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,120
system and crash override was focused on

697
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,320
the transmission

698
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,080
system and that's a big distinction here

699
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,440
i really really

700
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000
the intent of this slide deck in this

701
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,520
presentation is to really line

702
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,360
these events up next to one another and

703
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,720
be able to tell

704
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,080
you know what what one uh

705
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,679
event targeted and what the other one

706
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,440
targeted and you know kind of pick and

707
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,279
choose you know what applies to you so

708
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,640
hopefully this helps

709
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,960
um i'd love to talk more about this uh

710
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,679
but

711
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,000
um yeah if you have any questions please

712
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
hit me up

713
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,279
also i think it's good to put into

714
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,799
perspective you know these events

715
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,559
compared to some other ones so

716
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,400
i spoke a little bit about the 2003

717
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,919
north american power outage

718
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,760
affected about 55 million people 23 000

719
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,159
megawatts lost lasted four days if you

720
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,440
think about this year

721
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,240
uh with the 2021 texas energy crisis

722
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,159
affected about 5 million people lasted

723
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,120
three days

724
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,840
uh black energy three and crash override

725
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,919
lasted six hours and one hour

726
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,039
respectively uh i'm not trying to

727
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,960
downplay these events i just want to put

728
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,440
in

729
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,360
uh perspective you know the doom and

730
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,039
gloom uh

731
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,120
uh perspective that a lot of people can

732
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,559
have when it comes to these sorts of

733
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,279
things so

734
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,720
you know we're still battling mother

735
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,640
nature in physics and time and all those

736
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,520
things and

737
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,200
uh these events you know don't

738
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,799
necessarily compare but i think the

739
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,799
potential is there and people can see

740
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,919
you know the the capabilities and this

741
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,840
brings me to triton triton is really

742
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,039
well talked about

743
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,240
uh because it it it

744
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,279
focused on the safety uh system

745
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,240
of a site and that's important because

746
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,960
when you

747
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,880
when you talk about these other events

748
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,039
you know uh breaking a process turning

749
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,000
out the lights

750
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,559
espionage you know the the damage is

751
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,679
pretty menial i

752
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,679
i would assume the people in ukraine

753
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,039
might feel differently

754
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,360
but with triton here the intent of the

755
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,600
malware was actually focused on the

756
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,200
safety instrument systems that

757
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,000
controlled

758
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,679
the hydrogen sulfide levels at a

759
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,039
petrochemical cla

760
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,440
plant in saudi arabia and that's a big

761
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,960
deal because

762
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
you know that hydrogen sulfide is is

763
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,880
nasty hazardous stuff

764
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,200
toxic flammable uh you don't want it

765
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,039
getting released out into the air

766
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
and so the fact that this malware was

767
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,240
trying to actually you know

768
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,919
possibly create an environment like that

769
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,080
where this gas is leaking

770
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,480
is really scary and upsetting to think

771
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
that somebody would focus on that so

772
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,360
that's why triton gets a lot of

773
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,159
attention

774
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,000
it was a malware that was focused on a

775
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
petrochemical plant in saudi arabia in

776
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,080
2017

777
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,520
it gets its name from the schneider

778
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
electric triconics controllers

779
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,440
uh that were used um at that site

780
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,120
that that controlled the hydrogen

781
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
sulfide levels uh

782
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,559
one one really interesting note and i

783
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,320
know i'm speeding through here is that

784
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
uh the malware was actually written with

785
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,799
python

786
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,159
and i thought that was really

787
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,200
interesting because you don't

788
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,400
necessarily hear

789
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,760
python mentioned all that often um

790
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,240
and i it just really stood out to me it

791
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
was it was python compiled for windows

792
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,080
machines so clearly these people

793
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,000
kind of knew what they were working with

794
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,120
um and

795
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,840
uh and and were able to get these this

796
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,400
malware from engineering workstations

797
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,360
uh to the triconics controllers and then

798
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:39,760
what i

799
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,120
actually ended up giving them away is

800
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
the trichonix controllers managed to

801
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,000
malfunction

802
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,880
and shut down the plant uh and so no

803
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,559
damage was actually done

804
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,960
um however the potential is certainly

805
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,159
there

806
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,640
again attributed to russia and this

807
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,320
research institute

808
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,559
um and that's pretty much all i'll say

809
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,960
about that

810
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,720
uh ttps much more elaborate um

811
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,960
i just i can't i can't recommend enough

812
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,760
going to

813
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,559
miter attacks uh uh website and looking

814
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,840
these up and looking up the

815
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,880
the mitigations uh it's it's just a

816
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,400
wonderful resource for learning

817
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,080
uh and something i'm you know trying to

818
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,720
learn myself

819
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,679
so here's the scorecard laid out uh i

820
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,880
said it this at the beginning of the

821
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,039
presentation i really wanted to put

822
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,760
these events together side by side so

823
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,520
you could look and say oh who were the

824
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,399
players

825
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,399
what were the technologies you know this

826
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,000
that and the other uh what were the

827
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,640
years

828
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,559
so i i hope this is a tool that you can

829
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,120
use uh at least be a quick reference

830
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,159
um i would love to know additions

831
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,440
if if somebody's got some good

832
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,399
suggestions so please again hit me up um

833
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,039
and let me know what you think of this

834
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,320
and then my takeaways

835
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,559
so i only have three real takeaways i

836
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,159
tried to highlight some pieces

837
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:56,960
throughout

838
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,880
that i would love for engineers to to

839
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,720
take away from this presentation and be

840
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,000
cognizant of

841
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,320
uh but these three takeaways are the

842
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,760
ones i wanted to leave you with uh the

843
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,320
first one

844
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,600
is um ics cyber security is extremely

845
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
fascinating i'm a hobbyist i'm

846
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,880
enthusiast i think there's a lot of

847
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,919
people like me

848
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,919
there's multiple different avenues for

849
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,520
entry you know whether you're a

850
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,039
programmer or a cyber security or

851
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,480
electrical engineer or whatever

852
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,000
so i think there's a lot to be learned

853
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,440
here and a lot of places where you could

854
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,039
say oh i think that's interesting i'd

855
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,159
like to learn a little bit more about

856
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,240
that or that relates to me so

857
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,279
uh second um is that

858
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,480
these events together create just

859
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,919
an incredible list laundry list of use

860
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,600
cases and examples

861
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,399
um and things to be learned and applied

862
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,000
to your industry or

863
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,760
you know somebody else you know industry

864
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,360
so um you know

865
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,840
these events are not all the same um

866
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,720
they are not

867
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,520
all just ics events right they are all

868
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,840
unique and there's a lot to be learned

869
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,000
and i think stacked up together uh they

870
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,960
make for a

871
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,320
interesting uh learn and then lastly

872
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,640
uh our infrastructure is incredibly

873
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
fragile we're battling physics

874
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,520
environment time and cyber threats is a

875
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,440
is a new threat vector that we have to

876
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,559
take into account

877
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,279
uh and so um i just wanted to kind of

878
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,159
leave people with

879
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,600
you know it needs to be taken seriously

880
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,440
and it needs to be expected

881
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,840
and with that i just want to thank uh

882
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,120
grim khan again

883
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,799

yeah thanks so much have a go to the

893
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,840
conference

894
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,720
all right

895
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,799
i'm gonna leave uh i'm gonna leave this

896
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,480
slide up just for a little bit

897
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,559
so anybody can uh hit him up

898
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,840
maybe possibly uh actually scan that qr

899
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,240
code i know i'm not going to but uh

900
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
who's feeling ballsy someone do us do it

901
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,360
and let us know what happens

902
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,279
because i'm too paranoid to do that

903
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,039
i'm sure he's totally trustworthy i'm

904
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,200
sure is there 30 more no no there's one

905
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
second

906
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,039
did it stop 30 seconds late

907
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:37,840
let's see

908
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,720
all right awesome

909
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
what's interesting oh you're muted again

910
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,679
so when i press play on this at mewtwo

911
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,159
it doesn't allow me to skip through the

912
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,600
actual video

913
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,639
quit doing that

914
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,240
silence woman this is my show now

915
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,399
it ended at 29.36

916
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,039
oh the qr code is his google slides do

917
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,240
you trust him

918
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,840
he's he's technically not in cyber

919
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,360
security so it's probably more

920
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,240
trustworthy

921
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,279
but i i don't trust qr code

922
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,440
go this just brings me to covid and

923
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,279
trusting qr codes everywhere it was

924
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,440
scary it's a scary time

925
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,120
before i scale if you are going to see

926
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,200
our menu you have no idea how much i

927
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,279
cloned with that and i was just like

928
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,880
i had to start looking at menus ahead of

929
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,320
time because i was just like

930
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,240
please give me a paper one like i'm not

931
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,760
scanning your random qr code

932
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,640
no all right who's got some questions

933
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,480
for jason uh honestly that was an

934
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,080
awesome talk jason i wish you were in

935
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,880

937
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,120
a very you know

938
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,919
either well i meant the video chat not

939
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:58,399
just

940
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,840

quickly like me he's like oh god i can

945
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,960
see that i'm getting low on time but i

946
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,080
have a lot of information i want to

947
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,880
impart on to you

948
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,240
so let's go go go go go

949
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,480
there you go i entered you into

950
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,080
panelists so if you have a mic and a

951
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
camera

952
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,640
you could you can talk

953
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,279
wait is all about that outsourcing life

954
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,200
ah there you go okay i'm gonna close the

955
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,159
video

956
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,760
can you hear me yeah yes

957
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,200
uh can you see me yeah okay

958
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,159
i can't see you guys i wasn't expecting

959
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:48,880
to do this

960
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,159
so i'm not properly dressed or placed

961
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,360
uh yeah thanks i gotta figure out how to

962
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,559
get rid of

963
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,480
the actual video when i try to quit it

964
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,200
doesn't go yeah

965
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,440
um yeah the last the last 30 seconds

966
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,360
uh was more or less just me thinking

967
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
grim khan

968
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,640
everybody who listened to me babble

969
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,080
and um and then also ron brash who

970
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,679
mentored me he had a lot of good

971
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,840
feedback he's a great resource he like

972
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,320
studied

973
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,720
a lot of these things so it was really

974
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,039
great to get his perspective

975
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,000
um i'm actually really curious what

976
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,960
thought

977
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,360
um kind of wish my presentation was

978
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,220
before his

979
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,399
[Laughter]

980
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,919
but uh yeah i don't know if anybody has

981
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,840
any questions i will say that uh

982
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,559
i recorded this thing like four times

983
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,279
and

984
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,679
like the first two times it came in at

985
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,519
like 50 minutes

986
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,600
47 minutes so yeah there's a lot of

987
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,200
extra information in here

988
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,840
that i was trying to cram in but no that

989
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,559
was perfect

990
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,320
for your first talk that was really good

991
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,480
i i saw the time and you're like

992
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,559
30 seconds under i'm like oh he's got it

993
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,600
he's got it good but

994
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,240
for someone who isn't even in the field

995
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,880
that was

996
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,440
excellent like just to say it again that

997
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,199
almost reminded me like the dark knight

998
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,119
diaries readings right it was

999
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,040
enough to where anyone who's cyber

1000
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,320
security is really going to appreciate

1001
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,239
it and enough for anybody to be able to

1002
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,280
understand it

1003
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,639
and go further uh but yeah yeah

1004
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,918
i really appreciate you saying that

1005
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,159
because that's kind of the the middle

1006
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,079
ground i was targeting

1007
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,399
um i'd love to do a more technical deep

1008
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,399
dive obviously that would require a lot

1009
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,719
more of myself and i still

1010
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,159
wanted it to be like entry level enough

1011
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,760
where like like i say you could share

1012
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,599
this to like your electrical engineering

1013
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,480
friend

1014
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,000

share all my resources all my citations

1030
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,200
and even some like

1031
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,400
longer write-ups um

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,599
uh so um you know if if you do

1033
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,960
if you're looking for a place to like

1034
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,119
dive more in it's it's all there

1035
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,920
and uh yeah it's it's fun stuff

1036
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,400
it looks fun i've never really had had

1037
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,160
everything broken apart like that like i

1038
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,880
always like

1039
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,320
oh i just said that it went after this

1040
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,599
and it made this do that and if it's

1041
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,079
like

1042
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,480
you never know why or how and i would

1043
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,320
love personally to know a lot more about

1044
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,839
that side of things

1045
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,520
yeah yeah for sure for sure um

1046
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,280
ics i think is really different than

1047
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,760
a lot of the other cyber security uh

1048
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,640
facets

1049
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,200
um you know one of the main things and

1050
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,880
i'd love to hear about vex take on this

1051
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,839
but you know when

1052
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,599
when you get down to the plc's and the

1053
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,960
rtus

1054
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,720
uh you're talking about like a lot of

1055
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
proprietary systems

1056
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,760
a lot of um rudimentary

1057
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,480
uh systems you know one of the big

1058
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,760
things they talk about

1059
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,160
with ics pen testing and stuff is like

1060
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
you can't just do a normal scan because

1061
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,440
you'll take everything offline

1062
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,119
and then you'll shut down a plan and

1063
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,200
then ruin everyone's day

1064
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,480
and stories about that yeah yeah yeah

1065
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,200
yeah

1066
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,040
and so like i really appreciate those

1067
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
things that that sensitivity and that

1068
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,320
challenge

1069
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,359
um and just all those uh you know like i

1070
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,480
say proprietary technologies and stuff

1071
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,359
it's what i studied in college so um i

1072
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,560
don't know i hope other people get

1073
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,079
excited about it i hope it doesn't scare

1074
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,119
other people i hope

1075
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,200
other people look for ics opportunities

1076
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,640
because i think there's a lot out there

1077
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,800
professionals yeah there's definitely so

1078
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
much in ics and ics is one of those

1079
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,320
things that it's so hard to do

1080
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,000
because everyone's doing it different

1081
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,320
there is no standardization there is no

1082
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,839
uniform standard there is no gold

1083
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,040
standard like it's

1084
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,839
it's so hard yeah what are some of the

1085
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,440
training resources really for

1086
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,040
ica like i don't even know yeah so cesa

1087
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,960
has some free training the cyber

1088
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,640
security and infrastructure security

1089
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,680
agency

1090
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,040
um that i know of uh obviously sans

1091
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,800
has a ics uh of course um

1092
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,240
i've heard of some other things i think

1093
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,560
uh some of the national labs like idaho

1094
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,079
national labs but i'm not i'm not sure

1095
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,599
if those are

1096
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,520
public or not um

1097
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,359
i've heard of idaho labs and what

1098
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,119
they've did there but i've uh to

1099
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,800
all like give me a little background

1100
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,560
i've also worked in the power industry

1101
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
for a little bit

1102
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,680
so i they flirted with sending me to the

1103
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,079
idaho

1104
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,920
labs testing thing but i heard all about

1105
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
you and it sounded super cool but i

1106
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,280
never got to go

1107
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
ah yeah yeah i i mean i'm not in this

1108
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,760
space like i

1109
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,119
don't really have the capacity to

1110
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,040
justify going uh with my current

1111
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,079
employer but

1112
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,000
um i have heard people mention it and it

1113
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,280
sounds like it's really good

1114
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,800
and um but there is a lot of

1115
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,359
freely available stuff too which is

1116
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,880
where i got all my information

1117
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,320
so yeah awesome

1118
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:33,839
it's out there if you want to find it

1119
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,920
you
