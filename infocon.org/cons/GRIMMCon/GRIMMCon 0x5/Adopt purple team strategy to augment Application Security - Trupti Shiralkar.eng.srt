1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
story of how you got here

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,640
uh yeah that was part of my planning

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,200
uh my intro yeah i have already planned

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,480
that but it's like

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
really brief uh story

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,520
do you guys see my screen we do your

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,240
share is up

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,320
we've got um we've got four minutes

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,480
until we we get into the presentation so

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,000
we're just gonna chat with you for a

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,760
little bit so we get started

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,240
um awesome so shall i unshare my screen

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,000
uh you're welcome to keep it up while

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,600
we're talking

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,920
okay

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,879
i'm i'm really excited about this

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,600
because purple teaming of course

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,079
is i don't think it's a new concept

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,360
really i think it's something

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
that it's not and but it's it's new to

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
i think that it's really the way it's

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,879
been formalized as

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,600
a as a process um we've published a

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
purple team exercise framework and

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,039
that's looking more at the

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,280
traditional red and blue together and

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,480
what i thought was really cool about

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,080
when i when i reached out to tripty

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,280
again she's going to talk about how she

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,320
showed up here

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
but i'd seen that she'd given this talk

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
before and i'd never seen

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
anybody put purple teaming in

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,920
application security

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
yep 2016 last con that's where i first

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
gave the talk

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,280
because i was tired of being one person

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,400
absec

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
show and just red teaming or just blue

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,520
teaming was not working out

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
i had to combine both and create a

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,680
feedback loop

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
between blue teaming and red teaming

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
so yeah today you will get to hear the

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,600
story of how this all started

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,240
so are we live right now brazen we are

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,360
live yeah no we are

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
we're just here chatting every uh we're

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,799
keeping the audience entertained until

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,960
we start the formal presentation

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
okay so brazen

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
how did you got into purple teaming

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,920
how did i get into purple teaming uh

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,399
okay

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
so um i used to do really

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,520
uh spooky things a long time ago and

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,720
i um started

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,680
grim uh by myself as a consultancy back

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
in 2013.

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
and nice at the time i had this idea

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,200
for um a more integrated operations loop

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
for being able to

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,840
um uh you know essentially conduct

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,760
offensive operations and then a feedback

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,120
loop for understanding that because

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,840
that's

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
even today that's still relatively

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
simplistic

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,239
and um

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
as as the years went on we started

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
getting into commercial penetration

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
testing and commercial red teaming

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
and it was really interesting for me

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
coming from you know

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,599
where i mean again red teaming is meant

76
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,120
to be the emulation

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,599
of an adversary's tactics and there's a

78
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,760
number of compromises that are inherent

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
in that approach because

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,920
uh you can't spend the same amount of

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,800
money as

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,319
uh you know a client's not gonna spend

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,280
that amount of money in that amount of

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
time and red teams generally can't spend

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
that amount of money or time

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,879
to to do something that is like you know

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,319
the equivalent of like we're actually

88
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,920
like the chinese apt

89
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
um and so i knew those compromises but i

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,519
didn't realize how

91
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
far down those compromises went and so

92
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
it was several years of learning that

93
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
and one of the things i quickly picked

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:21,920
up

95
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,480
was um and i think anybody who's done

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
offensive security whether that's

97
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,319
penetration testing or red teaming

98
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,239
where you do the test for the client you

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,080
come back a year later and it's the same

100
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,040
thing yeah it's the same vulnerabilities

101
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,440
and

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
you think about it and it's like well i

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,879
mean i gave you this 50 page detailed

104
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,519
report

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,319
why didn't you fix these things and the

106
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,920
reality of course is well you know

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
they've got their normal lives of doing

108
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,319
these things

109
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,799
and that's not always a priority and so

110
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,080
i just kept thinking there had to be a

111
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,879
better way

112
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,680
um and one i felt like the process could

113
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
be improved

114
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,840
why can't we help them fix this as we go

115
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,239
um

116
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,120
two i didn't like what i saw the ego

117
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
driven mindset of

118
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,239
penetration testing and red teaming and

119
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,840
that's a talk i've given

120
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,280
um i don't know i think i first gave

121
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
that talk in 17 or 18.

122
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,080
um because i got the impression that the

123
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
teams were just trying to win

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,519
they weren't trying to help the client

125
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
it was how can i how can i win

126
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,519
how do i get to ad how do i drop mike

127
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
and boom i want it you know like

128
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,199
and it's not business oriented and it's

129
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,320
not beneficial

130
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
um and it's it's adversarial so that's

131
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,680
where i

132
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
naturally found myself into the concept

133
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,880
of purple teaming before i

134
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,960
even knew what purple teaming was i'd

135
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,320
never heard the phrase

136
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
i just had arrived at it intuitively

137
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
from my experiences

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,479
okay you know what i thought that's

139
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,000
super simple i knew you have

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,720
some sort of military army or navy

141
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
background

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
i thought you were actually a navy seal

143
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
in your past life

144
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
and that's where you learn not only

145
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
defense but

146
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
bunch of attack techniques and you

147
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
brought those to cyber security

148
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
so where you were navy see you i was uh

149
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,759
an army officer

150
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
okay i'll i'll try not to take that as

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
an insult that you thought i was in the

152
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,199
navy

153
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,479
no everything

154
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,520
is very uh respectful to me

155
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
thank you for your service yeah no i'm

156
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,360
just teasing uh yes i was

157
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
i was an army officer i worked in the

158
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,199
intelligence community and national

159
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,320
security for

160
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,520
a long time um and then uh

161
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
for those who aren't aware of my current

162
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
biography i still um participate in

163
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
government i was a strategic advisor

164
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,280
to the director of cisa last year that's

165
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,320
kris krebs

166
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,080
um i left in november and i'm also um

167
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
an advisor to the board of the army

168
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,440
cyber institute

169
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,520
okay cool but this isn't about me

170
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,120

mode

187
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,479
yes that's good yep awesome

188
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,759
so a grim khan thank you so much for

189
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,080
inviting me here what a pleasure to be

190
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,880
here

191
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,639
and the short story is how i found out

192
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,680
about grim corn

193
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,039
is i happen to meet the founder of grim

194
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,319
brazen board in a panel talk

195
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
for security innovation and

196
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,080
the topic of the panel talk was purple

197
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
teaming and i'm like

198
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,919
wow i don't even know there is the whole

199
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,160
company out there that exists that

200
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,560
believes in purple teaming and helps

201
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
their customer

202
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,120
with purple tv approaches so i was very

203
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,840
impressed

204
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,880
and brazen actually asked me hey

205
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,360
do you want to talk at grim con i'm like

206
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,400
why not

207
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,919
i will be more than happy to share uh

208
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,560
15 years of my product security learning

209
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
and how i adopted purple teaming here

210
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,560
with that let's begin

211
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,360
so uh before we get into purple teaming

212
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,319
a little bit about me

213
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,560
it's been 15 years i'm doing product

214
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,440
security

215
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
and i was a mobile game developer

216
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
who did not know the difference between

217
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
a random number

218
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,199
secure random number and a

219
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,680
cryptographically secure random number

220
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
so as a naive developer i have done

221
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
a lot of mistakes that i would not do

222
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
now and this really helped me to

223
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,039
understand the pain points of

224
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,319
development

225
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,680
teams engineering teams in general and

226
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,479
i realized uh how fascinating product

227
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,360
security is and i decided to

228
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
switch my career from mobile development

229
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,000
into product security

230
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
after 15 years of product security

231
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,319
journey i have recently started my

232
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,840
entrepreneurship journey

233
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,199
i will be working on building a genomic

234
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,000
privacy

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
startup pretty soon uh but before that

236
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
uh i have led application security

237
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
programs at amazon

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,360
q2a banking elimio who is a

239
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
leader in micro segmentation and hp

240
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,199
and when i'm not doing security i like

241
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,560
to travel

242
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
paint and meditate if you have any

243
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,719
questions

244
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,440
about purple teaming or content that i

245
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,039
will be presenting here or if you want

246
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,479
to have just uh

247
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,719
you know informational chat with me feel

248
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,240
free to reach out

249
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,440
at the social media handles

250
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,920
so today i will be obviously talking

251
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,959
about

252
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,680
my experience as part of blue teams my

253
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,839
experience as part of red team

254
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,240
why these two teams are not sufficient

255
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,880
then what

256
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,160
a purple teaming philosophy is and then

257
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,040
i will talk

258
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,560
uh how we can implement purple teaming

259
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
as part of the software

260
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,080
development life cycle to scale and make

261
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
it more impactful

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,040
i have couple of examples and then

263
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
i will be providing a reference to a

264
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
case study done by security innovation

265
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,720
and illinois together

266
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
with that uh let's begin

267
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,839
um as you all know purple sorry blue

268
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,480
team

269
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,959
members are those security engineers

270
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:37,680
they work

271
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,440
with the engineering team development

272
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,120
teams qa engineer and they basically

273
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,720
educate software developers

274
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
about security controls defense

275
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,160
way early in software development life

276
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,000
cycles

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,200
whereas red team members can be an

278
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
independent

279
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,959
internal security team which focuses on

280
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:03,680
hacking

281
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,240
 out of a product or it can be an

282
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,839
external penetration

283
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,360
or testing team that

284
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
security teams usually engage right

285
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,680
before the product moves

286
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,760
to production or right after uh

287
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
basically when the development is

288
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,279
complete

289
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,720
the motto of security team uh blue

290
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,760
blue team is basically they are optimist

291
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,079
they believe in the power of security

292
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,200
controls

293
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
they believe in empowering developers

294
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,399
about

295
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,880
the knowledge about security controls

296
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,399
and they try to work with these

297
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,240
engineering team to make sure the

298
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,920
product that they are building

299
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,360
all the security controls are considered

300
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,240
and i uh look at blue team members as

301
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,800
bunch of

302
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,240
optimists whereas secure red teaming

303
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,959
members

304
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,480
these are more paranoid people

305
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,880
they never think that security controls

306
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,760
are enough

307
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,800
and these people are so creative no

308
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
matter how much effort

309
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,040
blue team folks have put into securing

310
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,000
the product

311
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,399
the red team members always end up

312
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,640
finding vulnerabilities

313
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
and that's because they focus more on

314
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
exploitation technique and

315
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
creative ways of exploiting the product

316
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,360
do you all agree with me

317
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
now with that what's purple teaming

318
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
right uh as you know

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,120
i love painting one day

320
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,440
while walking in an electronic store

321
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,839
fries i was thinking

322
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,959
why is it no matter how much effort i

323
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:41,519
put

324
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,519
helping my developers about security

325
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,120
controls defense

326
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,839
the red team members in my case mostly

327
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,160
external penetration testing teams

328
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,839
they always find some new attacks

329
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,560
every time there is a new tech stack or

330
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,000
a new framework

331
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,040
used by engineering then the red teaming

332
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,959
findings are even more

333
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,959
and while walking in the shop i was

334
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,320
thinking why is it

335
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,440
why can't i help my development teams so

336
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,279
that the findings

337
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,920
in a penetration test report literally

338
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,040
becomes zero

339
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,000
what is it that missing and then it

340
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,279
struck me

341
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,320
you know what as a blue team member

342
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,680
i'm teaching my developers

343
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,920
everything the security controls the

344
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,800
requirement

345
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,040
techniques i'm doing threat modeling but

346
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,560
i never discuss

347
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,800
exploitation techniques with them the

348
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
exact exploitation techniques

349
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,839
used by red team members

350
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,920
and that's when i thought i need to

351
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,200
create a feedback

352
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,320
loop between between blue team

353
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,880
and red team and when we mix blue and

354
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,079
red together

355
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,959
it becomes purple teaming and purple

356
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,320
teaming folks are realist

357
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
let me give you guys another analogy

358
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,959
so blue team folks when they help uh

359
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,880
their engineers with throughout the

360
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
product development

361
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
with bunch of security controls and

362
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
whatnot they roll out the most

363
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,800
appropriate security tools to help them

364
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
speed up the secure

365
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
deployment and delivery of the product

366
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,839
these are optimus

367
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,480
let's say they are stuck in a storm

368
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,760
while sailing in ocean the blue team

369
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,399
guys

370
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,600
believe that you know

371
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
all the controls defenses their product

372
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:32,720
has

373
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,639
they are going to easily survive and

374
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,800
pass through the storm

375
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,199
whereas my red teaming member the

376
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,800
paranoids one

377
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,360
they are like you know what this ocean

378
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,600
in that scary storm is so

379
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,000
bad we are not going to survive

380
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,360
whereas what purple teaming members

381
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,480
do is they do not get scared

382
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,399
they are not super optimistic they are

383
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,000
the realest one

384
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,279
what they do is they prepare for the

385
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,560
worst

386
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
they hope the storm will pass soon

387
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,639
and in order to survive in that storm

388
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,199
they make

389
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,040
necessary adjustment by adjusting the

390
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,800
direction of the sail

391
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,160
that's how they survive

392
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,959
now let's talk how this purple teaming

393
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:23,920
philosophy

394
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
can be implemented in the form of

395
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
process

396
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,800
i'm sure you all have seen security

397
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,360
within

398
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,399
software development lifestyle the top

399
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,320
half of this diagram

400
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
shows waterfall sdlc usually

401
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,800
nowadays uh 10 15 years back waterfall

402
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
sdlc was very common

403
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,279
but now the industry has moved into more

404
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,920
agile software development life cycle

405
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,480
as we are going more and more into a

406
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:54,959
more

407
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,000
micro service-oriented architecture but

408
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,240
in some of the legacy applications and

409
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,920
system we still see

410
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,120
waterfall as clc exist so if you look at

411
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,560
uh how securities weaved in in today's

412
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,320
software development life cycle we will

413
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,760
see that

414
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,519
at requirement phase we security members

415
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,639
do threat modeling

416
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,959
then in design phase we do something

417
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,360
called design architecture review from

418
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,839
security perspective in

419
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,680
coding uh deployment phase uh

420
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,600
security engineer roll out those

421
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
fabulous static code analysis tool

422
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
that help developers find code related

423
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,279
issue

424
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,480
then in testing we basically

425
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,040
implement and roll out bunch of security

426
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,959
testings tool it could be a dynamic

427
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,959
application security scanner

428
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,920
or open source security scanner or it

429
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,680
could be interactive application

430
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
security scanner there are like bunch of

431
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,399
tools

432
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,959
out there today's talk is really not

433
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,600
about

434
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,560
uh tooling so i i don't want to shift my

435
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,920
focus

436
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
and then when the product the

437
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,120
application is

438
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,759
ready to move into production or has

439
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,440
just moved into production

440
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,079
basically the code base is mature we

441
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
hire penetration testers

442
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,279
to come hack our application and find as

443
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
many security issues as possible

444
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,360
now as you all know penetration testing

445
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,639
is expensive plus

446
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,600
it happens way late in software

447
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,920
development life cycle

448
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,720
when we do threat modeling we basically

449
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
use checklist approach or

450
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,199
same for design architecture review so

451
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,959
the result of penetration

452
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,920
test we cannot replicate way early in

453
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,560
software

454
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,040
uh life cycle development if you look at

455
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,839
the second

456
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,720
uh the bottom half of the image which

457
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,639
shows agile sdlc

458
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,199
more or less we do the same techniques

459
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,800
but the frequency

460
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,120
of these security assessment methods are

461
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
actually different

462
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,519
uh the speed of delivery and deployment

463
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:01,839
is

464
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,039
so high in agile sdlc that

465
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,240
we put more emphasis on

466
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,079
basically tools and again the story is

467
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,640
same

468
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,760
when the product is mature and

469
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,160
it is available in production that's

470
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,039
when uh

471
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,400
we conduct external penetration tests

472
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,039
uh let's take another look at the same

473
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,760
software

474
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,799
lifecycle development but through ci cd

475
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,160
so with the rise in micro services uh

476
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,799
the industry has adapted more continuous

477
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,559
integration and continuous delivery

478
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,200
model

479
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,240
and here we give paramount emphasis on

480
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,200
rolling out the right tools and for some

481
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
reason

482
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
the industry thinks that if you have the

483
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
tools that means you have the security

484
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,120
you have done

485
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,880
all the necessary due diligence but

486
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,360
in spite of all these tools penetration

487
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
testers still

488
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
find really good security issues right

489
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,880
yes

490
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,000
so why is that and i believe that

491
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,160
most of these security tools are still

492
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,840
in their first generation

493
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,880
they don't necessarily have the context

494
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
of the business logic of the application

495
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,559
or they are not

496
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,440
exclusively made based on the technical

497
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,559
stack

498
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,360
uh the particular application uses

499
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,440
that's why there is like a lot of false

500
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,160
positive

501
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,520
and it's a nightmare to deal with

502
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,000
not nicely tuned security tools so i'm

503
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,720
not gonna

504
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,200
get there but basically in spite of

505
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,480
having army of

506
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
security tooling still there is

507
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,200
something big is missing

508
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,360
now when i talk about purple teaming

509
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,760
which is basically

510
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,799
mixing the knowledge of exploitation

511
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,760
techniques

512
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,559
and security controls and making your

513
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,360
developers

514
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,600
educated about it this is how it looks

515
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,880
like to me

516
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
so in requirement phase uh the way

517
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,039
or even before requirement phase uh

518
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,960
imagine

519
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,080
when you approach uh developers or qa

520
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
engineers or you know any engineering

521
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,080
team with bunch of security findings

522
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
from penetration press report they don't

523
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
like it

524
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,760
it's their baby you're calling their

525
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,880
baby ugly

526
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,520
with all these security findings

527
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
generally speaking they do not like it

528
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,200
but when we approach development

529
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,720
teams with security trainings

530
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,000
then they feel empowered

531
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
i have worked with so many smart

532
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,200
developers and

533
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,000
nobody has ever not like security

534
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,320
training they really appreciate

535
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
when security teams approach them with

536
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
very comprehensive

537
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,640
security trainings exclusively designed

538
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,400
for their stack

539
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,919
their style of architecture pattern

540
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,880
used by the engineering team so when i

541
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,520
try to do purple teaming i always always

542
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,000
start

543
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,039
with developer security training if they

544
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,760
are using

545
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,240
ruby react javascript i don't try to

546
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,320
teach them vulnerabilities in cc

547
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,919
plus i focus on their tech stack

548
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,080
so purple teaming always starts with

549
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,000
developer security

550
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,159
in requirement phase irrespective of

551
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,360
what sdlc you are using

552
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,679
i try to teach them security

553
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,520
requirements and i have a detailed

554
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,559
um example just

555
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,760
after a couple of slides in design phase

556
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,080
i

557
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,039
not only tell them security controls but

558
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,080
i also explain

559
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,799
them exploitation techniques and what i

560
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,760
request them is

561
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,799
now you fine tune your design

562
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,360
based on the exploitation technique and

563
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,840
then

564
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,039
rest of the sdlc goes uh in the similar

565
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,000
fashion

566
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,919
so let's take a quick example

567
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,280
this is an unrestricted a file upload

568
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,720
feature uh this type of feature

569
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,960
is very common in a lot of applications

570
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,360
uh it could be you know uploading image

571
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,159
or simple

572
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,000
text file so let's see how i apply

573
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
purple teaming

574
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,000
uh to this particular feature before i

575
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,679
apply a purple teaming

576
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,400
let me explain you as a blue team member

577
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,679
what would i do

578
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,320
as a red team member what would i do so

579
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
as a blue team member

580
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,880
whenever i see my developers are

581
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,640
building this type of feature or they

582
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,120
have recently built this type of feature

583
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,400
i make sure uh to educate them about

584
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,360
hey you know bad guys can access this

585
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,760
feature and they can upload nasty stuff

586
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,080
like

587
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,200
virus so make sure you only allow

588
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,720
authorized user then i also try to tell

589
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,919
them about

590
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,919
file size make sure you put a

591
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,799
restriction on file size

592
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,919
otherwise somebody can upload a zip bomb

593
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,960
right then i talked to them about

594
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,520
hey make sure you do all sort of input

595
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,559
validation

596
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,600
by checking the right file extension

597
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
and please do not use a blacklist

598
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,919
approach or sorry deny list approach

599
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,039
always list allow list approach the

600
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,240
extensions that you are expecting

601
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,799
please ensure that those are in the

602
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,600
allow list

603
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
instead of blocking all the bad

604
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,440
extension and once the file gets

605
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,039
uploaded to the server

606
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,720
don't forget to run antivirus now this

607
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,679
list looks pretty comprehensive right

608
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,320
yes

609
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,880
it is pretty comprehensive and it can

610
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,480
probably take care of

611
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,280
90 percent of the attacks now as a red

612
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,760
team member

613
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,799
i think like an attacker because

614
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,880
at any cost i want to take down this

615
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,720
application i want to upload

616
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
shell script to take over not just the

617
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,039
application but eventually

618
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,360
the system and network that's my

619
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,480
intention right

620
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,799
so i try to think about all sort of

621
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,480
creative ways

622
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,120
first thing i try to look hey can i

623
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,159
bypass

624
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,799
any function level access controller

625
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,159
then every file

626
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,440
has a magic number associated uh with it

627
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
the magic number is actually the

628
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,039
signature

629
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,320
of the file so by manipulating the

630
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,960
signature of the file you can basically

631
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,400
upload uh

632
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,360
bad malicious files into the application

633
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,240
then

634
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,280
not only this i try to see that can i

635
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,480
change the content of the file

636
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,120
by adding injections i actually tried

637
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,000
this uh

638
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,960
in a banking application which accepts

639
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,520
uh

640
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
excel spreadsheet i tried to add

641
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
cross-site scripting and sql injection

642
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,919
as a content in that file

643
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,320
the application was doing a decent job

644
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,760
at uh

645
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,799
verifying the extension size

646
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,480
uh authorization of the user

647
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,400
but it was not doing a good job

648
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,159
verifying the content

649
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,320
and i was successful uh creating a

650
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,679
cross-site scripting

651
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,520
injection there now

652
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,679
let me wear the hat of a purple team

653
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,200
member

654
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
i have the knowledge of red teaming

655
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,520
techniques i have the knowledge of

656
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,440
security control specified by blue

657
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,799
teaming i'm going to mix

658
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,840
these two together so

659
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,720
i'm going to turn my exploitation

660
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,760
techniques

661
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,960
into security requirements so let's go

662
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,159
back here

663
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,559
i have already let's say hypothetically

664
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,320
i have already trained my developers

665
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,720
about

666
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,520
what could go wrong with file upload now

667
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,080
i am

668
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,039
explicitly mentioning the exploitation

669
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,480
techniques

670
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,320
and turning them into security

671
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,880
requirement even before they write a

672
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,520
single line of code

673
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,799
and in this way i am shifting

674
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,159
that security towards left

675
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,240
i am making my developers

676
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,960
purple team members because they are no

677
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,600
longer

678
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
just developers they are no longer just

679
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,919
security focused people but they

680
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,559
actually have knowledge of exploitation

681
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,520
techniques

682
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,080
that's what purple teaming is and when

683
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,320
when we have those type of discussion at

684
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,039
requirement

685
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,720
phase the uh probability

686
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
and the probability of avoiding these

687
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,120
type of security findings

688
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,960
is so um high

689
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,320
also by preventing these issues

690
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,360
from occurring we are eventually

691
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,919
reducing the cost associated with fixing

692
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,360
these issues as well there was a

693
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,559
beautiful study done by nist in 2002

694
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,640
and it talks about cost of fixing

695
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,679
quality bugs

696
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,600
in each phase and compared to production

697
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,240
uh issues identified in production if

698
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,440
somebody fixes

699
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,679
these issues in requirement design phase

700
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,200
it is 10 000 times

701
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,919
lesser same thing applies for security

702
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:02,720
defects

703
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,000
because security defects are nothing but

704
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,080
quality defects security is actually

705
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,520
part of quality

706
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,640
so why deprive our developers from this

707
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,520
knowledge

708
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,600
as a security team member why should i

709
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,679
keep all this knowledge of exploitation

710
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,360
technique just to myself

711
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,679
when i share it with developer it

712
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,640
becomes easy

713
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,840
for them to implement and it becomes

714
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,880
easy for me

715
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,400
to scale it at higher level

716
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,640
so let's take a look at another

717
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,279
example now uh the first column here

718
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,240
indicates security principles these are

719
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,200
the

720
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,840
11 security principles and if you if you

721
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,880
can think about

722
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,840
any 12th please get in touch with me

723
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
i'll be more than happy to do another

724
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,279
talk

725
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,640
with you the next column uh

726
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,039
shows security requirements the third

727
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,760
column

728
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,039
shows security control and fourth column

729
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,159
shows exploitation technique now imagine

730
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,919
a developer has not written

731
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,559
a single line of code they have come to

732
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,360
you

733
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,799
to uh give to get security requirements

734
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,120
on

735
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,360
session ids basically they are building

736
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,200
authentication module

737
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,159
now uh one of the simplest security

738
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:22,960
requirement

739
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,679
when somebody deals with authentication

740
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,240
is

741
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,039
the session id should be sufficiently

742
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,520
long

743
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,039
they should be random and unique across

744
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,559
all correct active session base right

745
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,440
so this is the requirement uh we have

746
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,000
given

747
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,039
to the development team and then

748
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,919
uh in order to further secure the

749
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,880
session ids

750
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,799
we also tell them a security control

751
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,159
that hey

752
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,520
you can even do a digest

753
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,720
of that uh session id and

754
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,039
make sure you use a cryptographically

755
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,520
secure random number and you use a

756
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,159
fibs approved crypto library to compute

757
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,919
the digest

758
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,880
now as part of purple teaming do not

759
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,399
stop here

760
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,240
you have done a good job as a blue team

761
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
member but as part of purple teaming

762
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,880
remember we are supposed to teach them

763
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
about attacks

764
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
that could happen now as a red teaming

765
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,440
member

766
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
when i see bunch of session ids or

767
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,360
random numbers what do i do

768
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,720
i do entropy analysis and i try to

769
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,480
find out if the entropy is less i try to

770
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,039
do

771
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,919
a brute force attack right so let's

772
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,559
educate

773
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,799
our developers about these exploitation

774
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,880
techniques in requirement phase

775
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,720
itself and help them partner with them

776
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,159
to find the right

777
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,279
library that can defeat entropy analysis

778
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,159
as well as brute force attack so that's

779
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:52,799
really

780
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,760
purple teaming is

781
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,720
now um let me cover some other

782
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,120
aspects of purple teaming as i explained

783
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,159
before

784
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,279
uh it is extremely important to

785
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,440
approach engineering team through

786
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,320
training

787
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,039
and you can create purple teaming

788
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:13,760
through

789
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,600
your uh security trainings second

790
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,559
not do not just focus on developers qa

791
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,480
engineers the people who actually write

792
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
code test code

793
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,880
but also focus on architects focus uh

794
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,399
on your product managers focus on

795
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,320
your program management office who are

796
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
responsible for all the releases and

797
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,200
schedule

798
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,640
and also exec also on the executive team

799
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,720
because it's the top-down approach that

800
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,200
always works bottom-up approach doesn't

801
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,320
work so in purple teaming focus on

802
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,039
all sort of roles and responsibilities

803
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:49,360
that

804
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,720
are important to ship a product and then

805
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,159
weave security accordingly as i explain

806
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,360
in those two uh examples always

807
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
map your business requirement to

808
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,039
security requirements

809
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,760
and then eventually explain the security

810
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,240
requirements in the form of controls

811
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,440
and exploitation techniques you will be

812
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
most successful

813
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
implementing purple teaming approach

814
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,480
when you speak the same

815
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,880
language of your software development

816
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,320
life cycle

817
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,200
do not keep the security knowledge to

818
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,240
yourself

819
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,960
go attend their scrum meetings go

820
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,480
participate in their

821
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,279
book triage meetings go participate in

822
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,440
each and every story time

823
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,520
and explain the controls and

824
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
exploitation techniques so when

825
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,399
we completely immerse ourselves into

826
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,919
engineering processes

827
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,640
and life cycle that's when uh they

828
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,320
understand us and that's the real

829
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,799
success of purple teaming

830
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,360
and eventually uh create a win-win

831
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,240
situation for

832
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,000
all sort of parties you can do this

833
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,640
by acknowledging their efforts you can

834
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,279
do this

835
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,480
by calculating metrics that hey once we

836
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,039
applied

837
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,760
a purple teaming approach see how many

838
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,159
less

839
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,440
bugs have been found by

840
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,480
red teaming members or ever since

841
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,120
we implement purple teaming approach cqa

842
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,000
engineers are

843
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,679
fully capable of finding security

844
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,399
defects or you know the over how the

845
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:20,960
overall

846
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
posture of security posture of the

847
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,559
product has improved so call

848
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,600
out those wins uh reward uh

849
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,640
their efforts and what i like to do is

850
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,919
every six months i like to

851
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,559
host a hacking event where i invite all

852
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,440
my developers q engineer vp's director

853
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,039
and come participate hack with us

854
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,120
all right uh so that was about purple

855
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,760
teaming

856
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,960
uh let me conclude here my time is

857
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,519
almost

858
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,039
up so we just now saw

859
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,399
having red teams uh doesn't help

860
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,720
red teams and blue teams they both are

861
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,240
extremely important

862
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,480
for security of the product as well as

863
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,679
organization

864
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,240
but they working in silos doesn't help

865
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399
when there is a feedback loop

866
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,799
uh between red teams and blue teams and

867
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,080
when we share that

868
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,480
knowledge with engineering teams that's

869
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,840
what purple teaming is

870
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
and purple teaming kind of approach a

871
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,960
mov offers a more holistic approach

872
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,760
purple teaming can be easily weaved into

873
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,440
uh

874
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,039
organizations software life cycle

875
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,320
development

876
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,840
process and as i explained when we

877
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,760
educate our developers about

878
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,440
exploitation techniques

879
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,200
the number of issues that get produced

880
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,159
are less the number of uh defects

881
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,799
security defects that get identified

882
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,080
the remediation rate uh is very high

883
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,919
because developers already know how to

884
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,840
fix it find it and fix it

885
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,440
the overall roi becomes super high and

886
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,840
i genuinely believe in my 15 years of

887
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,919
experience it's the purple teaming that

888
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,279
truly fascinates

889
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,159
uh shift left and it also helps to scale

890
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,279
application security uh recently

891
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,559
i had done a case study on purple

892
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,480
teaming with security innovation

893
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,120
and if you guys are curious or keen

894
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,480
about

895
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,200
how i had implemented uh purple teaming

896
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
in the past i would highly encourage to

897
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,440
check out this case study

898
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:38,240
with that are there any question answers

899
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
so yeah we already have a question uh

900
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,399
will the slides be available to download

901
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,840
is there some place that folks can get

902
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,960
these

903
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,200
uh yes the slides are already available

904
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,559
in my linkedin profile

905
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,279
i have shared them on uh site share also

906
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,080
i'll be sharing

907
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,919
the slide deck with a grim corn

908
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,399
committee

909
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,880
um the case study that you mentioned

910
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,640
there is it possible that we could paste

911
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,600
that link

912
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,840
somewhere uh sure

913
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,760
do you guys still see my screen no

914
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,399
oh uh do you want me to share the link

915
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:14,800
uh

916
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,239
right now yeah if we could just

917
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,599
paste it in chat just send that link for

918
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,119
the case study and then we'll also throw

919
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,239
it on discord

920
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,239
absolutely

921
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,399
so when did you first come up with this

922
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,159
idea

923
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,879
uh twenty uh when i was one person

924
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:37,520
application

925
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,719
security team at q2a banking in austin

926
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,199
texas

927
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,280
nice so similar right there's got to be

928
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,520
a better way

929
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,960
yeah all right um

930
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:03,839
let me share this in chat

931
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,760
uh grace and i think you guys still see

932
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,400
my screen right

933
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,760
yes so this is the case study and i'm

934
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,839
kind of struggling to open the chat

935
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,400
um okay uh

936
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,200
i think i'm not allowed okay if you if

937
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,640
you email it to me i'll

938
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,040
i'll it i can do

939
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,800
you that want to stop sharing your

940
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,000
screen so we don't see your email there

941
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,640
you go

942
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,320
fine i just i i'm always so sensitive

943
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,240
about that offset fail whenever i share

944
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,200
myself oh my gosh

945
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,640
oh no people are going to see something

946
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,680
sensitive i know i know

947
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,599
and here is a link to um the case study

948
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,000
unfortunately this talk is an hour long

949
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,920
and because i had only 30 minutes i had

950
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,520
compressed it

951
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,839
so there are many more aspects of purple

952
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,880
teaming that i

953
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,520
i would love to explain if anybody is

954
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,560
interested like

955
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,880
how to implement purple teaming in a

956
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,680
typical

957
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,040
software life cycle development

958
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,880
what are some common mistakes you've

959
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,839
seen in that implementation

960
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,000
some of the common mistakes i'll start

961
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,599
with people um

962
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,000
you know just because security engineers

963
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
are excited about security and they're

964
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,440
passionate about security

965
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,119
they assume everybody's interested in

966
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,960
security and unfortunately that's not

967
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,200
the case so what you will see

968
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,800
is out of 100 uh 100

969
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,640
engineering team members maybe 50 60 are

970
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,480
interested and not everybody so we have

971
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,760
to keep that in mind

972
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,920
that besides security people have other

973
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,480
things uh online such as

974
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,960
you know uh releasing the product on

975
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,839
time

976
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,599
uh making sure um the shiny new features

977
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,119
that generate revenue

978
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,560
gets preference over security bugs um

979
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
so that's one thing i have seen not

980
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
everybody is excited about security but

981
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,720
those

982
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,800
who are excited about security giving

983
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,839
their medic and

984
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,720
get knowledge and training and making

985
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,880
them your ally kind of creating security

986
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,520
champions

987
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,480
that really helps the second mistake i

988
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,119
have seen

989
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,920
is not getting executive buying

990
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,359
from the top tier management upfront

991
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,560
it's extremely hard to weave security

992
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,200
in the software life cycle development

993
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,680
and

994
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,200
you need right budget right resources so

995
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,359
when you don't talk about these things

996
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,480
upfront

997
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,560
it becomes difficult and security

998
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,079
becomes after thought

999
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,040
the third mistake i've seen is rolling

1000
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,880
out

1001
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,359
incompatible security tools as i said

1002
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,520
security tools are still in their first

1003
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,760
generation

1004
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,240
they still produce a lot of false

1005
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,200
positives

1006
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,320
there are still uh true negative true

1007
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,599
true negatives so these tools

1008
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,839
when when you are doing proof of concept

1009
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,680
uh to select right tool for your

1010
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,280
organization

1011
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,680
always make sure you include your

1012
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,560
developers

1013
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,119
qa engineers get their perspective as

1014
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:23,839
well

1015
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,440
how they are going to feel about

1016
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,359
operating on these tools

1017
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,800
it's extremely important so

1018
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,359
and another thing i want to call out is

1019
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,400
there is just

1020
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,760
way too much emphasis

1021
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,640
on buying commercial tools sometimes it

1022
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,040
is

1023
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,079
uh super easy and cost effective to

1024
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,680
build your homegrown security tools

1025
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,599
uh would you like to hear an example

1026
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,040
brayson

1027
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,759
absolutely

1028
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,520
i have seen um a lot and this is a

1029
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,599
beautiful example of purple teaming

1030
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,119
approach as well in one of the

1031
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,599
organization i had work i had seen a lot

1032
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,359
of sensitive information

1033
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,200
was getting leaked into logs

1034
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,920
now application security folks do not

1035
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,720
take a look at

1036
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,920
blocks logs are something analyzed

1037
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,560
by uh the infrastructure security team

1038
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,119
members

1039
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,400
in production right they have access to

1040
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:24,880
sim

1041
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,960
and they sometimes may catch it or may

1042
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,040
not catch it but getting sensitive

1043
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,760
information

1044
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,920
leaked into logs is such a crucial

1045
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,320
problem because these locks

1046
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
let's say in case of a sas application

1047
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,400
these locks get shipped to customers and

1048
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,160
from customers environment

1049
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,960
god knows which business analytics uh

1050
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,359
will

1051
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,079
uh capture and you know may encounter

1052
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,440
sensitive information so this is a

1053
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,359
really big problem

1054
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,040
and in spite of teaching my developer i

1055
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,960
you know do not um do not lock sensitive

1056
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,920
information

1057
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,640
i was not having great success because

1058
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,160
to be very honest

1059
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,599
development teams they do generate

1060
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,319
uh logs for debugging purpose that's how

1061
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,599
they debug

1062
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,000
and when they are testing security

1063
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,040
features

1064
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,839
it is quite possible that they may log

1065
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,040
session ids or credentials or whatnot

1066
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,839
so just having a proactive approach of

1067
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,800
telling them

1068
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,280
hey do not capture log was not

1069
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
sufficient

1070
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,760
so what i did using my purple teaming

1071
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,720
hat

1072
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,119
i requested i participated in their

1073
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,400
story time and i exclusively called out

1074
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,680
a security requirement once this feature

1075
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,800
is complete

1076
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,960
qa engineers will write automation

1077
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,040
to look for session ids credentials

1078
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,520
uh tokens and all sort of sensitive

1079
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,240
information

1080
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
that this feature is using and they will

1081
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,280
make sure

1082
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,000
that it is not getting locked i did not

1083
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,119
stop there

1084
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,079
i requested a development team to

1085
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,200
actually write a homegrown scanner

1086
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,720
so they wrote a simple grab base filter

1087
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,760
that can scrub logs and it it basically

1088
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,000
checks for these files so in this way

1089
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,760
throughout the software lifecycle

1090
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,040
development not only the

1091
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,960
requirements story time but also in

1092
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,079
design qa

1093
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,920
and post production base we solve this

1094
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,000
problem and

1095
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,560
having our very own homegrown security

1096
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,359
scanner to

1097
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,599
identify sensitive information inside

1098
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,720
logs was

1099
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,319
so much more effective

1100
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,440
than learning sims sim tool and trying

1101
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,160
to

1102
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,200
uh find the this type of information

1103
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,920
uh it probably took a half a day for

1104
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,440
development team to write such

1105
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,119
tool and because this tool was written

1106
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,720
as a collaborative effort between

1107
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,119
security development and qa guys

1108
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,440
qa guys immediately plugged that tool

1109
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,640
into automation

1110
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,440
qa automation framework now that tool

1111
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,880
runs on

1112
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,920
all the releases all the test bits and

1113
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,480
we get

1114
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,680
to uh we basically identify sensitive

1115
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,839
information asap

1116
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,000
so that was my purple teaming approach

1117
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,960
to solve this

1118
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,640
issue so um follow-up question on that

1119
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,079
since you you started talking about

1120
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,599
something that came out in our panel

1121
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,560
which is

1122
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,200
um like in the security community we

1123
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,640
take for granted that people even know

1124
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,000
what red and blue is

1125
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,040
right and in the building community

1126
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,680
right it's

1127
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,440
like that's not that's just like we

1128
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,640
throw it over the fence right it's the

1129
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,920
classic like development

1130
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,800
operations challenge um but then there's

1131
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,680
all of these

1132
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,079
security components to that which are

1133
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,960
essentially a part of

1134
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,200
quality and features right we're turning

1135
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,960
them into features and stories and agile

1136
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,240
developments so that they're

1137
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,480
they're incorporated in that way um but

1138
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,839
something i still have

1139
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,079
i i think it would be interesting to as

1140
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,400
like a further step in that maturity

1141
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,440
would be building um system of systems

1142
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,560
security testing into the the pipeline

1143
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,200
so

1144
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,400
not just you know particular features to

1145
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,480
application but recognizing that

1146
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
an application runs on a system and

1147
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,319
there are other systems around that

1148
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,560
and the security is not just directly

1149
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,400
the potential vulnerabilities on the

1150
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,000
application on that system

1151
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,240
but also you know potentially what could

1152
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,040
be

1153
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,040
um an unintended consequence somewhere

1154
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,319
else or

1155
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,800
on the plus side where i'm mitigating

1156
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,480
and controlling those

1157
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,119
um even though i didn't realize it or i

1158
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:29,839
or i can

1159
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,599
implement those controls and know that

1160
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,520
so because a vulnerability

1161
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,599
is does not necessarily have to be

1162
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,800
addressed directly

1163
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,480
yeah um i like to talk about uh

1164
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,520
you know defense in-depth uh approach

1165
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,960
you know many times uh development teams

1166
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,960
may not have time to fix the

1167
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,319
vulnerability

1168
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,119
by making code changes and that's where

1169
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,079
as you explain

1170
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,680
abrasion uh we need to rely on security

1171
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,160
controls provided by the system

1172
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,319
or security and security controls

1173
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,640
provided by the network and organization

1174
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,520
wide level

1175
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,040
for example you know there is a

1176
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,119
cross-site scripting in some application

1177
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,119
the application is already in production

1178
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,040
and it would take let's say two person

1179
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,599
days to fix that vulnerability and then

1180
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,280
test it and release the code

1181
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,640
we don't have that much time hey

1182
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,920
let's go for vaf vaf is an

1183
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,359
organization wide you know control

1184
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,839
and it will prevent the injections from

1185
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,319
getting into the application even before

1186
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,800
those cross-site scripting payloads

1187
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,760
reach

1188
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,880
uh the vulnerable application we stop it

1189
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,520
so vap

1190
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,000
is a great control another good example

1191
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,680
i can think about to prevent

1192
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,440
is csp content security policy

1193
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,720
which is also implemented for entire uh

1194
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,200
application the enterprise application

1195
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,520
and it can prevent cross-site scripting

1196
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,160
vulnerabilities and because of these

1197
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,359
defense and div

1198
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,680
techniques such as csp or vaf we are

1199
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
actually giving our development teams

1200
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,160
enough time to thoroughly fix the

1201
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,119
vulnerabilities

1202
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,079
and test the fix

1203
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,520
well that scratched my edge this is what

1204
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,960
i was looking to hear and i really

1205
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,079
appreciate it trisha do you have

1206
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,520
anything

1207
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,920
no i this has been so fun like listening

1208
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,440
to both of y'all go back and forth

1209
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:25,760
because

1210
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,880
it's such an interesting concept and i

1211
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,119
i had never even thought about it as

1212
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,160
specific to the

1213
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,200
abstract side which is is huge it was

1214
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,760
such a

1215
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,079
great talk such a great talk it makes so

1216
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:38,800
much sense

1217
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,760
you know it's like it seems so obvious

1218
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,880
but i've never even

1219
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,079
thought yeah and uh trisha when i

1220
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,119
tell my developers and qa engineer i am

1221
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,040
the blue team or red team

1222
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,200
but you guys are my purple teaming now

1223
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,800
because you are now fully

1224
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,480
knowledgeable about the exploitation

1225
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
technique relevant to this application

1226
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,319
you are my purple teammate

1227
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,359
they get so excited and thrilled i can't

1228
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,800
even tell you

1229
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,960
love it again it's another theme that

1230
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,240
we've had with

1231
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,520
almost everything is you know this

1232
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,200
positive reinforcement and bringing

1233
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,240
people together

1234
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,920
and you know yes it's a very important

1235
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,960
aspect of our community 100

1236
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,160
yes so it's like extending

1237
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,640
our security community to development

1238
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,200
teams

1239
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,720
and utilizing on their skills like

1240
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,839
it's been 15 years i've written a code

1241
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,319
so you know it was kind of tricky for me

1242
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,079
to write that log scanner and when i

1243
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,839
asked my development team to do it

1244
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,400
they're like yeah boom half a day and

1245
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,800
