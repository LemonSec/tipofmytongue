right started sharing we still have four

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
minutes so we can sit and just talk

14

and have fun for four minutes sure

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
why not we are having so much fun over

16
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:00,960
here

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,239
we were we were trying to figure out

18
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,000
what wade's russian name would be

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,040
earlier i told him if he had been in

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,479
russian class the teacher probably would

21
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,400
have called him vlad

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
it's probably yeah and actually that

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
has different uh like um

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,080
different way different full names so

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,840
vlad can be vladislav

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,880
or uh it can be vadim but it's not vlad

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,400
it's like

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
vedic i guess so yeah yeah

29
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,640
yeah yeah yeah you get your choice yes

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,479
yes i can be called like nasty anastasia

31
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,640
stacia stacy so it's

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,360
it's too many it's too many uh it's many

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,079
options

34
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,000
yeah well it's one of the fun names for

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,520
sure yeah yeah

36
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
but it's not russian it's it's ukrainian

37
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,840
oh it's ukrainian

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,840
yes did not know that i definitely

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
thought it was russian because of like

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,640
you know grand duchess oh

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,680
slavic names are like similar so yeah

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,360
yeah they're all very similar um

43
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,200
actually you know what's surprising

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,639
about russian is that there's a lot of

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,758
cognates to french

46
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,319
because of that whole period where they

47
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
were trying to be western european

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
and russian and they want to only speak

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,040
french and then it didn't quite work and

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
then

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,280
the next generation rose up and we're

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
like no we're russians and we're going

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
to speak russian but by the way

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,160
did anyone write any of that down

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
because we're missing a lot of words and

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
so they just filled it in with

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,319
the real expelling of french words

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
and basically i don't know impressions

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,760
in

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,000
speak french good right now

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,920
so they went oh no they forgot they're

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,559
french which is good

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,879
oh ipv6 yes

64
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,720
i'm not going to know more than what any

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,239
of the talks are about so it's

66
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,480
just not surprising for us it's kind of

67
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,920
like luck of the draw over here

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,720
i've been avoiding the ipv6 train like

69
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
the plague because i'm like i do not

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,239
need one more thing

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,400
i do not need one more thing yeah and

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
it's more confusing when you know

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,959
ipv4 when you know how it when you know

74
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,800
the structure when you know how it works

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
and then bam ipv6 more numbers

76
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,080
and there they even have like

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,159
words in that and yeah oh my gosh you

78
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,920
threw the letters in there it's twice as

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,079
long

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,879
no no i don't like it i'm pretty sure i

81
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,959
failed the ipv6 part network plus

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,239
so uh that just shows if i ever

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,599
encountered an environment that was all

84
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,599
ipv6 i would just quit the pen test i'd

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,799
like no i'm done i don't know

86
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,519
i don't know that's good that's good

87
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,280
security then i'll start implementing

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,760
that

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,239
switching everything to ibp have a lot

90
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,519
of learning to do

91
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,760
because we don't like change we're like

92
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
you don't have a d

93
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,959
no can you implement a d because we

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,959
could mess that up really easily but

95
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
we don't play with octa

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
yeah in future you can and can you

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,159
implement ipv6 please

98
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
we have no id in ipv6 i'm like i'm out i

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,760
quit

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,079
usually

101
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,000
there's a couple big companies out there

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
that have said they've implemented it

103
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,279
completely

104
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,000
but i think it's just like bang right so

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,639
like

106
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
google google facebook i guess

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,520
yeah i need to take it i need to take it

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
so bad all right well here we go

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
good luck i'm sure you don't need it

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
stage is yours yay hello grim khan

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
um hope you are doing great today and

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
thank you everyone who came to listen to

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,919
me

114
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,919
and thank you grim khan for giving me

115
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,400
the opportunity to speak today

116
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
uh my main goal of this presentation

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,240
is raising awareness of using ipv6

118
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
and that's why i want to talk about it

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,360
in a context

120
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,800
of cyber security so

121
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,039
small introduction first my name is

122
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:09,919
stacey

123
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,360
or nasty or anastasia you can choose

124
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,039
more convenient for you

125
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,360
i already have my master's degree in

126
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,320
information

127
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,199
system security and i've been working as

128
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,479
a security analyst

129
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,639
in a sock team for almost a year

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,919
today i'm going to cover a bit of ipv6

131
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,800
introduction

132
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,919
types of ipv6 addresses

133
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,560
how to get and implement ipv6 at your

134
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
home environment and

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,320
also reconnaissance in ipv6 networks

136
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
every device in the internet is

137
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
identified through its own internet

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,120
protocol address

139
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,320
in order for internet communication to

140
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,960
work

141
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,800
and actually that can be compared with

142
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,199
zip codes and street addresses you need

143
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,840
to know

144
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,479
in in order to mail a letter

145
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,280
ipv6 is the latest version of the

146
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,560
internet protocol

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,600
and ipv4 is the version that we are all

148
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,400
familiar with

149
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,199
more the addresses look different

150
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,039
statuses look different within these

151
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,479
protocols

152
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,000
the ipv6 has 128-bit

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
adjacent scheme what means that it

154
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
consists

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
of eight groups of four hexadecimal

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,039
digits

157
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,199
with the groups separated by column and

158
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,560
for comparison

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,560
uh the ipv4 has 32-bit adjacent scheme

160
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,160
so it consists of four groups of decimal

161
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
digits with the groups

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
separated by dots but the key difference

163
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,599
between the versions of the protocol is

164
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,479
that ipv6 has

165
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,840
significantly more address space

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,520
to make uh to make our lives better

167
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,560
ipv6 addresses can be shortened

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,599
and let's take a look on some examples

169
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,199
so first if they're a string of zeros

170
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,319
then you can remove them you can only do

171
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,280
this once

172
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,880
and uh your ipv6 device

173
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,000
will fill up the remaining space with

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,520
zeros

175
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,560
until it has a 128 bit address

176
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,520
then if you have a hextet group that

177
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,680
means a group of four hexadecimal

178
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,720
digits with four zeroes uh

179
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
then you can remove those and leave a

180
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,120
single zero

181
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,080
and again your ipv6 device will add the

182
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,720
remaining

183
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
three zeros and finally leading zeroes

184
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
can also be removed and eventually by

185
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
removing these zeros we get a nice short

186
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,319
ipv6 address

187
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,080
ipv6 is very important for the long-term

188
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,759
health of the internet

189
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,680
uh there are only about 3.7 billion

190
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,120
public ipv4

191
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
addresses and this may sound a lot

192
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,919
but it isn't even one ap address for

193
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,039
each person on the planet and

194
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:17,919
considering

195
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,000
people have more and more internet

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,520
connected devices

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
the lack of ip addresses is already

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,879
proven to be a serious problem

199
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
um this may not affect those in well-off

200
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,360
develop

201
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,958
developed countries just yet but

202
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,719
developing countries are

203
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,519
led already running out of ipv4

204
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,640
addresses

205
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,760
and uh the expanded addressing capacity

206
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,958
of ipv

207
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,839
uh of ipv6 enables support and

208
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,600
connectivity

209
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
um for a huge range of new devices

210
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,839
such as phones laptops iot devices

211
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,279
also eventually unbelievable amount of

212
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,880
ap addresses gives

213
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,440
an opportunity to get rid of network

214
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
addressing translation or net

215
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
and that actually means that every

216
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,480
device has

217
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,760
its own public address ipv6

218
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
public addresses are more known as

219
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,959
global

220
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
unicast addresses and they are

221
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,399
equivalent

222
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,600
of the public addresses in ipv4 networks

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
global addresses are routable on the

224
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
internet

225
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,560
but does it mean that ipv6 has no

226
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,839
private addressing

227
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,440
well as you can see on the slide it

228
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,920
doesn't

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
in ipv4 internal in apv4

230
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,080
internal addresses use the reserved

231
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
number ranges

232
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,839
and these addresses are not routed on

233
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,800
the internet

234
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,000
and reserved for internal networks

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,600
ipv6 has two internal address types

236
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,800
link local and uniqlo

237
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,959
link local addresses are used to

238
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,640
communicate between hosts

239
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,959
on the same link they are meant to be

240
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,160
used inside

241
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,360
an internal network they are not routed

242
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,720
on the internet or even internal network

243
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,959
they are restricted to a particular

244
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,000
physical link

245
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
which is an electronic connection

246
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,279
between

247
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,560
between our devices also link local

248
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,279
addresses

249
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,480
are self-assigned that means they do not

250
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
require a presence of

251
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,560
a dhcp server in the network

252
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
uniqlo are meant to be used inside

253
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,120
an internal network as well they are not

254
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,800
routed on the internet

255
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,079
but they are routed on the on the

256
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,640
internal network basically they are

257
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
equivalent

258
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,680
to the internal ipv4 addresses

259
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,560
but according to my research unique

260
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,240
local addresses are not yet commonly

261
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,880
implemented

262
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,640
so i mentioned before that with ipv6

263
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,079
we don't need net anymore but you may

264
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:02,399
have

265
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,880
question want my network be less secure

266
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
without net

267
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,440
translating addresses does not provide

268
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
any security benefits

269
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,079
and in many cases not require

270
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,640
an outgoing connection to be present

271
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,440
before

272
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,320
it will allow an incoming connection and

273
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,360
this

274
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
stateful packet filtering can be enabled

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,160
for ipv62

276
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,000
also a pv6 makes possible end-to-end

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
connection without

278
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,560
intermediate devices and that can hinder

279
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,239
man in the middle attack for example

280
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,360
i know you've been already thinking how

281
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,320
can i use ipv6 in my home network can i

282
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
implement it by myself

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,120
of course first way to do that is

284
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
asking your internet service provider

285
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,959
for ipv6

286
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,079
and for example on the world world ipv6

287
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,040
lounge website you can check providers

288
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,000
that joined

289
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,560
ipv6 launching and can provide you with

290
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,959
a pv6 address

291
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,680
but what if you don't have a provider in

292
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,800
your city that supports ipv6

293
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
and by the way that's exactly the

294
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,639
situation i have

295
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,839
because i don't have any ipv6 provider

296
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,440
in my hometown

297
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
and that's not a problem because

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,560
hurricane electric exists uh it is a

299
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,079
global internet provider

300
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,120
that provides cpv6 as well and you can

301
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
just fill out the form on

302
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
a tunnel broker website and get yourself

303
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,279
global ipv6 with

304
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,839
64 subnet mask free

305
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,560
but what 64 subnet mask gives us

306
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,600
well it gives us an opportunity to have

307
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,720
a subnet with that

308
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
amount of addresses and i know that

309
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,760
impressive

310
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,320
so now is the main question uh with that

311
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,880
amount

312
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,320
of addresses and subnets that the person

313
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,519
or organization can have with ipv6 is it

314
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,880
even possible to make

315
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,440
network reconnaissance in ipv6 networks

316
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,519
i marked that as yes but it's not that

317
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,440
simple

318
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,399
uh the scale of the of the address

319
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,440
scanning task

320
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,200
is so large in ipv6 that that attackers

321
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,560
must be

322
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,279
very creative to be good enough and

323
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,399
simply sweeping an

324
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,839
entire 64 ipv6 subnet would just be

325
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,120
impossible

326
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,880
but that doesn't mean that we cannot use

327
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,680
patterns or documented techniques for

328
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
for example white or gray box pen test

329
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,600
techniques and

330
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,920
some note white box pen test techniques

331
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
involves sharing full information in

332
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,519
system full network

333
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,399
and system information with a tester in

334
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
a gray box

335
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,560
only limited information is shared with

336
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,360
the tester

337
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,839
and there is also a black box pen test

338
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,480
where no

339
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,079
information is provided at all

340
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,160
so first thing we need to take into

341
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,360
account is

342
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,720
patterns they are used in infrastructure

343
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
networks to

344
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
simplify the management so it can be

345
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,279
easy to remember

346
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,639
and what we can use uh the first

347
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,480
thing that we can use it's a low byte

348
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,079
addresses in which

349
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,880
most of the bytes are set to zero except

350
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,040
for the least significant byte

351
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
also there are ipv4 based addresses in

352
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,680
which

353
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,199
the ipa4 address is embedded in ipv6

354
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,600
and i know it looks weird but that

355
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
exists and there's nothing we can do

356
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,560
about

357
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,880
uh also we can use server sport

358
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,000
addresses

359
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
it's simply a using of tcp or udp port

360
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,720
of the main service

361
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,279
running on that host and also where the

362
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,120
addresses which encodes

363
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,240
which encode works

364
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,320
let's move on to techniques to

365
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,920
techniques

366
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,079
if the target is a local network the

367
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,920
following techniques are found to be

368
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,120
effective

369
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,680
and i'll cover a bit later uh local

370
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,720
address scanning

371
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,800
and traffic snooping the other hand if

372
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,639
the target is a remote network

373
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,560
these techniques on the slide may be

374
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,040
used and i'm going to describe in one in

375
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,079
more details

376
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,399
dns brute forcing remote address

377
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,839
scanning and

378
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
dns reverse mappings

379
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,440
let's start with dns brute forcing it's

380
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,600
actually the easiest one this technique

381
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
may be employed just by looking for

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,279
dns qual a records against commonly used

383
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,320
hostnames

384
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,199
quad a points a domain name and quite a

385
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,320
record

386
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,399
points a domain name to an ipv6 address

387
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,720
for this purpose we can use command

388
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,600
scanning tool

389
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,320
called in map it has a nice feature

390
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
called in map script engine

391
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,360
so we can download dns brute force dns

392
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,560
brute script

393
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,560
and use it with with map

394
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,920
firstly let's deal with some terms on

395
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,199
that slide

396
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,240
a dns pointer record or ptr

397
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,920
ptr provides the domain name associated

398
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,360
with an ip address

399
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
and in our case ptr record is exactly

400
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,800
the opposite

401
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,880
of the quad a record which provides

402
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,240
the ip address associated with a domain

403
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
name

404
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,360
the domain name arpa is a top level

405
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,079
domain

406
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,399
in a domain name system dns of the

407
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,279
internet

408
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,639
and ip6 that airport zone is used for

409
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,880
mapping ipv6 addresses to

410
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,000
internet domain names and what is more

411
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
what is the most interesting about this

412
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
technique is that it can

413
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,440
uh greatly reduce the ipv6 address

414
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
search space

415
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,639
basically uh we can walk through the ip6

416
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,519
airport zone

417
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,880
corresponding to a target network and

418
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,039
issuing queries for ptr records

419
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,439
corresponding to the domain names

420
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,319
and if there were ptr records for any

421
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:12,799
host

422
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
starting with the domain name the

423
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
response would contain a code of zero

424
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,959
that means no error otherwise

425
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,439
the response would contain a code of 4.

426
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,119
we can try ptr scan within map as well

427
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,240
there is another

428
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
script for that called

429
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,960
ap6 erp scan also we can

430
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,440
just use some of the web tools for

431
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,240
example

432
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,400
this one is a reverse dns tool on

433
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,520
network tools website

434
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
before address canyon you should

435
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
consider which subnet prefix to choose

436
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,799
a typical site might have uh 48

437
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,080
or 64 subnets to be scanned and

438
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,520
however we can we can try to reduce the

439
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,120
search space

440
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320
by guessing likely address plan schemes

441
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,440
or using

442
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,240
any clues that might exist from other

443
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,280
sources

444
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,039
or observations and for example

445
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,720
there are a number of documents

446
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,320
available online like

447
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,280
rfc5375

448
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,240
that provide recommendations for the

449
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,039
allocation of address space

450
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,679
and address plans might include

451
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,200
addresses that

452
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,320
run from low number upwards use building

453
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,960
numbers

454
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,799
in hexadecimal decimal form or use vlan

455
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,200
numbers

456
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,039
the scan 6 tool from ipv6 toolkit

457
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,840
supports

458
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
sweeping address ranges and can also

459
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,000
use all the address patterns and this

460
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,520
tool can be found in default

461
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,640
repositories on

462
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,960
uh debian debian based systems

463
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,679
what about local networks firstly we can

464
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,400
try to

465
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,280
obtain information via traffic snooping

466
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
aka sniffing

467
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,760
uh this can help in discovering active

468
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,480
hosts

469
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,120
in a number of ways firstly each

470
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,280
captured packet will reveal

471
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,840
the source and destination of the packet

472
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,120
of course

473
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,039
secondly the capture traffic may

474
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,360
correspond to network protocols

475
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,880
that transfer information such as host

476
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,120
or router addresses network topology

477
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,000
information

478
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,919
etc ipv6

479
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,880
address scanning in local area networks

480
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,840
um

481
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,760
to some extent could be considered

482
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
a completely different problem than

483
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,760
scanning a remote ipv6 network

484
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,799
the main difference is in usage of link

485
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,280
local multicast addresses

486
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
this is a replacement of ipv4 broadcast

487
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,640
addresses

488
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
and multicast is a group of addresses

489
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,679
but

490
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,400
not all addresses in a subnet and such

491
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,320
multicast addresses can relieve

492
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,799
the attacker of searching for unicast

493
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,320
addresses in a large

494
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,639
ipv6 address space

495
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,919
so an attacker can simply send

496
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,880
pro packets to the to the all nodes link

497
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,720
local multicast address

498
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,400
and get a reply from all active hosts

499
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,720
but i want to emphasize one more time

500
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,559
this can help with discovering

501
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,200
link local addresses only so it will

502
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,320
work only in the private networks um

503
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,559
there are a variety of publicly

504
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,600
available

505
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,840
uh local apv six network address

506
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,880
scanners

507
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,000
uh current versions of nmap implement

508
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
this functionality

509
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,799
uh also a live six tool from ipv6 attack

510
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,520
to kit

511
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,080
implements this too and also it can be

512
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,600
found in repositories for

513
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,640
debian based systems

514
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,919
also i want to mention v they are

515
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,200
computer science these students who work

516
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,480
in apvc on ipv6 scanner for their phd

517
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,679
project and this one helped me a lot to

518
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,159
find

519
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,039
a right path for my talk and i found

520
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,600
very helpful the material about

521
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
the materials about ipv6 security that

522
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,039
we

523
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,159
shared on their github as well so i had

524
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,120
and also i highly highly uh recommend to

525
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,960
check out their twitter account because

526
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,600
weep was their research updates there as

527
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,840
well

528
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,679
let's move to mitigation part ipv6

529
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,200
address scanning attacks can be

530
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,000
mitigated

531
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,799
in a number of ways first thing that we

532
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,440
can do

533
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,799
is to limit pattern addresses

534
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,520
uh then we can try to employ intrusion

535
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,880
prevention systems

536
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,240
or to enforce ipv6 packet filtering

537
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,559
where it's possible of course

538
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,120
we can try to avoid use of sequentially

539
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,159
addresses when using dhcp v6

540
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,480
and ideally the dhcp v6

541
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,840
server would allocate

542
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
random addresses from a large pool

543
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,880
we can use the default 64 size

544
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,559
ipv6 subnet prefixes and

545
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,760
in general just avoid being predictable

546
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,080
in the way addresses are assigned

547
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,000
what about block listing ipv6 hosts are

548
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,360
generally

549
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,320
able to configure any number of ipv6

550
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,000
addresses within

551
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,600
their 64 local subnet and in the event

552
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
of malicious activity you should block

553
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,360
list at least

554
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,159
the 64 from which you have detected

555
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,919
malicious activity

556
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,000
and depending on the specific provider

557
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
internet provider

558
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,880
the attacker might have control of

559
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,760
prefixes

560
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,840
of any lens between 48 and 64.

561
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,440
so if malicious activity persists after

562
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,600
block listing the offending 64 subnet

563
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
you may want to block shorter prefixes

564
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,640
hence

565
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
larger blocks of addresses in this

566
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,919
example

567
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,000
i used ip6 tables which is a pv6 version

568
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,440
of iptables

569
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,559
and iptables is a linux command

570
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,559
line utility tool to manage the

571
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,000
ip packet filter rules

572
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,440
what else we can do or we should know to

573
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,000
be able

574
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,840
to secure ourselves first of all

575
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,200
knowing the syntax makes it much easier

576
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
to quickly know how to deal with a

577
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,559
security breach

578
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,679
or implement necessary measures and as

579
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,000
you can

580
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,159
see since the syntax can be confusing

581
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,039
with uh

582
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,600
can be confusing because of the

583
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
shortening techniques that i mentioned

584
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
earlier

585
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,240
uh hit the off button shutting off ipv6

586
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,760
capabilities when you

587
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,520
are not using it may seem obvious

588
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,159
but it not but it may not be that easy

589
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:12,640
because

590
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,200
a number of programs have already been

591
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,760
configured to work with ipv6

592
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,919
and just as many may already have the

593
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:20,960
protocol turned

594
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,720
on automatically by default so

595
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,039
please check double check and triple

596
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,880
check your environment

597
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
to ensure ipv6 is enabled only when it

598
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,720
is used

599
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,000
even with large portions of network

600
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,840
disabled for ipv6 there is still this

601
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,400
threat

602
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,600
of unwanted ipv6 visitors and when that

603
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,159
happens

604
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,039
organizations should know how to kill it

605
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,120
before it can infect

606
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,880
others within the network

607
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,200
this is the situations this is the

608
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,559
situation

609
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,159
uh where no an ipv6 syntax can be useful

610
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,559
particularly for setting up effective

611
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,520
firewalls and

612
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,320
traffic filters

613
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,000
what continued ipv6 adoptions means for

614
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,559
internet security

615
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,000
attackers tend to set their sides on new

616
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,640
targets

617
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,960
only when they become worthy of their

618
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,840
attention

619
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,799
and the same goes for ipv6 sap vi

620
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,120
adoption becomes more prevalent

621
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,000
threat actors are increasingly using its

622
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
addresses as an attack vector

623
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,840
if threat intelligence feeds haven't

624
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,200
prepared to analyze ipv6 addresses

625
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,679
they are faced with big black holes in

626
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,200
their data sets

627
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,320
and the ability to monitor anomalous

628
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,360
web traffic is one of the keys to

629
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,320
detecting a bridge

630
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,600
coming to the end i want to say that

631
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,159
device

632
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,360
producers should also be aware of ipv6

633
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,400
adoption

634
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
this is especially true for iot devices

635
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,080
the amount of internet connected iot

636
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,279
devices grows

637
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,159
exponentially so millions even billions

638
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:10,640
of new

639
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,799
ap ip addresses will be needed

640
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,360
and ipv6 will help with that but

641
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,720
manufacturers should

642
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,760
make sure the devices are designed uh

643
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,919
with the capabilities to support analyze

644
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,039
secure it and ipv6 may have been

645
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,279
a long time coming but it's too late in

646
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,240
the game to ignore

647
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,039
on this slide you can find links and

648
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,640
tools that you might have missed

649
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,400
and also where you can find me to have a

650
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,039
chat i'm always glad to learn by helping

651
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,440
people

652
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,039
and resolving interesting cases

653
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,799
and i wanted to say special thanks to

654
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,760
margaret sertac the digital overdose

655
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,200
community and of course

656
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,840
grimcon for support and for the

657
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,399
feedbacks

658
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,279
i'm ready for your

659
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
all questions we do have at least one

660
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,120
and that was how can um oh my gosh

661
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,200
wait i lost it everyone this is my fault

662
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,400
completely it was a bit

663
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,720
up uh what are the methods an

664
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,679
organization can use to implement ipv6

665
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,120
if that's something that you can do

666
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,960
yes we can do that in our environment

667
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,279
and there are at least

668
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,559
four methods for approach that

669
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,760
uh the organization can use to migrate

670
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,919
to ipv6 like um we can use just native

671
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,320
implementation so just using ipv6

672
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,480
without ipv4 support

673
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,799
um we can uh use a pv6 tunneling

674
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,559
it's just a tunnel for in ipv4

675
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,039
uh so roughly speaking it's something

676
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:57,760
like uh

677
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,960
and vpn uh so you establish a tunnel

678
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,799
between your um

679
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,600
and devices ipv6 and the end device like

680
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
for example your web server or something

681
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,399
like that

682
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,679
um also we can use

683
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,120
uh net 64. uh

684
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,480
it's just the translation ipv6 address

685
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,360
two ipv4 address in case if

686
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,799
uh your server or your device

687
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,720
that you are going to connect to uh

688
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,279
doesn't support ipv6

689
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,520
um i guess that's it

690
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,360
so that was so awesome i feel like

691
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,840
thank you i'm just sitting here like

692
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,080
inside

693
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,440
i've avoided this for so long but like

694
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,640
this is one of those things you guys

695
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,760
that if you don't understand it you just

696
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
got to break it down into its teeny tiny

697
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,520
easy to digest bits

698
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,799
until it's something that you're

699
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,120
comfortable with um

700
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,200
what is one of the reasons you would

701
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,440
advocate going to ipv6

702
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,240
over ipv4 um you mean

703
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,159
like completely adopting why like why

704
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,760
why is it better

705
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,799
why is it uh actually

706
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,000
the secure part of ap6 is

707
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,039
like the the securing of ipv6 is better

708
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,980
because for example

709
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,440
[Music]

710
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,200
ipv6 supports uh end-to-end encryption

711
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,039
uh like we familiar with ipv ipsec

712
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,320
protocol and you can use it with ipv6

713
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
because ipv6 is supports

714
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,760
supported by default so we can uh use

715
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,760
end to end encryption like automatically

716
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,399
and even even bother about it

717
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,080
so yeah go ahead back your slides up to

718
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,919
the one where so people can contact you

719
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,760
so we can get you on them

720
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,399
yes oh and also i will be active in

721
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,559
discord grim com discord like

722
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,559
an hour or two so if you have some

723
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,158
questions you can send me right away

724
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,120
see we got any more questions

725
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,559
have you come across any tools that you

726
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,240
haven't been able

727
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,080
are any tools that haven't been able to

728
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,799
convert to ipv6 that were critical

729
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,399
like um actually i faced with

730
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,559
implementation ipv6 in my home

731
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,520
environment

732
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,919
i was trying to use the pv6 from tunnel

733
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,360
broker

734
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,919
but and they when you're trying to

735
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,760
implement that in your own environment

736
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,159
they

737
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,679
they have the examples for different

738
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,919
operational systems and devices how you

739
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:48,960
can implement that

740
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,520
and i was trying to do that on my mac

741
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,399
and

742
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,000
uh interestingly that i

743
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,279
couldn't do that uh even i didn't get

744
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,320
any errors

745
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,960
i even used wireshark just to find out

746
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,000
what was the problem

747
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
and the packets would go away to the

748
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,240
ipv6 um

749
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,480
server but i didn't get any replies and

750
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,919
i'm still investing in

751
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,240
i've been still investigating what was

752
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,480
the problem with that

753
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,039
but i think it may be use uh it may be

754
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,360
simpler with some linux devices

755
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,799
or windows okay i definitely want to set

756
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,279
up

757
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,279
grou go grab some addresses and set some

758
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,039
stuff at my house now that i know that

759
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,640
yeah but

760
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,960
you should probably have a static ipv4

761
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,919
addresses and

762
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,519
open a cmp port and open uh if i'm

763
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,720
not mistaken the tcp port 40 for the

764
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,880
establishing ipv6 tunneling

765
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,000
okay with besides just

766
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,080
that mac problem did you have any other

767
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,600
big concerns or big problems when

768
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,159
setting it up at your house

769
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,080
no no the main problem is always syntax

770
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,240
so uh i think in my organization

771
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,880
many of us avoid ipv6 because they don't

772
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,840
know how to

773
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,519
migrate or they don't know how to

774
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,760
implement it correctly

775
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,279
or uh how to set up firewalls correctly

776
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,279
so yeah okay i got one good one is there

777
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:15,840
any

778
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,120
um is there any configuration that

779
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
where something can go wrong so say the

780
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,799
sysadmin configures something wrong in

781
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,880
ipv6 that would leave a big security

782
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,760
hole

783
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,039
something like that one that

784
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,159
um actually uh

785
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,919
your devices i think uh already support

786
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
link local addresses even if you don't

787
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,679
know that

788
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,399
so for example if a cyber

789
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,159
if an attacker cyber actor

790
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,360
managed to connect to your home

791
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,720
environment

792
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,360
they can establish uh they can find out

793
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,960
all of your link local addresses and

794
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,519
they can even establish the ipv6 tunnel

795
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,480
without uh like without any

796
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,519
any footprints in in your

797
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,440
i don't know maybe some detection uh

798
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,960
deduction systems

799
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,880
sounds like persistence on a platter to

800
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,399
me

801
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,719
yeah right up your alley

802
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,799
see have you encountered any

803
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,799
exploitation of ipfc's

804
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,399
ipv6 in the wild in your work

805
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,479
not yet not for now

806
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,120
it's always golden until the first one

807
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,200
yes yes exactly

808
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,320
i have not as well meryl you got you got

809
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,440
anything over there

810
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,200
nothing i'm going to tell you about

811
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,480
that's for me

812
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,880
to find

813
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,279
why did you focus on it uh

814
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,399
because eventually we we will use the

815
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,760
ipv6

816
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,800
like there's not any way back

817
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,760
uh and we need to start to learn that

818
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,480
now

819
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,679
before it it will be like widespread

820
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,639
for example uh according to google

821
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,679
statistics

822
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,040
uh ipv6 implemented for

823
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,679
uh implement i implemented for like 35

824
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,359
for 2021 year and grows like

825
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,480
10 for like each five years i guess

826
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,000
so it's not it's not a long way

827
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
okay so you think in our do you think

828
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,918
eventually so like

829
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,040
how's that gonna work are they just

830
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,520
eventually going to push ipv4 out

831
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,560
or like are we just going to like stop

832
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,800
like our isp's just going to stop

833
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,040
providing it like how is this going to

834
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,000
is it going to go away like behind like

835
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,400
nat gateways or

836
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
i think that would be approached

837
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,400
smoothly

838
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,720
like i said there is a couple masses

839
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,920
like uh

840
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,119
ipv6 tunnels that i mentioned before so

841
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,320
you can use

842
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,839
an ipv6 and ipv4 uh

843
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,480
bose oh and i forgot to mention there is

844
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,040
uh

845
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,440
a dual stack settings for your routers

846
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,200
so you can use an ipv4

847
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,480
and ipv6 simultaneously not not without

848
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,800
tunneling just like

849
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,560
two two separate routes

850
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,480
i'm afraid i'm afraid foreign

851
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,839
it's not going to happen in the five

852
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,800
years or 10 or 20 i guess

853
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,480
i know but still one day someone's i'm

854
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
going to call for support

855
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,640
like what's your ip address i'm like um

856
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,560
here we go yeah yeah

857
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,119
just i just imagine like copying ipv6

858
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,760
addresses

859
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,480
into like my splunk searches or or

860
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,240
right like it used to be so easy i could

861
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,839
just memorize an address real quick and

862
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:14,880
type it but

863
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,560
one day i'm gonna get that super long

864
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,440
ipv6 address that doesn't have any

865
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,880
doesn't have any of the truncated

866
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,640
shrinking to it we need to have a

867
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,560
separate database for ipv6

868
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,079
yeah there's going to come a day where

869
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,280
i'm going to be looking and be like oh

870
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,000
my god

871
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,160
oh my god i see four octets oh my god

872
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,079
there's my pv4 over here guys

873
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,800
and we're gonna like i remember this

874
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,680
gold

875
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,880
you only had four numbers to memorize

876
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,280
so johnny did recommend a web app a

877
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,040
chrome app

878
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,480
browser plugin whatever called ipvfu

879
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,680
i haven't heard about it cool

880
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,000
it looks interesting not not fool food

881
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,320
like fubar like like foo fighters

882
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,680
fufatas yeah yeah man is calling cool

883
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,040
because like we're all fools when it

884
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,359
comes to ipv6 except for anastasia over

885
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,520
here

886
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,240
okay if you want to if you want to learn

887
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,400
more about ipv6 i would recommend

888
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,920
to not underestimate rfc documents

889
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,280
yes because i have i know

890
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,839
not so many people who would actually

891
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,079
read them

892
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,119
no youtube channel maybe

893
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,400
maybe this is a good learning

894
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,839
opportunity merrill you want to do a

895
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,800
pluralsight on

that's gonna need to come in yeah

908
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,000

910
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,520
