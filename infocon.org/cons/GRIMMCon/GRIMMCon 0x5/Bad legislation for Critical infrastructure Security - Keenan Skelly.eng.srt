1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,560
the title of your talk is groundhog's

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,520
day

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,320
it is and

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960
you're gonna really love this there's so

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,359
much

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,240
data that i actually made this part one

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
of groundhog day

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,960
there's going to be more i can't wait

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,920
it's going to be pretty happy that could

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,360
just be the same data over and over

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,680
again it can be the same talk i mean

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,960
that would be a good idea

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,719
and i might do that just for fun anyway

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,239
but now

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,480
blocks so your talk also ties into

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,440
the itsp magazine podcast you recently

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,559
launched

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,680
it does indeed the national blast we're

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
going to talk about that and some kind

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,120
of detail

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,440
um specifically as we start thinking

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,640
about you know

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,720
um critical infrastructure and critical

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,680
infrastructure protection i myself

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
really love all of the things that dhs

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
has done in the last 15 to 20 years

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,159
since they've been stood up

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
and all of the you know ways that

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
they've been trying to protect critical

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
infrastructure perhaps without the best

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,759
of budgets and without the best of

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,080
maybe um execution authority and

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,880
legislation

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
and i hope to continue to take on that

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,920

but i have seen people have really

73
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,760
remarkable setups right you know like

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
the green screen behind them so that

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,400
they can have

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,519
all of the digital media and just it's a

77
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,800
lot of work

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,640
there's a lot of work it is a lot of

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,040
work uh you know alyssa milla

80
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,400
miller earlier oh yeah

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,720
she's amazing oh yeah for sure

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,640
so keenan what's the story behind that

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,319
picture

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,760
behind that picture so when i was

85
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,159
um in the army i was going through eod

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,959
school which is

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,480
explosive ordnance disposal school and

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,519
um i was married and

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,400
my first husband steve who's really just

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,599
a great guy

91
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,879
and also kind of wanted to be an artist

92
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,560
for a little bit before he changed his

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
mind and wanted to be a police officer

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,760
and then i think he might have changed

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
his mind again and wanted to be a lawyer

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,840
but

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
you know we're all trying to figure that

98
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
out as i was going through eod school

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,879
um you know he was he was working a

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,319
couple of different things and

101
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,080
as we got closer and closer towards

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,400
graduation i always had a little bit of

103
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,439
a fascination with

104
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,599
the original painting which is the man

105
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,519
and businessman in a bowler hat

106
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,920
and so he replaced the apple he made his

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,640
own

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,959
and replaced it with a bomb with a very

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,439
nice long fuse and it

110
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,160
just reminds me of a time where i

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,358
definitely was going through some

112
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
adversity and trying to get through eod

113
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,160
school and

114
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,759
do all the things that i wanted to do in

115
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
the world and yet

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,280
there were wonderful people around me

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,120
who were there to support me and there

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
to help me and there to make sure that i

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,360
was the

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,400
best badass that i could be so that's

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
the story

122
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,080
it's beautiful i love that

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,199
it was so great

124
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,520
also on podcasts we have to give a shout

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
out to micah brown for the threat real

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,080
podcast

127
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,400
so a podcast that has already already

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,198
been in existence

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,500
we should just have a podcast con

130
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,800
[Laughter]

131
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
i think by the way that's kind of what

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,240
this is yeah kind of

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,600
just you know with a powerpoint which is

134
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
optional

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
is it optional i wish i would have known

136
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,280
that earlier

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,320
man it made my life easier that's okay

138
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,960
that

139
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
it's part one nobody made you do

140
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,719
anything keenan no one ever does

141
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840

142
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
here like i don't i'm trying to find

143
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
something pointy i can put on my head

144
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,800
that's the wrong thing hi keaton skelly

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,479
i am i'm here to talk to you a little

173
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,560
bit about living

174
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,720
with some very interesting legislation

175
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,479
and challenges that

176
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
the department of homeland security and

177
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,520
cisa and

178
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,160
others have you know really faced over

179
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
the last 15 years as we've been

180
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,960
trying to crack the nut of you know

181
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
critical infrastructure security

182
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,440
so the talk is called groundhog day

183
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
living with bad legislation for critical

184
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,560
infrastructure over

185
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,039
and over and over and over again um

186
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,919
uh who am i i'm an interesting

187
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,280
individual that had

188
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,319
um you know the the great fortune a long

time ago to work for the department of

190
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,280
homeland security

191
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
uh in the early days and really get to

192
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
see some of that critical infrastructure

193
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
being played out and that how we were

194
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,039
trying to protect it at the time but

195
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,919

216
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,919
let's get into some fun stuff in

217
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,960
overview

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,599
you know um i talk a little bit about

219
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,479
the fact that

220
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,240
critical infrastructure from the very

221
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
beginning has been

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,000
something that's very complicated in

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
terms of trying to legislate in terms of

224
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,199
trying to

225
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,759
wrap our minds around how we could

226
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,559
possibly

227
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,719
even begin to protect all of these

228
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,599
things

229
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,679
when you start tearing apart all of the

230
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,799
pieces that

231
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,279
include critical infrastructure it's

232
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,880
everything it's everything around us

233
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,080
it's our water

234
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,959
it's our energy it's our nuclear power

235
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,519
plants

236
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,480
it's how transportation gets a train

237
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,279
full of

238
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,600
something to you know the port of new

239
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,360
orleans and ships that around the world

240
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,839
and

241
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,519
and these are the very things that make

242
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,440
our global economy work

243
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
they're very very complicated and very

244
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,120
important

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
within dhs alone when we're talking

246
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,800
about critical infrastructure

247
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,240
you know we're talking about 16

248
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,839
different sectors and

249
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,839
each of these sectors is owned by

250
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,880
private

251
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,959
owners and operators these aren't

252
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,640
government folks these aren't

253
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,320
necessarily

254
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
you know dod folks although in some

255
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,040
cases dod does have some of the assets

256
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,800
so as dhs has grown over the last

257
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,360
you know number of years and started to

258
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
really address critical infrastructure

259
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,720
these are the kinds of things that they

260
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,959
have to really consider when it comes to

261
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
how do we protect the nation's critical

262
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
infrastructure and key resources

263
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,399
and how do we start applying cyber

264
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,519
security to

265
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,560
each of them knowing that that that kind

266
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:46,880
of

267
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,600
is the basis or at least a foundational

268
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,000
element

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
of each so as i said before i'm going to

270
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
break this down

271
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
into a couple of different parts so

272
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
today you're going to be very lucky

273
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
enough to see part number one

274
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,839
and i wanted to go back in time a little

275
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,959
bit and talk about

276
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,640
how we got from you know dhs started

277
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,200
here and then here we are right now and

278
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
we're doing all this great cyber

279
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
security stuff and we're really getting

280
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
engagement from owners and operators and

281
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
everybody's really interested because

282
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,040
of all of the threats that we've

283
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
experienced but

284
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,160
what what were all the things that

285
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
happened on the way to that

286
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
so that's something we're gonna talk

287
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
about a little bit more

288
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,600
now i i'm gonna go way back to the

289
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,160
beginning

290
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,360
so where where did it all start um

291
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,800
the department of homeland security

292
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,720
created in 2002

293
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,200
as a direct result of a lot of the

294
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
things that happened during 9 11.

295
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
um i myself was still in the military

296
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,959
during 9 11 and

297
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,720
experienced kind of the national

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
response plan of our country

299
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
played out at the highest levels

300
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,760
possible

301
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,480
and when dhs was created i was really

302
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,600
inspired to be

303
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,160
a part of that agency because there were

304
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
so many things that we just

305
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,480
hadn't really worked through in terms of

306
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,079
national response plan

307
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,240
that didn't include the department of

308
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,519
defense right

309
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,839
that did not include all of the other

310
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,640
things that

311
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,720
that had to happen to respond to

312
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
something that was so

313
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,120
um you know massive and so pervasive as

314
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,399
9 11.

315
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,600
so as dhs came out i myself

316
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
really really wanted to go work there

317
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
and i thought it was the

318
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
coolest thing ever i still love the

319
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
entire idea and i love homeland security

320
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,120
but

321
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
if you think about this from a more

322
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,880
broad perspective

323
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
imagine anybody anybody here who's

324
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
actually worked for the government

325
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,000
ever for more than five minutes imagine

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
that you're gonna take 22 agencies from

327
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
around the country

328
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,959
who all have their own you know

329
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,079
executive orders

330
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,440
that are ruling them their own

331
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
legislative bodies that are telling them

332
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,639
what they can and can't do their own

333
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,639
regulations their own

334
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
business processes and you're going to

335
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,959
bring all 22 of them together

336
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,760
and say we need you to get on a common

337
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,519
operating picture even though the

338
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,320
authorities that you may have had

339
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,560
may not be relevant anymore even though

340
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,079
the policies that you know

341
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,440
created you may not be relevant anymore

342
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,760
so we have to start thinking about

343
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
before we even get to where we are today

344
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,839
with dhs you have to remember what dhs

345
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,720
was built on

346
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,279
it was built on a conglomeration of

347
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,320
agencies

348
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
who all had something to offer to

349
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,680
protect the homeland

350
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,480
but but that by no means uh you know

351
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,800
means that it was a perfectly smooth

352
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,600
transition

353
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,920
right now i'm going to do something

354
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,680
really really uncool

355
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,160
i'm going to escape and make sure that i

356
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,079
turn microsoft outlook off because

357
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,000
i don't want you guys to be tortured

358
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,079
with that the rest of the time

359
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,279
we're on the talk here so you know what

360
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,959
happens next we have homeland security

361
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,399
we've got all of these agencies coming

362
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,519
together and saying

363
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,160
we have a tough job ahead of us we need

364
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,279
to figure out how

365
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,279
we can protect all of the things that

366
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,240
are important to our country

367
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,000
so a little bit later i think it was one

368
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,639
year later

369
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,440
almost exactly um critical

370
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
infrastructure came out and people said

371
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
you know i

372
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,399
i think we should probably be paying

373
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,240
attention to these things right the uh

374
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
nuclear power plants

375
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,800
the water treatment centers um you know

376
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,880
manufacturing

377
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,120
transportation all of these things i

378
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
think transportation was probably the

379
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
most

380
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,639
visible and everybody had eyes on it

381
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,920
because of 911

382
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,560
and because transportation security was

383
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,120
crucial

384
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
and something that you know we cared

385
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,279
about as americans so

386
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,880
the homeland security presidential

387
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
directive 7

388
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,839
came out and said you know what we need

389
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,519
to be able to identify

390
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,440
prioritize and protect critical

391
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
infrastructure and key resources within

392
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,639
this country

393
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
and part of that means we actually have

394
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,240
to figure out what that is

395
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
right what does that even entail is that

396
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,079
the mom and pop store down the street is

397
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,199
it

398
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,440
all of the transportation all the train

399
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,240
lines that run

400
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,040
across the entire country is it maybe

401
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,079
something as

402
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,560
you know complicated as chemical

403
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
facilities who actually

404
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,320
you know make chemicals that people can

405
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,160
make bombs out of

406
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,760
if you start really thinking about

407
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
critical infrastructure and what it is

408
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,839
the very basis of our economy and who we

409
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,880
are then

410
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,519
you start to realize how scary it is

411
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,560
when people

412
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,399
want to attack it or want to do bad

413
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,680
things against it

414
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,360
so not just identifying what those

415
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,519
things are but prioritizing them

416
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,560
you know at the time homeland security

417
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,279
was very

418
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,839
small still as an agency with not a

419
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,040
ginormous budget

420
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,839
and trying to identify which ones of

421
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,920
those things we could possibly go out

422
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
and protect

423
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
is not an easy task lots of lots of

424
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,399
algorithms and fighting and and gosh i

425
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,079
remember pat bert and i

426
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,680
i'm not sure anybody here will actually

427
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
remember her but

428
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,680
kudos to pat bert for um being an evil

429
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,760
genius way beyond her time

430
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,120
but then we had to figure out how to

431
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,360
protect them right because

432
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,040
it's important and it's part of our

433
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
country and who we are as

434
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,920
americans right

435
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,040
so no pressure

436
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,839
by the way dhs hey protect everything

437
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,399
um all of the things really seriously

438
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,279
everything

439
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,040
we want you to make sure that you're

440
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
protecting healthcare

441
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,079
we want to make sure you're protecting

442
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,839
communications we want to make sure that

443
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,800
the dams

444
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,920
and the water systems that you know take

445
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,519
water to

446
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,240
billions i'm sorry millions of people on

447
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,040
the west coast

448
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,120
that those things are never affected we

449
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,639
want to make sure that as

450
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,639
americans we are doing everything that

451
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,759
we can to protect

452
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
these key things that you know help us

453
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,680
thrive

454
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,480
as a country and help us move forward so

455
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,199
16

456
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,360
critical infrastructure sectors were

457
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,480
outlined

458
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
and dhs worked together with

459
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,839
a lot of different agencies to determine

460
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,199
agencies and uh i'll let bryson correct

461
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,199
me because i'm talking about in the old

462
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,639
school days but i believe they have a

463
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,839
new name now

464
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
but those sector specific agencies were

465
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,199
really designed to say

466
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,480
you have the responsibility to

467
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,519
ensure personnel physical

468
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,480
and information security of these things

469
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,759
right

470
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,040
we're not going to give you any budget

471
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,360
for that we're not going to

472
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,800
we're not going to give you any kind of

473
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,399
regulation for that but

474
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,639
through industry partnerships through

475
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,399
working together

476
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,040
this is your your task to go out and

477
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,880
figure out how we can make

478
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,720
critical infrastructure safer so that we

479
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,079
can make america

480
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,839
safer right

481
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,600
so you know i know my experience with

482
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,800
dhs but i also

483
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,160
i talked to a lot of people over the

484
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,680
last couple of days about you know

485
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,360
critical infrastructure and

486
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,680
in in the olden days and the difference

487
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,839
between information security and cyber

488
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,480
security as we really see it today

489
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,760
and for everybody who you know has been

490
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,839
in this field for a hot minute

491
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,760
information security and cyber security

492
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,359
are the same thing to us we've just you

493
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,039
know change the way that we look at it

494
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,280
and change the way that we deal with it

495
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,160
but right away within the department of

496
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,400
homeland security it was recognized that

497
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,480
information security and cyber security

498
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:28,799
were

499
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,960
extremely important when it came to

500
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
critical infrastructure

501
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
so you know wait what is this what is a

502
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,320
cyber thing maybe we should

503
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
get a little bit more involved in it and

504
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,400
try to figure out what we can do to help

505
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,559
right so

506
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,520
in 2013 um under the obama

507
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,400
administration

508
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,840
and executive order 13636

509
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
improving critical infrastructure cyber

510
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,760
security came out and i

511
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,720
i always feel like um you know this was

512
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,799
almost like the cart before the horse

513
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,120
kind of thing you know we decided we

514
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
figured out very

515
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,000
early in in you know general terms that

516
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
it was actually very important that

517
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
cyber security is established as an

518
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
underlying dependency for everything

519
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,120
that we do

520
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
there is not a single one of the 16 you

521
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,720
know

522
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,360
critical infrastructure sectors that

523
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,240
doesn't rely

524
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,840
almost entirely on information security

525
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,679
and cyber so how do we look at this

526
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,080
as something different as something

527
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,280
bigger

528
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,120
but something that's interconnected to

529
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
really everything that's happening

530
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,360
and i think this was a very key piece of

531
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
legislation or i'm sorry executive order

532
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,720
that came out that really

533
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,000
put into focus the importance of cyber

534
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
among other things but even at this

535
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
point you know it's 2013

536
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,160
there's lots of cyber uh breaches that

537
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,919
are happening lots of cyber attacks that

538
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:56,559
are happening

539
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,679
but there's still nobody really

540
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,400
responsible

541
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,880
for doing a whole lot about this right

542
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
lots of different agencies again came

543
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,600
together

544
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,240
to create dhs and some of them have

545
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,480
really great authority take the secret

546
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,360
service um

547
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,919
for example when it comes to the

548
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,640
treasury

549
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
and um you know financial transactions i

550
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,520
mean the skill that they had there was

551
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,960
was unmatched when they came into dhs

552
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,600
when you add other you know individuals

553
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,360
you add the ei sac you add

554
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,640
um the grid the nuclear facilities in

555
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,400
this country everybody had been working

556
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,200
really hard

557
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
and doing the things that they did best

558
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
but

559
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,720
the one thing at the the underpinning of

560
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,919
each of these sectors

561
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,320
is cyber security and how are we going

562
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,760
to address that as a nation

563
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,440
so when do we get our own agency to just

564
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,480
you know do this right

565
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,240
um 2018. so

566
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,960
in my mind i go back in time and i look

567
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,600
at

568
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,679
you know 2002 when dhs was first stood

569
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,320
up and

570
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,159
and all the difficulties that they had

571
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,320
just to bring you know 22 agencies

572
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,919
together and try to make that into

573
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,880
something

574
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,600
that worked and something that was not

575
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,360
perfect but was functional

576
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,400
and protecting our nation and then

577
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,559
a year later recognizing that critical

578
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,679
infrastructure

579
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,120
is the underpinning the the the piece

580
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,760
that connects

581
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
everything together all of those other

582
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,919
things and recognizing that

583
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,600
that critical infrastructure has to be

584
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
protected in a variety of ways and over

585
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,400
these

586
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
years from 2002 it took us until 2018 to

587
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,080
get to the point where

588
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,559
you know the csa act passed and we were

589
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,520
able to have

590
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,799
an organization that is focused entirely

591
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,679
on this and i

592
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,000
i really love that this quote here that

593
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,280
um you know

594
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,000
kris krebs said uh after it was passed

595
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,559
uh through

596
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,280
through congress and you know passing

597
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,679
this

598
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,480
represents real progress in the national

599
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,400
effort to improve our collective

600
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,840
efforts in cyber security this is such a

601
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,559
big deal

602
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,760
you know being able to recognize at at

603
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,640
this level of any kind of department

604
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,120
that

605
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,000
this is so crucial that it is actually

606
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,559
going to change the way that we function

607
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,640
as a government and in our private

608
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,799
partner you know relationships and and

609
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,919
everything that we're going to do

610
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,640
going forward

611
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,120
so it took a hot minute right for us to

612
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,240
get there

613
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,960
it took about a minute to get from 2002

614
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,280
um

615
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,240
all the way to 2018 where you know sisso

616
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,640
was stood up and it had the ability to

617
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,440
start

618
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
looking at you know government things

619
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,919
and looking at ways to engage the

620
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:50,799
private sector

621
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,039
and the public sector and the states and

622
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,000
figure out

623
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,919
what we could all do together how can we

624
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,159
all work together to make this mission

625
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,600
actually you know make sense but like

626
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,480
the agency had always had issues with

627
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,320
and i don't mean this you know

628
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,600
to be specific to dhs either i mean this

629
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,480
i would probably say is any massive

630
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,000
agency within the united states

631
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,880
government

632
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
is it's not always clear the things that

633
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,159
are absolutely needed until it's

634
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,840
absolutely clear

635
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,440
so some of the challenges that they face

636
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,520
for operating budget

637
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
you know if you go back and you look at

638
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,360
the last two to three years of operating

639
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,320
budget for

640
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,360
cisa it's two percent or less than two

641
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,200
percent of the entire operating budget

642
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,080
for the department of homeland security

643
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,960
so i i just that really makes me think

644
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,880
and i kind of stick on that you know

645
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,840
we we decided in 2013 that cyber

646
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
security was so crucial to critical

647
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,960
infrastructure that

648
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,120
an entire executive order was dedicated

649
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,159
to it

650
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,640
but when it came to actually funding the

651
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
arm of the department of homeland

652
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,679
security that had the ability to do

653
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,280
something about that

654
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,840
that funding just you know wasn't there

655
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,240
as much as maybe it should have been

656
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,760
and then there's always the question of

657
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,320
to regulate or not to regulate

658
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,400
and i i go back and forth with some of

659
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
my friends in the space on this

660
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,559
you know it's always it's always

661
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,559
wonderful if you can have a carrot

662
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,520
to offer to an owner operator to

663
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,039
somebody who

664
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,799
has a very you know restricted

665
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,720
way that they can charge people they

666
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,200
have a very restricted way that they can

667
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,600
you know hire people they have this this

668
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,360
budget that they're operating in

669
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,919
and cyber security is so far outside of

670
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,039
that budget that

671
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,880
that they can't even look at it so

672
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,120
you know in the history of dhs they've

673
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,279
gone kind of back and forth on you know

674
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,200
what a regulatory body

675
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,279
might look like and what it might not

676
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,960
look like and and how that works for

677
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,799
owners and operators and it's never an

678
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,440
easy and easy choice it's never

679
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,080
it's never easy to figure out what is

680
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,120
better

681
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,600
whether that's the carrot or the stick

682
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,120
in some cases

683
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,960
it definitely has to be the stick right

684
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
there has to be some kind of regulation

685
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,080
with teeth

686
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,480
otherwise there's no way that a company

687
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,279
can justify spending the money to do

688
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,279
the kinds of things that they need to

689
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,840
you know beef up

690
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,679
security and in the past we had programs

691
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,159
that were

692
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,559
tied to grant programs but those weren't

693
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,159
really dedicated to

694
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,880
helping the owner operator themselves

695
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,200
get

696
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,520
past the challenges that they face when

697
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,200
it comes to cyber security

698
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
and that's that's kind of heartbreaking

699
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,840
we've been able to provide grant funding

700
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,400
to

701
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
people who might respond to an incident

702
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
at those owners and operators

703
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,000
those pieces of critical infrastructure

704
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
around the country but we haven't been

705
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,480
able to really

706
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
impact people that work there and how

707
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,159
they can

708
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,760
get access to things um i believe i

709
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,679
had a conversation not that long ago

710
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,279
about some of the things that cesa's

711
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,960
been doing just to get materials

712
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,600
out there so that people can read them

713
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
and have access to them and start

714
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,559
you know dealing with what they have to

715
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,400
do to make their

716
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,880
you know a chemical plant or water

717
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,320
treatment facility a little bit more

718
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,520
secure

719
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,640
but if you are working in that facility

720
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,799
and you're already having a hard time

721
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,120
being able to you know pay everybody to

722
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,200
just do the jobs that they're doing

723
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,919
how easy is it for them to spend

724
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,120
additional time

725
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,279
to try to learn about these types of

726
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,440
things and this i'm not

727
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,520
please don't take i'm not sharp shooting

728
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,960
i'm just saying these are some of the

729
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,720
challenges that you have to think about

730
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,960
as we we talk about the history of how

731
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,240
we've gotten to where we are

732
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,039
now and and and why the legislation and

733
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,480
the things that are coming out

734
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,279
of the next couple you know um bills and

735
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,039
the executive order are so important

736
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,840
because these

737
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,720
are real challenges that have been faced

738
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,679
and that will

739
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,640
continue to be faced the authority to

740
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,520
execute

741
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,919
you know when you um as a government

742
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,640
agency

743
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,919
you you know you put your budget forward

744
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,919
and um as a new agency within a much

745
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,520
larger agency that's

746
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,279
also still trying to figure out what

747
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,520
agency it is because it's still 22 other

748
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,600
agencies

749
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
getting budget is a difficult thing to

750
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,080
do how how do you justify

751
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,480
that the budget for cyber security is

752
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,960
more important than the budget for

753
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,279
keeping you know nuclear power plant

754
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,799
safe or

755
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,440
or lng and lpg and all of these other

756
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,480
things that are

757
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,840
equally critical in america that are

758
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,240
critical infrastructure for us

759
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
how do you do that how do you fight with

760
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,840
the people in your own organization to

761
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,240
say

762
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,840
this is the most important thing

763
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,720
there's there's no easy answer to that

764
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,640
other challenges consistent political

765
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,200
support

766
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
and i think you know anybody who's

767
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,919
worked in government is going to say

768
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,840
well that's not just dhs that's every

769
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,320
organization and you're absolutely right

770
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,640
and there comes a time in government

771
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
specifically where we have to

772
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,000
acknowledge the fact

773
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,919
that some things are not political

774
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,159
cyber security is not political it has

775
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,679
nothing to do with

776
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,360
you know your political beliefs and it

777
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,039
has everything to do with

778
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,279
simply protecting our nation to the best

779
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,520
of our ability

780
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,039
and kudos all the kudos to mr krebs for

781
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,399
you know calling that out and having

782
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,240
that intestinal fortitude to say

783
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,720
it's not about right side or left side

784
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
that it's entirely about

785
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,840
doing the right thing struggles to

786
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,960
coordinate across

787
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,159
agencies you know with 16 sectors

788
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,320
and each of those sectors having a

789
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,919
different agency that

790
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,520
is you know designed to help it

791
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,279
regulate itself that is designed to help

792
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,039
it teach itself about

793
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,720
all of these things that it's designed

794
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,159
to get them all the information

795
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,600
that they need to do um

796
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,760
it's still it's still a process right i

797
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,000
know a lot of people here may or may not

798
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,399
have

799
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,120
participated in my my favorite thing the

800
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,719
interagency working group

801
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,039
and wow just wow that that's a whole

802
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:07,840
different

803
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,080
beast right there right um you know when

804
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,840
you're working across

805
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,559
multiple multiple agencies and not just

806
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,000
at a government level but at the

807
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,640
state and local level looking at tribal

808
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,279
level

809
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,200
trying to communicate with people and

810
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,440
make sure that everybody's needs are met

811
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,840
in a world where there isn't enough

812
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,799
funding

813
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,000
in a world where there isn't necessarily

814
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,640
an understanding from the the you know

815
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,760
the state the local

816
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,919
and the the tribal folks about what it

817
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,520
is they're supposed to be doing

818
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
and there isn't necessarily time on

819
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
anybody's part to make sure

820
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,919
that all of these agencies are doing

821
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,440
everything that they can

822
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,000
to work together and then of course the

823
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,919
the other challenge here is

824
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,159
how do you get that that business how do

825
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:52,960
you get that

826
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,000
oil refinery how do you get that um

827
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,480
nuclear power plant how do you get that

828
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,520
water treatment

829
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,159
facility that that only has two people

830
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,279
that work there

831
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,640
total at all how do you get them to

832
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,320
buy into something that says we want you

833
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,679
to do this and you have to do this

834
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,000
because

835
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,760
it's important for everyone but we don't

836
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
have anything to give you

837
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,200
and we don't have any way to train you

838
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,039
and we don't have any way

839
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,200
to ensure that you have everything that

840
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,799
you need

841
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,880
these are not easy challenges to

842
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,159
overcome and i

843
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,279
uh having been at dhs and and working

844
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,039
through some of these problems myself

845
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,480
i can only empathize with uh with cisa

846
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,799
and with dhs and know that they have

847
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,000
been really

848
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,840
truly doing that the best that they can

849
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,480
so what next what happens as we go

850
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,200
forward

851
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,919
you know i as i started putting this

852
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,760
talk together i talked a lot about you

853
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,360
know the groundhog day and how we keep

854
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,039
seeing the same things happen over and

855
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,000
over again and people

856
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
just talk about well we have to share

857
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,919
information right well we just if we

858
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,880
shared information

859
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
everything will be okay well i mean

860
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,240
sharing information is extremely

861
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440
important yes

862
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,600
but it's more than that it's the buy-in

863
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,080
of the american people it's the buy-in

864
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,600
of everyone in this country to say that

865
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,720
this is important

866
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,679
enough for us to make massive changes

867
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,240
here

868
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,679
and i think we're getting to that point

869
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,159
so what's different right now what's

870
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:20,720
different

871
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,159
today that wasn't there for the last

872
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,840
15 years well we've got cyber

873
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,480
at the white house we have people who

874
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,279
are just

875
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,120
dedicated to cyber at the white house

876
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
talking to the president talking to the

877
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,720
national security council talking to all

878
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,799
of these people about how important and

879
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,000
pervasive

880
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,799
cyber security is we have a president

881
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,200
who

882
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,640
is going head first into

883
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,039
executive orders into legislation into

884
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,880
things that are going to make

885
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,159
a change in how we perceive our security

886
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:56,880
especially

887
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,640
our cyber security our information

888
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,919
security

889
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,320
we continue to see nation states and

890
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,080
cyber criminals you know up in their

891
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
game we're starting to see

892
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,000
more and more ransomware attacks we're

893
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,200
starting to see

894
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,440
an underground of cyber criminals and

895
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,679
nation states working together

896
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,480
to to really change the way that cyber

897
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,399
crime is being done

898
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,960
international tensions are here it it is

899
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,519
time

900
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,640
it's time i read just the other day

901
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,760
um this you know this article and

902
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,039
um this quote right here i think it hits

903
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,360
right into the fundamental part of

904
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,960
everything that that i've been kind of

905
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,640
talking about up until this point and

906
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,760
that is

907
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,080
you know everybody right now wants to

908
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,279
boost cisa

909
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,840
because all of these attacks that we've

910
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,480
seen solar winds colonial pipeline

911
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,600
microsoft exchange cyber hijack

912
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,919
all of these things continue to build up

913
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,080
and

914
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,519
they're not the first right it's just

915
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,679
it's just the latest in a string of

916
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,720
things that we

917
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
we have to take care of and that we have

918
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,799
to look at more closely

919
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,120
so again as i started getting into this

920
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,240
talk and

921
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
i really decided that i had to break it

922
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,519
down into two things

923
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,600
i think and i truly believe this with

924
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,880
all my heart that

925
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,799
without understanding the history of how

926
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,039
we we got to this point and why we're

927
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:19,760
here

928
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
you can't really start to make changes

929
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,960
for the future

930
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,159
so the path of dhs the path of sysa the

931
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,000
path of critical infrastructure

932
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,600
and critical infrastructure security in

933
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,440
this country has not been an easy one

934
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,120
and it's one that's being written every

935
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
single day and when you think about the

936
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,000
sheer

937
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,600
capabilities that have to be thrown

938
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
at that that beast just to make sure

939
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,600
that we're doing the right thing

940
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,640
it's a lot and it's a lot to think about

941
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,159
so for right now this is my high level

942
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:50,880
overview

943
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,519
of what um what i hope is going to be

944
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,080
about

945
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,799
two more uh two more kind of series here

946
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,840
that we can talk about

947
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,519
and that i plan to talk about on my

948
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,440
podcast the national blast

949
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,000
and the next one is really to get into

950
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,480
all

951
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
the bills that are on the floor right

952
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
now that are responding to the executive

953
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,559
order that are responding to things like

954
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,279
the colonial hack and others and make

955
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:13,919
sure

956
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,480
that we're making legislation that makes

957
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,880
sense that we're continuing to build on

958
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,840
a foundation

959
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,880
of hey we tried this before and maybe it

960
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,720
worked and maybe it didn't

961
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,640
a foundation of bringing the right

962
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,000
people from the community

963
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,480
from the private sector from the states

964
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,840
from the military from

965
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,399
all over the world to help understand

966
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,640
what these laws look like and what their

967
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240
second and third order effects are going

968
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,559
to be it's all about

969
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,440
digging in to what we have ahead of us

970
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,279
right now we have the ability

971
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,360
in this community in this community

972
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,559
right here

973
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,320
we have the ability right now to shape

974
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,000
the future of cyber security

975
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,919
and to shape the protection of critical

976
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,760
infrastructure in our country

977
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,559
and so i challenge each of you to learn

978
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,559
more about it learn more about where we

979
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,640
came from here and learn more about what

980
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,519
we can do

981
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,679
to make a difference in the next couple

982
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,559
of months

983
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,159
because that's what it is that's where

984
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,760
we're at

985
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,879
so let's do it make it better

986
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,918
that's all i have i think probably turn

987
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,520
it back over to bryson

988
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,280
and at least for questions

989
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,520
so what's going to be in part two

990
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,679
what's not gonna be in part two so part

991
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,800
two is actually gonna dig

992
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,040
into every single one of the bills

993
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,560
that's on the floor right now and

994
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,679
cross-reference them

995
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,760
from bills and laws that already exist

996
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,239
that cover that or they don't cover that

997
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,239
part two is going to focus more on why

998
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,918
don't we take some of the language out

999
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,599
of a couple of these bills and focus

1000
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,440
them into one that actually makes sense

1001
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:49,918
for

1002
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,599
all of critical infrastructure security

1003
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,000
and not individual slices

1004
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,159
that might you know make sense for one

1005
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,320
senator state or for one

1006
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,320
person's you know specific

1007
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,480
i hate to say lobby group but lobby

1008
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,520
group this

1009
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,359
is a whole of nation picture and we we

1010
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,119
have to start getting better at

1011
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,040
understanding the whole of nation

1012
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,800
laws that we have in place already that

1013
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,240
have executions that

1014
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,200
i'm sorry that have teeth that can be

1015
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,280
executed on but then also

1016
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,520
understanding what we don't need right

1017
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,839
now which is more legislation that has

1018
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,160
no teeth that has no chance of actually

1019
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,000
changing anything

1020
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,839
so that's part two

1021
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,800
so we got chris english in the white

1022
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,520
house

1023
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,960
jen easterly has finally just been

1024
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,000
confirmed as the next cesa director

1025
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,200
i know we're there we're there we have

1026
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,960
the right people at the right place at

1027
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
the right time

1028
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,160
and the right things are happening and

1029
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,839
we have to as a community we have to

1030
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,640
step up and

1031
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,480
we have to make sure that we get it

1032
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,320
right this time right

1033
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,160
because it's time it's time right now

1034
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,000
right now i put it in the

1035
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
i put it in the chat and in the discord

1036
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,640
the ssas are now

1037
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,720
srma sector risk management agencies

1038
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,280
that's the new the new title the new

1039
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,079
buzzword

1040
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,000
yes i didn't get the part that far in my

1041
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
history but

1042
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,839
i still say ssa because it's easier to

1043
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,920
be honest yeah i know and it's what i

1044
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,640
know

1045
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,000
so but yeah if anybody has questions

1046
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,720
about this

1047
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,000
or how you can help um we are

1048

working to put together um some cyber

1049
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,520
security folks

1050
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,400
um not just you know policy people or

1051
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,920
policy wonks but

hackers and ceos and everyday operators

1053

who are doing

1054

you know all of these things so that we

1055

can help

1056
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,839
inform legislation that makes sense not

1057
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,079
just legislation that makes sense for

1058
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,240
companies but that makes sense for those

1059
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,839
of us who are doing the work too

1060

national blast is about to have its own

1106
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,160
website

1107
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,560
it's been a hot minute but that's going

1108
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,760
to be up and we're going to talk about

1109
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,040
some of the things that we're

1110
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
doing at black hat and who we're going

1111
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,560
to be talking to and what we're going to

1112
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,440
try to do with that

1113
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,320
all right it's time to yeah

1114
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,160
super cool so

1115
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,640
questions anything are people like

1116
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,160
asking questions no

1117
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,119
uh but we did have some comparisons to

1118
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:25,680
um

1119
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,400
uh because uh johnny's from brazil so he

1120
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,720
was

1121
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,119
uh commenting on how different it was to

1122
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,800
hear the insights here versus

1123
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,599
what he expected um and the difference

1124
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,400
between state

1125
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,599
and federal government

1126
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,240
and noting the usage of cyber criminals

1127
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,839
instead of hackers which was

1128
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,599
lovely to see it's very lovely to see

1129
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,160
definitely and that's a whole other soap

1130
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,680
box that i can get on in terms of

1131
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,640
legislation

1132
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,680
um you can check out my podcast i've

1133
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,440
already had at least three

1134
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,920
episodes dedicated to that and and how

1135
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,119
we need to do better

1136
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,640
for our our non-cyber criminals our

1137
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,760
hackers who are

1138
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,359
out there every day you know finding

1139
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,960
great information and reporting it and

1140
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,440
then

1141
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,520
maybe not being taken care of as well as

1142
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,079
they should be

1143
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,520
yep legislation media representation

1144
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
the whole nine just need to kind of all

1145
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,960
over all

1146
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,319
that whole yes

1147
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,720
especially you know um one of the things

1148
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,319
that i'm watching very closely is this

1149
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,040
whole

1150
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,280
breach verification piece that senator

1151
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,880
warner and some others are working on

1152
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,920
i think that when it comes to defending

1153
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,720
the um hacker the security researcher

1154
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,160
the individuals who are out there doing

1155
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,920
that i think breach verification is

1156
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,839
exactly where that conversation needs to

1157
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:46,480
happen

1158
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,599
since these are the people who are

1159
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,119
bringing the breach forward and they're

1160
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,800
also the people who are most likely to

1161
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,280
get

1162
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,359
you know kind of screwed by the

1163
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,680
companies who simply don't want to admit

1164
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,079
it

1165
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,280
right they don't want to admit that

1166
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,119
they've had a breach they don't want

1167
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,119
people to know that that's happened so

1168
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,560
they're going to do pretty much anything

1169
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,119
that they can to make it go away

1170
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,560
so i think that that's where we need to

1171
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,760
start having these conversations

1172
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:21,839
yeah absolutely

1173
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,480
you
