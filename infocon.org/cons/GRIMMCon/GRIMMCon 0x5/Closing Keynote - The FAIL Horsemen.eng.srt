1
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,400
the rest of it set it on fire

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,960
i hate i i don't like it when they

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,760
advance

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,560
the plot with just singing like music is

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,480
kind of about like i need you to advance

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,240
the plot with words and if you just do

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,000
it with singing or some sort of

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,599
i just couldn't get completely lost and

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,360
i realized like a half hour later like

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,559
i don't know i don't know what's going

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,120
on i have no idea and i i can't

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,960
and i didn't i didn't think the whole

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
whatever the heck that thing was

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,480
that said there was some really cool

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,480
aspects the king though is phenomenal

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,000
it's quite literally the only show tune

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,440
i've ever listened to in my guard by

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:47,920
myself

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,879
my choice the king's part is that is

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,000
awesome

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
they're hilarious the three they're

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,239
hilarious yes

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,399
absolutely i'm just realizing how not

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,680
cultured i am

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,680
uh so i i'm taking it in

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,000
all right me too chris i don't know if

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
that's true

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,159
everybody okay

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,960

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,320
inputs a little you're a little quiet

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,680

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,119

i'm okay give me just that never mind

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,560
no matt sounds like liquid gold

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,080
it's the hair like always it's like

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759
samsung you cut it off and it just turns

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,119
stretchy

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,920
um i cut my hair off i think i'm doing

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,240
all right

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
yeah i'm gonna slowly just like dial it

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,439
back

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,360
yeah you don't want to do it all no it's

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,560
so cool when you go in and

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
it's like the whole thing just goes

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
did you guys quit rubbing that in i mean

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,280
stop

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,520
oh yeah

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
you barely go get the other angles

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,520
oh all right thanks thanks for showing

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
us we get the back too

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,880
you got it thank you that's probably a

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,079
good segue for

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,640
the the title of our keto panel which is

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,239
the failed horseman

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,599
um and so tim with red siege

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,879
chris with 40 north and matt with open

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,760
security

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
and then of course me with grim each one

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,599
of us has created

61
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,640
founded and runs um a

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,000
an offensive security consulting company

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and we have had many trials and

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
tribulations starting with

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,959
huge [ __ ] ups and mistakes right and

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,680
what's cool

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,760
is we talk about it all the time and so

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,840
i thought it'd be fun for us to

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
share a lot of these experiences with

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,959
the crowd that we've had

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
um and so tim since you physically show

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
the most like pain with the loss of hair

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,640
and the gray

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,680
we're gonna let you you you kick it off

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,080
yeah we had um i mean i mean i'm in a

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
hotel i'm actually teaching this week so

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,800
i've

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,640
cordoned myself on my classroom after

79
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
finishing

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,360
on time a little bit early we're okay

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
so if you hear other stuff it's rainbow

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,040
hotel people anyway

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,879
um i think one of the biggest ones early

84
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,120
on is is trying to nail down some of the

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
agreements like you're like

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
i don't know what i'm doing here i have

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,200
no clue what i don't know what i

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,480
remember the first one that really bit

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,760
me in the butt we're like

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,440
all right get the contract i'll sign

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,680
like you know still early on

92
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
still super excited about every single

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,959
contract that's being signed

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,319
and we get to the kickoff call and

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,319
they're like by the way we need off our

96
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,760
testing

97
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,080
we're like yeah but you know the

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,200
contract's already signed i'm like yeah

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,480
but we need to change that like

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,959
contract's already signed and you know i

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,879
i don't have the capability to say you

102
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,319
know we're not doing the gig anymore

103
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,599
they're like oh great now

104
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,080
we're doing this we're going to stay up

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,040
all night for

106
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,159
multiple weeks and uh and then work and

107
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,840
that brings a little bit of pain

108
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
so yeah there's there's number one for

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,040
tim

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,720
so it gets to a point where like you

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,799
just don't have to work off hours

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,680
anyways because

113
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
i think we're still there we still do it

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
just to make people happy

115
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,920
it seems like we we do so now now in the

116
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,640
contract

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
if you want off hours we charge you

118
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,239
extra so

119
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,519
we've had three ever take us up on that

120
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,879
and we try to bring the pain we're like

121
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,920
look you want it off all right it's

122
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,959
gonna be 25

123
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,639
and every once in a while like fine done

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,720
you're like oh yeah

125
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,918
damn that's exactly what we do i don't

126
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,479
know like infosec is so

127
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,720
so prone to burnout to begin with and i

128
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
mean like if you're gonna make your team

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,639
do off-hour testing you're already if

130
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,000
you're an infosec you're already burning

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,520
out right are you really gonna do that

132
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
so yeah we do the exact same thing so

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
we're gonna make it as painful for you

134
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,880
to require us to test off ours as

135
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
possible so that

136
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,639
you know we're to share the burden here

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,360
yeah we

138
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
i mean one thing we try to do to unfail

139
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,800
that is like look

140
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
we'll we'll we'll give some of the much

141
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
the money to the consultant so it's

142
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
it sucks but it ideally sucks a little

143
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
bit less when they can

144
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,320
know buy fishing poles or whatever the

145
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
hell i don't know i always get my

146
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,799
face off

147
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,560
so yeah no yeah well first of all i

148
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,759
think we're lucky that none of us work

149
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,000
in

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,280
ir because he's talking about burnout ir

151
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,600
burns you out faster right we're talking

152
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
like

153
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
one to two years of life expectancy

154
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
because of that challenge

155
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
and that was something we did actually

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,919
said we're not gonna do ir because

157
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,919
uh the management challenge and that

158
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,840
burnout piece i did i didn't see how i

159
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,360
could do that to our people

160
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,479
um so back back to you chris what was uh

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,758
what was one of your big fails

162
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
um i think especially when we were first

163
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
really starting we were

164
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,199
trying to figure out like how do we do

165
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,800
marketing like how do we do

166
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,919
like get leads and get work and um

167
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,360
like still to the day that that's a

168
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,919
mystery i i would say i mean we do

169
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
we do a lot of um like blog posts and

170
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,600
stuff we're like mean we need to get out

171
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,360
there and like pay for something

172
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,759
and one of the first things that we uh

173
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
got suckered into was

174
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,880
hey uh we have this like big luncheon

175
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,520
conference thing full of like cisos just

176
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,479
for you to talk to

177
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,199
all day it's a 10k buy-in and you can go

178
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
there for like lunch and talk to people

179
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
and stuff we're like or it's like more

180
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,639
breakfast and lunch we're like you know

181
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,479
what

182
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,080
we'll try something different see how it

183
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
works um

184
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
worst decision like that we've ever made

185
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,199
like we went there we talked with people

186
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,680
like z

187
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,639
like literally nothing came out of it um

188
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,400
it was basically a bunch of people that

189
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
wanted to go for a free lunch

190
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
which who wouldn't want to go for free

191
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,280
lunch and breakfast and kind of just get

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
out of the office and we

193
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,400
spent yeah that was probably about 10

194
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
little more than 10 grand just to get in

195
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,600
travel all of that and um had

196
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,160
absolutely nothing come from it and we

197
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
still get hit up by the

198
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
the same organization you're like hey

199
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,800
you guys want to come back and sponsor

200
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680
this again we're like

201
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,479
absolutely not like please take us off

202
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,120
your list

203
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,440
it's just it was it was a bad choice for

204
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
us when we were first starting it was uh

205
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,080
an expensive hit today if i can add to

206
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
yours we did something similar so

207
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,039
if you've got a business one of the

208
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,160
things you'll do is you'll get hit from

209
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,759
these magazines and they're like

210
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,880
hey you've been selected for it

211
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
you all know it's it's it's malarkey

212
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,680
right but you're like you know it's

213
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,960
getting out there and then

214
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,319
you tell them no and then they cut the

215
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,960
price backs we're like all right

216
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,360
and we tried it twice one of them

217
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,000
actually wasn't

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
terrible because they actually keep

219
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,199
retweeting stuff for us

220
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,800
and they got a decent following the

221
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
other one was completely wasted and

222
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,599
we're

223
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,840
we're done with that now no no hardbacks

224
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,520
i swear it's like once a week i'll get

225
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,800
something like that fifteen hundred

226
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,919
dollars for your

227
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,360
like promotion or possible inclusion and

228
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,639
it makes me feel like every time i see

229
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,160
bryson tweet something with like all the

230
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
sales people

231
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,599
like all the random sales messages that

232
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,560
he gets

233
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,199
i was like oh my gosh it never ends does

234
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,599
it

235
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,960
like it never ends that's 80 of my email

236
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
at least

237
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
oh yeah a good junk mail filter has been

238
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,520
slowly starting to go

239
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,319
been worth the effort yeah we started

240
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,199
adding i took this

241
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
i took this cue from dave kennedy is we

242
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,080
have an exchange mail rule

243
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,560
that if you you you get two tries you

244
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,400
mess up once

245
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,639
we keep track the second time you go in

246
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,440
a list

247
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,240
and it it automatically rejects and and

248
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
says some inappropriate things in

249
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
response about spammers

250
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
actually very appropriate because they

251
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
deserve it so they get a hard their

252
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,479
entire organization immediately blocked

253
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,840
ironically i had one of those like talk

254
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,479
to a bunch of csos marketing emails come

255
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,520
in today

256
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,599
uh where they sent me the email and they

257
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,039
sent me that same email again

258
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,399
within two minutes so it would have

259
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,839
immediately broken your filter there you

260
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,719
go

261
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,839
yeah so matt what's your what's your big

262
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,159
uh

263
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,240

both chris and uh tim and so

267
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,120
one of my biggest fails maybe the

268
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
biggest in fact was a red team i was

269
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,920
doing with chris

270
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760

casino you're like oh yeah burst that

275
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,000
dirt off my shoulder

276
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
this is what i'm doing red team for this

277
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,920
is what i always wanted

278
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,640
um and so so i'm i'm lead on it and and

279
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,040
uh

280
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,880
i'm working with chris and uh we've got

281
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,320
a web app and they also have the casino

282
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,279
that we're going after

283
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,480
and i'm supposed to be doing the web at

284
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
first then we're gonna do a lot of the

285
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,640
red teaming together but they're running

286
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
a little bit parallel

287
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,480
but it started off a little funky so we

288
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,279
got this this

289
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,640
this email in from uh their ciso to get

290
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
this all sorted

291
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
and to get it started right and we go to

292
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,800
scheduling all that stuff but he was

293
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,680
emailing us from

294
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,240
a gmail okay a little bit red flags here

295
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,200
already right

296
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
but of course you gotta you gotta verify

297
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,000
exactly who that is we're on the phone

298
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,279
with him we talked to him yes it was in

299
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,800
fact the exact person that we thought it

300
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,279
was

301
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,560
it was the right person it wasn't just

302
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
some random person hiring us to do a red

303
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,440
team

304
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
for a casino illegally now this was

305
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,279
actually the cso

306
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,959
uh and the reason why it's wanted to uh

307
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,480
to communicate with us on this

308
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,800
uh uh this gmail was because he said hi

309
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,839
the the security team

310
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,680
they are watching uh the email the whole

311
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,000
time and i wanna make sure this is a not

312
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,959
announced test

313
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,800
because i want to test them uh without

314
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,160
them knowing okay that

315
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,079
i buy it makes sense as we start doing

316
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
this test and we scheduled this red team

317
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,720
for

318
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
i don't know three or six weeks it was

319
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,040
actually scheduled i think it was six

320
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,240
weeks it's actually scheduled for a

321
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,920
pretty darn long red team

322
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,959
and so this this sisa was really

323
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,240
really really needy so like uh i'm on

324
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,279
the phone with him

325
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,320
like weeks before the test on an almost

326
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,600
daily basis because he's got

327
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
he's got to like get this thing right

328
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
anyone's check this box off and he wants

329
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
to see if we're going to do that

330
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,959
and so on and so on we're being nice

331
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,959
about it but like literally by the time

332
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,640
we hit the test i'm already like 40

333
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
hours invested in this engagement like

334
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,959
wow

335
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,079
please stop now please

336
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,279
and so we start the test and on test day

337
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,079
of course he's

338
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,320
really really verbose with me again uh

339
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,000
the whole time so i'm not i'm literally

340
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,600
not getting to test whatsoever

341
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,959
i'm talking with chris a little bit and

342

344
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,519
and within like two hours and i've

345
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,959
basically been on the phone with a guy

346
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,160
the entire time over this two-hour

347
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,519
period within two hours

348
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
chris domain admin on the uh

349
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,480
the casino the whole thing's gone just

350
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,079
like got it okay

351
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,200
hey do you want to start dialing up the

352
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
noise like oh wow you're already

353
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,720
you're already there huh oh okay um let

354
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,399
me get back to you real quick

355
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,320
he does some stuff i maybe like throw a

356
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,519
packet or two at the web app at this

357
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,079
point

358
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,600
um he comes back he's like okay yeah go

359
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
ahead and dial up some noise now we do

360
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,959
and eventually the blue team they catch

361
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,800
on to something so we just we're styling

362
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,839
up as much as we can i just start

363
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,680
dropping metasploits in random places

364
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,760
to get them to look they find it chris

365
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,120
is in the email right he's in their

366
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
email he's watching their ir

367
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,399
happen their their their incident hand

368
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,160
is like oh yeah they see it they fix it

369
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,680
they think it's completely eradicated

370
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
it's like oh yeah we're ready to move on

371
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
we just like face palm the whole time ah

372
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,560
no so first failure

373
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,880
casino second failure here gets here's

374
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,240
where it gets crazy

375
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,279
turns out next day comes around and

376
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,680
uh the the the csos like starting to

377
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,480
swept bullets

378
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,000
and you can hear a lot of like nervous

379
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
tension in his voice and over the course

380
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,160
the next couple days we realize

381
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,680
that this test is not only not announced

382
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
to the blue team it's not announced to

383
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,760
anybody in management of the casino

384
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
at all and he was specifically told not

385
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,040
to do

386
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,959
a third party test at all either so

387
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,040
for a couple days into this six week

388
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
test and we're like we are out

389
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,079
we're done completely done um but also

390
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,200
i've been communicating this guy the

391
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
whole time i've barely gotten to do any

392
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,040
testing whatsoever chris gets to do all

393
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,800
the fun red team stuff hack casino

394
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,839
and i'm sitting here playing with his

395
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,600
web app but i barely got to touch the

396
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,160
web app

397
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,920
so i'm like still the very beginning of

398
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,200
the scanning piece because i've gotten

399
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
to do nothing except talk with him and

400
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,680
now it's like okay we're just gonna

401
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,800
deliver a report with what we've gotten

402
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,200
like

403
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,959
i'm gonna do a web app pen test report

404
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,440
with a nicto scan i don't know

405
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,920
i found nothing because it spent no time

406
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,120
on it so i'm like ah

407
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
and it was absolutely the most garbage

408
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,040
report i've a ever made

409
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
was embarrassed work so i could spend

410
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,839
the rest of like the report time that i

411
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,399
could do

412
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,160
just doing as much ocean against the web

413
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,680
app as i possibly could because we're

414
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,120
like we're not touching any of your

415
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,760
stuff

416
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,959
ever again also fired the customer

417
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,399
awesome so yeah fails all around there

418
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,560
except for chris he owns the entire

419
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,399
now that's that's a rough i mean that's

420
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,240
a scary one right like you you think

421
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,680
you're operating legitimately like you

422
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
got the documentation

423
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
i mean legally you should be more than

424
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,040
covered but like

425
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,720
you don't know just the threat of a

426
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,639
lawsuit just i mean you got to go to

427
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,839
court regardless you're probably going

428
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,600
to win but now you're still in court

429
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,320
like that that's a scary situation like

430
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,880
i don't

431
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
want to be in like that yeah absolutely

432
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
that's the worst nightmare style

433
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,320
i mean it's all about negligence right

434
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
so if you can because it's gonna be a

435
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,880
civil case so it's proponents of the

436
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,480
evidence which means if you can show

437
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,920
uh that you have done due diligence

438
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
which we absolutely did right we

439
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,639
there was this gmail thing that was a

440
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,760
little weird that was definitely a red

441
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
flag uh but then we identified exactly

442
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,040
who this person was it was the right

443
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,399
person they were the ciso

444
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,160
uh we had every reason to believe that

445
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,519
what we were doing was completely above

446
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,000
board which

447
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,760
was just not on the cso side

448
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,639
so yeah we wouldn't have lost but that's

449
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,399
still that's not a fight that you want

450
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:00,880
to even

451
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,720
have to have on the bright side the

452
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,399
casino completely blamed the cso which

453
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,760
i think that's probably a good call on

454
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,279
their part and it didn't actually turn

455
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,959
out poorly it was just uh

456
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,680
wow wow yeah so yeah

457
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,040
oh

458
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,199
yeah the derivative of that one um where

459
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,519
uh it's not quite the same whereas like

460
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,120
the so it was for a large auto

461
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,560
manufacturer and we had

462
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,399
of course we had we had legal approval

463
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,680
which took forever

464
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,920
for that and the there's an entire car

465
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,880
and scope

466
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,320
um but what was what the challenge is

467
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,760
is i think there were probably about 15

468
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,519
to 20 different product teams

469
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,959
that were a part of the scope of the

470
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,560
assessment and they all didn't

471
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,000
necessarily agree with this idea

472
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,959
of having a third party do this and so

473
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,839
we had

474
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,760
um you know we had the leak we were we

475
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,880
were there was no question of the

476
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,560
legality of what we were doing

477
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,440
but the the test was a constant fight

478
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,079
for

479
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,560
documentation and detail because of

480
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,519
course you know

481
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,360
you only have so much time to do that

482
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,440
kind of test and the more you have to

483
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
spend reverse engineering and going and

484
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,639
figuring things out

485
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,199
the you know the more expensive the

486
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,639
longer it has and the more likely your

487
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,480
project is to fail

488
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,000
i think the funny cap on that one is

489
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,399
we ended up finding um and it became a

490
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,760
finding in our report but it was

491
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,199
technically out of scope

492
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,760
was because of the challenges we had

493
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,720
working with the

494
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,519
different teams we went out and found a

495
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,000
russian

496
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,720
file server with all of their like

497
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,079
proprietary

498
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,959
files so it we ended up like finding the

499
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,399
stuff that really helped us do our job

500
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,839
because they didn't give it to us

501
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,160
but it was some random russian server

502
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
where it was

503
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,120
oh my god

504
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
wow

505
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
you guys ever have a customer give you

506
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
like out of scope ip ranges

507
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,480
all the time yep test test our partners

508
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,839
not on purpose

509
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,800
yeah but not on purpose

510
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,240
really yeah i i haven't either it's

511
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,120
always

512
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,560
scary though we're starting kicking off

513
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
our initial stuff thank god like it's

514
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,959
never hit

515
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,040
the exploitation or like any phase like

516
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,480
that it's usually when we're

517
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,240
doing scans like looking at what's going

518
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
on and then we're realizing this this

519
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,800
doesn't look

520
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,079
right and we have to very quickly try to

521
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,839
call them just to see like what

522
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
do you do you own this are you sure you

523
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,120
do and then it's like oh

524
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,199
i there was like a slash that should

525
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,360
have been like a slash 24 instead of 22

526
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,000
something like that and it's uh been

527
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
interesting

528
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,959
yeah we had one that they were trying to

529
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,040
onboard a vendor and they uh had some

530
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,240
they were doing like their internal

531
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,839
review on the security of this

532
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,880
organization right all the

533
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,800
questionnaires data center crap right

534
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
all that junk

535
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
and they're like yeah we need to test

536
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,680
this vendor and we started talking and i

537
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,000
started

538
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
picking up like this something seems off

539
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,120
and i'm like and asked the question like

540
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,759
do you have authorization like yeah

541
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,199
okay and at the surface level i mean

542
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,519
i mean why would you not think that they

543
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,319
would

544
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,839
but eventually it's like this this is a

545
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,280
vendor and we're testing them like do

546
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,760
you have

547
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,919
approval in paperwork let me get more

548
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,359
and more and more specific and

549
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,319
eventually they're like

550
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,119
well no we don't have that oh my god

551
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,760
like

552
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,679
this is not gonna i wanna get shell on

553
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,039
this thing and we're gonna get arrested

554
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,240
like

555
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,640
terrible

556
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,000
i got i got two two ones in two

557
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,240
different directions um international

558
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,840
right so the first is um canada while it

559
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,039
is our friendly

560
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,440
neighbor to the north trying to do work

561
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,480
in canada

562
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
is actually really really really really

563
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,480
really really hard to do

564
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,640
um and you know it takes all these hoops

565
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,799
because you have to justify that

566
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,960
there is nobody there that can do it to

567
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,039
get it but that wasn't what got us

568
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,760
um we actually had somebody on the on

569
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,160
the

570
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,880
flight there got stopped by customs and

571
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,320
during interrogation

572
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,679
they realized that they were going there

573
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,720
for work you know we had a we had a gig

574
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,840
and so it was uh

575
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
we we were given the riot act of like

576
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,360
don't you ever dare do this again like

577
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,480
we'll stop you

578
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,679
um and so we learned that one um

579
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,080
the second one was what's your flag

580
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,760
because they'll flag your account you're

581
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,480
the flag your

582
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,559
profile and every time now you get that

583
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,600
extra round yeah

584
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,720
i i i now have that sir

585
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,440
come to this line

586
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,840
well i mean you're naturally invited

587
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,320
so the the second one was trying to hire

588
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,799
um somebody in the european union

589
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,200
um and it's the same kind of thing like

590
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,799
once you start looking at like

591
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,880
we we we had negotiated we had gone

592
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,960
through things and we didn't realize

593
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,520
that the the terms of trying to work

594
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,039
with that country

595
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,240
and then the uh a you know a citizen of

596
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
the european union

597
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,960
and it killed the whole thing because we

598
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
were just like uh as far as we can tell

599
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,440
even if we tried to 1099 you this is

600
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,640
going to take us like two to three

601
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,919
months of like dedicated legal effort

602
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
oh and we had to rescind which which was

603
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,720
sucked yeah

604
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,840
hiring people is is hard we i remember

605
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,280
we were looking to do

606
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,640
um we were looking to bring on an intern

607
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
at the time and um uh we had like a

608
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,440
kind of like a test just like a base

609
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,039
just to see where people are um like

610
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,400
what you can do like what skill set do

611
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,679
you have it's like super minimal

612
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,120
probably took like an hour maybe your

613
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,160
time just so

614
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,520
we could see what people doing and um uh

615
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
had a bunch of people request for it and

616
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
so we had only a couple

617
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,440
like responses back and um i remember

618
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
one person i thought like did

619
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,120
actually a pretty decent job and so we

620
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,039
ended up talking with them

621
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,640
and i get on the phone and or they they

622
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,760
give me a call back

623
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,799
and they're like hey i'm so-and-so um i

624
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,760
just want to let you know

625
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
first of all that um i cheated on your

626
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,039
text

627
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,280
and like what how do you cheat on that i

628
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,080
was like okay

629
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,799
they're like i had my my friend do the

630
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,840
whole thing

631
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,080
um i actually didn't like do it at all

632
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,120
and i was like

633
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
okay this this conversation's starting

634
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,159
great

635
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,080
and this i was basically on the phone

636
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,440
for like 30 minutes

637
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,799
uh with this because i didn't want to be

638
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,080
like rude and just cut them off or

639
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,200
anything but there's

640
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,720
especially them telling me

641
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,360
yeah they had their friend do the test

642
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
and uh they didn't understand it but

643
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,919
they still

644
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,720
wanted me to bring them on board that's

645
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,679
like i

646
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,600
i appreciate the effort and i applaud

647
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
you but like i've never had someone

648
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,960
either before then

649
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,520
in my career or since then ever tell me

650
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,159
that they

651
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,159
just outright didn't do the test gave it

652
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,200
to someone else

653
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
and still thought that they were like

654
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,640
they should be hired there and brought

655
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,600
on so

656
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,480
it was a it was a weird weird scenario

657
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
i've just not had that before

658
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,919
i've had so for uh for hiring we always

659
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,640
ask for a writing sample and i'm

660
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,159
a little bit vague like hey i want to

661
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,280
see what does it look like when you

662
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
write a report and then kind of vague

663
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,919
something i want to see what do they

664
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,120
think

665
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
um three times in my career i had

666
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,039
somebody

667
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,720
send me an internal pen test report

668
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,280
from their company and they attempted to

669
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,400
redact it

670
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,559
redaction is exceptionally hard

671
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,080
and in all three cases i'm like cool

672
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,720
i can see this company name and you gave

673
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,080
me a hack by numbers

674
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
you have violated your company's nda you

675
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,120
violated their nda

676
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,520
literally the phone call i'm much more

677
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,400
direct than chris

678
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,760
i was like look here's the deal you will

679
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,600
never work here because you will

680
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
you're gonna you're gonna take a client

681
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
data and just share it with random

682
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,080
people whatever the hell you feel like

683
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,480
that

684
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,720
but it was literally a hack by numbers

685
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
and one of them had like really really

686
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,480
bad redaction and they rejected they did

687
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,000
a search and replaced but all of the

688
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
image had the company names and domain

689
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,600
names there were passwords in there

690
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,439
that probably still were it was like

691
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,720
this isn't even a teaching moment you're

692
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
applying for a senior position like

693
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,080
you're done for all time like

694
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,000
and like i said three times i've seen

695
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,440
this it's uh by the way

696
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,760
people listening don't do that don't

697
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,120
don't don't

698
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,799
no don't you've seen something like that

699
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,480
before your internal

700
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
private work uh through yourself

701
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
yeah one of the bright sides about being

702
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,760
a smaller company is that i don't

703
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,880
i've never hired someone who i haven't

704
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
known personally um

705
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,280
for at least a little while so you get

706
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,120
to you get to miss out on a lot of those

707
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
fails

708
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,159
um but that doesn't scale

709
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,240
um i have seen something similar to that

710
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
report though where i've done i've done

711
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
a pen test for organization

712
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,520
and um they provision like an internal

713
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,120
system to do an internal pen test such

714
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,320
as a windows device with some stuff on

715
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,919
it and they let you access it

716
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,600
and so i i log into this windows device

717
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,720
right and i'm looking at the desktop

718
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,440
there's a bunch of things where they

719
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,280
install i see like nmaps there so the

720
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,880
zenmap logos over there i'm like oh they

721
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,000
can figure this device for me that's

722
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,039
really nice of them

723
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,799
and i open up the my documents folder

724
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,080
right

725
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,039
what do i see it's last year's pen test

726
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,320
report

727
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,440
no no ah

728
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,880
and guess what so i open up the pen test

729
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,000
report like okay let's see what they did

730
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
let's see it worked last year

731
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,679
and the pen tester got domain admin and

732
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,039
they didn't redact anything in the

733
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,880
report at all so to be fair i'd never

734
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,280
put a

735
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
pen test report out there where the

736
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,919
domain admin password is in plain text

737
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,919
in the pen test report that's

738
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,000
don't do that and so because i mean the

739
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,360
idea of course is

740
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,280
if you find the domain admin password

741
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
that should probably get changed right

742
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
so you might think oh i can put it in

743
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,520
the pen test report

744
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,799
because they're going to change that

745
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,799
right guess what

746
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
no it's the first thing i try on this

747
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
pen test is i just like okay

748
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,440
see if it still works yeah it worked it

749
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,840
worked

750
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,919
just fine that's the shortest path to

751
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,520
domain admin i've ever had

752
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,159
we had one where i enumerated users and

753
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,919
it was another pen test company and i

754
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,360
saw an account and it was it

755
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
enumerated the domain admins and it was

756
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,400
a pen test company

757
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
that i we're all probably quite familiar

758
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,440
with

759
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,600
that was in that group and i'm like i'm

760
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,039
going to guess that the password is the

761
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,400
same as username and it worked

762
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,640
you know it's like no i had to write

763
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,320
this up and i'm like

764
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,880
found this account for a different

765
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
organization and the password was the

766
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,410
same

767
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,120
[Laughter]

768
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,279
it was uh it was uncomfortable but i

769
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,720
laughed it was not that uncomfortable i

770
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,120
just

771
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,159
pretended it kind of was did they did

772
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,000
they appreciate the the

773
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,559
like stupidity of that like we should

774
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,679
never hire them again kind of thing

775
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,360
i mean i don't know whose stupidity is

776
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,880
worse right because you they

777
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,120
i presume they put this in last year's

778
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,799
report that we got domain admin

779
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,320
and you should clean up this account and

780
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,480
they clearly never

781
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,039
i mean i i there's layers i don't know

782
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,480
it's like an onion that was dunked in

783
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:38,880
poop

784
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,440
i don't know before that's a really

785
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,200
common thing that i will see actually uh

786
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,640
like all the time not necessarily the

787
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,159
passwords the same as a username but

788
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:46,880
where there's a

789
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,039
pen test company that i can recognize

790
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,559
and there's an account that is in active

791
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,279
directory

792
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,960
from that company it's probably that

793
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,799
organization like the the organization

794
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,000
that you're testing not the pen test

795
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,480
company

796
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,960
who made that account and in the scope

797
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,240
of work and the rules of engagement

798
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,360
there's probably a bunch of things that

799
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,640
say okay you need to take unity

800
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,000
provision all of these things after the

801
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,880
pen test

802
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
um so we can go back to you know

803
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,240
standard or whatever it is

804
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,159
uh but as the pentas firm honestly you

805
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,600
should never trust the customer to do

806
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,840
the right thing

807
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,120
ever on the other hand though it's also

808
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,000
a little bit tough because what if

809
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,840
you're going back in to do remediation

810
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
uh validation right so you maybe don't

811
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,200
want to get rid of the count and

812
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,080
de-provision them

813
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,840
until after that phase happens but what

814
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,200
if they never actually bring you back in

815
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
to do that because they didn't actually

816
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,799
follow through on the whole scope now

817
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,919
you've got all of these little things

818
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,440
going around but as a result i end up

819
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,080
seeing that all the time

820
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,880
we ship a vm for remote testing we have

821
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,279
a client from two years ago their vm is

822
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,799
still trying to check back into our

823
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,360
infrastructure

824
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,080
two years two years like why what is

825
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,600
this ip like oh right that's

826
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,919
i assume you've tried to inform them

827
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,760
we've we're we've done other we we're

828
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,360
doing another test we finished it like a

829
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,960
month ago we're like hey by the way

830
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,559
can you can you de-provision this other

831
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,440
box like oh yeah we're on top of that

832
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
they are not said that kind of thing a

833
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,760
couple times in a little like a sideline

834
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,320
manner uh where i've identified a like a

835
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,880
sans

836
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,640
vm from like a sans class in an

837
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,919
enterprise environment

838
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,240
and as an instructor i know the default

839
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,320
passwords though so just log straight in

840
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,760
um i've seen that more than once i've

841
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,840
seen that more than once

842
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,360
it's like oh your password and username

843
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,320
are sec 560. huh

844
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,520
well since we're complaining about

845
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
clients now and client fails

846
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,600
um we've all had the we've all had the

847
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,120
experience right of the the client who

848
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,480
shows up and is like i want a

849
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,000
penetration test you're always of course

850
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,480
like

851
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,840
what does that mean to you what do you

852
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
what do you think you're asking for

853
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,679
right

854
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,200
like let's let's get on the same

855
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,880
definition of vocabulary

856
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
um and the price range usually dictates

857
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,960
that answer as well

858
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,000
you know uh well like this this should

859
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,840
be five thousand dollars

860
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,279
what do you think we can do for five

861
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,200
thousand dollars right like this is the

862
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,080
you want me to

863
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,919
just give you a nessus report like you

864
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,120
can't run your own like

865
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,320
what do you want um and uh

866
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,600
that so that that like that delta of

867
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,520
definition where you know of course

868
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,120
fixing up what a pen test is

869
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
what the scope is what's a red team

870
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,480
versus what a pen test is in a

871
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,000
vulnerability assessment

872
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,679
why something costs what it costs and

873
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,600
the expense the time that it takes to do

874
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,240
that

875
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,440
um and um of course going back to my

876
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
my other automotive manufacturer example

877
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,320
but um that same problem again where

878
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,960
they they delay they delay they delay

879
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,000
and they're like hey can you do this

880
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,679
tomorrow and you're like still wait for

881
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,679
the documentation because we haven't

882
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,919
confirmed scope from a bill bill to do

883
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,640
this properly

884
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,080
i've had a happen a couple times in my

885
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,679
career i can't remember the most recent

886
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,080
time

887
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
but um we're setting up like

888
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,120
infrastructure where we're doing penta

889
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,720
uh it was a pen test against an

890
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,640
organization and um get through the

891
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,919
assessment like we've got

892
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,840
c2 outbound and everything and we've

893
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,039
been able to do the test

894
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,960
and everything went well it was over

895
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,720
with and so we go through and clean up

896
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,279
and

897
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,159
we have documentation that we use

898
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,760
internally which i'm sure everyone does

899
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,840
that uh we check say okay where do we

900
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,159
have like access to what modifications

901
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,520
we make to systems

902
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
um and make sure that we basically

903
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
revert everything back to the original

904
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,320
state

905
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
um so we go through all of that check

906
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,520
everything off and

907
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
call it a day at the end of the test and

908
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,919
it'd be like two weeks later

909
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,799
oh this happened multiple times uh that

910
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,240
customer would be like hey

911
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,600
are you guys still active in our

912
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,520
environment right

913
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,080
no and uh they're like well we're we're

914
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,720
seeing

915
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,039
systems beaconing out to where you're

916
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,720
using for c2 and i was like

917
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,480
there's there's no way and so we'll go

918
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,080
and check and um

919
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,640
sure enough we had like active sessions

920
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,320
inside their environment like

921
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,679
what is going on like how did that

922
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,080
happen we had no idea

923
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,200
and um kill access and uh

924
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
basically two weeks later uh same exact

925
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,399
phone call again

926
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,840
and they're like why are you guys still

927
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,320
inside our environment and we

928
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,760
we're like we just went through this

929
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,520
last week like i don't know what to tell

930
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:07,919
you

931
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,159
and uh since then we've learned to tell

932
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,279
them to check for this

933
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,240
and they're like okay we're gonna do

934
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,480
some investigation on our side and uh in

935
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
the middle of the assessment

936
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,640
this customer had taken a backup a live

937
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,399
backup of multiple systems

938
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,720
when we had access to their systems and

939
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,440
so about

940
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
every two weeks they were rolling back

941
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,200
to that snapshot

942
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,039
and we would get sessions coming back in

943
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,240
in our systems

944
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
and um it was it was interesting because

945
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,919
ever since it happened the first time

946
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,600
we've learned okay we know we cleaned

947
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,440
off i mean that's not necessarily like a

948
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,919
client

949
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,480
fail either that just happened to be bad

950
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,600
timing but it

951
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
it was a a funny situation where we're

952
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,919
like we're really bad at our job if we

953
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,120
can't figure out like

954
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
why we can't get you to stop calling

955
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,039
back to us it was a

956
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,120
it was a unique one

957
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,200
yeah i've seen a bunch of very fairly

958
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,360
similar like backup problems happen

959
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,919
uh where in this case was just they had

960
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,919
it they had a cycle to refer to snapshot

961
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:04,960
on something all the time

962
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,880
but it kept reverting their patches off

963
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
um there's like a couple fails that were

964
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,520
happening at the same time here so this

965
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,320
this organization

966
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,840
like their domain admin had had their

967
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,640
password found by the pen tester

968
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,320
uh three years running and so they were

969
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,760
really really like antsy about i'm not

970
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,799
gonna get caught this year i'm not gonna

971
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,760
get caught this year

972
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,600
and so i find a system and this is this

973
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,440
is like last year so this is actually

974
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,399
fairly recent

975
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,320
and um it's it's vulnerable to eternal

976
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
blue and i'm like what oh come on easy

977
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,799
peasy

978
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,679
so we just get we get in and uh we were

979
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,279
able to mimi cats uh credential guard

980
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,159
was disabled

981
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,240
and get the domain admin password and i

982
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,520
i happen to do this

983
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,039
on a friday like it's friday evening and

984
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,720
i'm like ah man i'm not gonna just get

985
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,760
domain admin

986
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,679
and then stop so i continue to just

987
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,039
basically finish the entire pen test

988
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,919
over the weekend

989
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,600
and on monday i realized cause i'm doing

990
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,080
reporting i'm missing a screenshot

991
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,919
so i go back into the environment domain

992
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,679
i have a password doesn't work anymore

993
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,679
huh fortunately they'd reverted the

994
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,200
snapshots off against who's able to get

995
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,080
it back

996
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,159
in the review of the test here's what

997
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,200
actually happened

998
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
that domain administrator the entire

999
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,880
test window because this was a

1000
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,840
crystal box test right so the new

1001
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
testing was going on the entire test

1002
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,080
window

1003
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,159
the only thing he did there is he sat

1004
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,919
there and kept resetting his password

1005
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,039
every 15 minutes

1006
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,519
the entire time so i was really quite

1007
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,080
lucky

1008
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,640
to get in uh and get da on friday

1009
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,159
evening because he went home

1010
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,679
and so i didn't i didn't recognize that

1011
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,200
this was happening at all

1012
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,279
until monday when it didn't work anymore

1013
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,480
uh fortunately there was some

1014
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,919
nasty solarwinds stuff so that was still

1015
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,080
easy to get back to ta but

1016
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,519
um but yeah that was funny it was

1017
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,440
hilarious i had a

1018
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,080

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,039

shreds a foreign country i had a very

1070
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,200
similar physical

1071
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,559
assessment where we uh we were breaking

1072
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,519
into a bank and

1073
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,880
uh so we're in the bank right branch

1074
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,200
office and we uh we get in easy it was

1075
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,039
the front doors you could just um do

1076
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,320
they were they would open movement so we

1077
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,679
just waited

1078
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,679
in uh the co-located areas and then we

1079
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,640
just waved something through the doors

1080
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,360
we got in so

1081
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,320
we're in the bank we're doing all kind

1082
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,519
of stuff we're about to leave because

1083
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,039
we're done and i go to the printer cause

1084
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,000
i'm like okay there's sometimes

1085
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,200
sensitive documentation the printer i'm

1086
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,080
gonna take a couple pictures with the

1087
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,720
report

1088
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,559
um and the first document that's on top

1089
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,360
of the printer is a franchise agreement

1090
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,760
and i go holy crap what franchise

1091
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,200
agreement on the planet

1092
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,840
allows corporate to hire random people

1093
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,279
to break into your office

1094
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,159
and do whatever the heck they want

1095
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,440
there's no franchise agreement on the

1096
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,880
planet that possibly says that

1097
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,399
so i'm like we gotta go let's get out of

1098
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,559
here right now and we leave

1099
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,919
um and the next day i'm starting to

1100
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,039
write up the report and all that kind of

1101
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,320
stuff and i realized i can't find my

1102
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,880
notes

1103
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,320
i'm a little old school and i take all

1104
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
of my notes in uh like like a notebook

1105
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,480
um it's it's because i used to work in a

1106
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,839
skiff with the military so you can't

1107
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,239
really

1108
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,520
you know you gotta write it all down to

1109
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,599
paper or whatnot so i take all my notes

1110
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,399
in a notebook

1111
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,679
and i realize oh gosh cold sweats i left

1112
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,560
my notebook

1113
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,879
with every single step that i did to

1114
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,480
break into this place

1115
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,520
in that place um

1116
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,119
i had to ask them for my notebook back

1117
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,199
very nicely

1118
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,719
they thought that corporate was allowed

1119
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,000
to send us in there so they did give me

1120
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,119
the notebook back

1121
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,719
and i never told them that we were not

1122
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,239
supposed to be in there and we just

1123
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,480
didn't know

1124
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,040
oops so now i've added a question to our

1125
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,760
q a

1126
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,359
when we're setting up a physical test

1127
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,440
that we will always ask do you know

1128
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,199
anything about franchises and does your

1129
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,719
organization do anything related to

1130
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,879
franchises i want to know it all

1131
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,399
um yeah that was an oops

1132
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,800
but unlike tim i didn't get caught so

1133
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,220
there you go

1134
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,720
[Laughter]

1135
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,920
tim you're on youtube yeah since we're

1136
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,280
being recorded i can't say

1137
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,480
too much i had a co-worker do a test and

1138
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,200
the

1139
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,000
the organization was renting the uh the

1140
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,720
place from the uh the government

1141
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,440
didn't disclose that ahead of time and

1142
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:23,839
uh

1143
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,480
had to frantically leave the country and

1144
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,800
will never go back

1145
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,200
it's a great story not right now

1146
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,240
right here it is a really good story

1147
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,960
um i i have i guess a similar one like

1148
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,839
that where i was somewhere

1149
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,800
and um i think we take for granted

1150
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,760
in the united states that like our our

1151
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,119
government stuff like

1152
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,880
things that are classified or treated as

1153
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
classified and they're marked

1154
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,160
and they're only available in certain

1155
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,400
places like that's obvious

1156
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,680
well um this this country this place

1157
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,240
had top secret documents like on

1158
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,720
somebody's random office wall

1159
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,000
and i just like walked up to him i'm

1160
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,760
like look at that but like

1161
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,839
uh what's that and he the guy was like

1162
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,119
oh yeah you shouldn't be seeing that i'm

1163
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,280
like

1164
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,480
that was like it was like it was an

1165
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,560
entire it was an entire sketch of the

1166
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
intelligence organization

1167
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,320
uh which i had nothing to do with so

1168
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,079
we're clear like i i wasn't affiliated

1169
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:26,960
with that it just

1170
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,720
this guy happened to have that in that

1171
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,160
and i had access to it

1172
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,680
and so i was just sitting there i'm like

1173
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,960
this has got to be the worst stop stack

1174
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,520
of all time

1175
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,400
we all so a friend of mine actually i

1176
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,240
think most of you know him um

1177
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,440
i don't know if i i could think it brett

1178
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,280
tell mark mark's name

1179
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,320
he was teaching a class in

1180
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,640
a skiff not cleared so little siren is

1181
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,760
on right

1182
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,119
and he pulls up that article like the

1183
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,880
snowden thing had recently uh

1184
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,599
happened well in the news article on the

1185
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,880
website

1186
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,359
it shows a picture and it says like

1187
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,200
secret above the picture

1188
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,760
and someone's like sorry um we have to

1189
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,560
pull this down

1190
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,320
because there's unclear people in here

1191
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,720
and they can't see that he's like

1192
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,760
i mean i'm the uncleared person

1193
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,800
it's it's me who you're afraid of

1194
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
seeing that but i'm the one that's

1195
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,560
showing it to you

1196
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
and you're like can't do it sorry the

1197
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,079
lights on you you

1198
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,079
we have to shut this down nobody can it

1199
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,520
was this whole weird circle he's like

1200
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:25,920
yep

1201
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,359
but i'm the one with the it was

1202
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,839
a lovely entertaining circular reasoning

1203
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:32,880
that

1204
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,599
ironically works on the government stuff

1205
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,040
you said the word works

1206
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,400
were you sure that that's the word you

1207
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,920
were trying to use that's not the right

1208
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,240
word

1209
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,599
not the right word efficiently like

1210
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,599
quickly probably not that often

1211
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,960
i have pretty conferences where someone

1212
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,079
will say

1213
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,599
they would grab something from snowden

1214
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,640
and they're like well i'm going to show

1215
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,760
you a secret document so if you're

1216
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,520
government people you have to leave

1217
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,040
so you see a bunch of people who are

1218
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
like i don't i don't know what to do

1219
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,760
here you're like fed

1220
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,800
bad bad

1221
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,040
yeah no so this is actually this is true

1222
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,720
um even if something

1223
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
is on the internet if it has been marked

1224
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,480
as secret or top secret

1225
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,079
somebody with a clearance technically is

1226
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,839
not supposed to look at it because that

1227
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,119
violates your clearance

1228
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,560
to look at something that is readily

1229
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,200
available right but then

1230
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,480
at the top thing they're like wait

1231
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,400
what's worse outing myself

1232
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,440
as someone with that or sitting here

1233
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,640
brain hurts it also works labeling too

1234
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,079
so so one of those pranks that you would

1235
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,680
always pull in like a skiff is if

1236
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,200
somebody was like working on a document

1237
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,560
or something and they printed it out

1238
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,839
uh what you would do is you just like

1239
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,599
grab a marker sharpie and you just like

1240
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,160
go

1241
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,520
s-i-t-k-t-s right on top of it

1242
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,720
and they can't take it out of the uh the

1243
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
skiff anymore cause it's it's marked

1244
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,880
it must be true well i heard somebody

1245
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,079
was they grabbed some of those stickers

1246
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,280
and like it'd be fun to put this on my

1247
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,079
laptop

1248
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,240
and then had a big red sticker on his

1249
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,160
laptop at the tsa and the tsa is like

1250
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,839
we're done here

1251
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,240
it's contraband right i mean technically

1252
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,760
they i mean i'm sure some of those guys

1253
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,560
were former

1254
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,640
military at some [ __ ] like sort of some

1255
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,240
way shape or form so they're like

1256
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,720
i don't know what to do brain lock we're

1257
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,560

the back with different you know green

1260
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
and orange and red that's when you grab

1261
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,680
another one of those stickers and you

1262
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,560
slapped on their back

1263
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,640

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,040
right next to me and he's doing a lot of

1326
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,319
powershell empire but he's trying to

1327
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,680
make a lot of noise with it and he's

1328
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,560
just not getting

1329
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
anything to work at all and he starts

1330
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,480
getting more and more and more and more

1331
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,200
frustrated

1332
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,800
and at a certain point in time he just

1333
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,880
starts getting shells out of nowhere

1334
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,000
but they never fully stage and he's like

1335
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,800
gosh

1336
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,400
i don't even think i loaded anything i

1337
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,560
don't know where this is coming from

1338
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,520
what what i'm on the other side and now

1339
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,960
i'm getting more frustrated because i'm

1340
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,359
like

1341
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,040

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,079
well i was getting access to different

1343
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:02,480
stuff

1344
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,240
and i was doing uh you know all kinds of

1345
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,839
stuff right and now nothing's working

1346
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,760
anymore

1347
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,119
and i look over at tim and i realize

1348
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,359
that he's getting shells from me because

1349

1359
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,720
i had menace point running in another

1360

1361
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,520
accident

uh my last i'll i'll end with a business

1368
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,560
one um which is i think something we can

1369
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,160
all appreciate

1370
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,760
in in the beginning right when when the

1371
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,319
company starts and the honeymoon period

1372
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:02,720
ends

1373
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,160
and you start to realize nobody ever

1374
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,480
pays you on time um you start meeting

1375
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,760
all of the different vagaries of

1376
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,359
customers who

1377
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,000
refuse to pay you for something or take

1378
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,680
advantage of your something

1379
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,280
um and then of course like i said just

1380
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,520
the general they don't pay on time

1381
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,599
and that was that was the first moment

1382
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,800
where we almost broke

1383
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,760
um i can't remember if it was uh i want

1384
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,280
to say that was like

1385
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,640
christmas of 2014 and

1386
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,079
we were two days away from um

1387
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,640
like not being able to make it and i

1388
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,079
started dialing for dollars because i

1389
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:36,800
had six

1390
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,240
customers at that time and i was just

1391
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,880
like if one of you just gave me a check

1392
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,400
if just one of you would please give me

1393
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,040
a check

1394
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,720
like i could get through payroll like i

1395
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
can we can make it another

1396
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,119
payroll period and then like you know

1397
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,920
you know as you know

1398
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,640
right it's one problem at a time and so

1399
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,720
i dialed for dollars and it was like

1400
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,079
right before the deadline that

1401
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,280
somebody he deposited me money um i had

1402
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,800
a personal appeal

1403
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,960
uh to allow us to keep going

1404
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,560
i feel for you i know everyone related

1405
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,760
to that we had

1406
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,040
two different accounts because i like

1407
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,280
them to deposit into one account

1408
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,800
so they can't and i'll immediately sweep

1409
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
that over

1410
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,000
but right before payroll i reversed

1411
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,240
all of the transaction in the reverse

1412
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,119
order

1413
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,920
so i literally ever overdrew every

1414
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,880
single account

1415
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,480
and i know i'm in singapore so i'm

1416
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,079
trying to get this done really quickly

1417
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,880
because i'm like oh

1418
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,200
crap time zones this is going to happen

1419
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,000
literally i

1420
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,760
overdrew every single account because

1421
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,599
everything transferred the wrong ways

1422
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,119
except for this

1423
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,359
one stupid account that it had all of

1424
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,800
the money

1425
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,240
