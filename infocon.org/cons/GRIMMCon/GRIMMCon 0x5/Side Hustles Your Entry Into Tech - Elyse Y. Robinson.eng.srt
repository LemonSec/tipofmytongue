1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,280
hey y'all

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,359
my name is liz robinson i'm excited to

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,039
be here today

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,439
and i'll start off with the introduction

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,560
and then go into my top

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,960
into tech so again my name is elise

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,000
robinson i am a cloud engineer

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
and my journey into tech started at 10

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
years old

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,920
and so my parents got me my first

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
computer

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,960
and uh it was a packer bell

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,559
and i just simply remember to have four

14
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,719
megabytes of ram

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,199
um because i wanted to play a computer

16
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,320
game that was

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,199
eight megabytes

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
and so it cost two thousand dollars and

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,320
it was huge and clunky

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,760
and made all kinds of noise

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,040
and so i woke up one day and was like

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,920
well

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,799
i want to know how those websites work

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,280
and

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,560
so i started off with the website i just

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,600
think you still remember

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
and luckily it still exists um

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,920
it's called lisa explains it all

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,840
it's this hot pink and hot purple

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,759
website and you learn about html

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,880
css and javascript on it

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,720
and uh so i'm plugging through on it

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,079
probably using notepad

34
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,000
because i really don't think there was

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
too much anything

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,200
to work with at all back then and

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
um so i'm building websites

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
you know little stupid websites

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,720
over the years and then that progressed

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,399
to me taking visual basic and c

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,079
plus plus in high school now

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
i was going to be a computer science

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,799
major but i couldn't find an internship

44
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,200
to save my life so i switched to

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,479
accounting

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,679
i ended up becoming an auditor

47
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
for a number of years and so

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,879
unlike i t um accounting is

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,280
much much different um you know having

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,319
jumping through all these

51
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,720
hoops

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,200
and so um

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,120
yeah i kept up with my my

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,959
web development skills so i would

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,760
so i've never had to pay anyone to

56
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,319
design

57
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,360
anything for me and so that was one

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
skill that i taught myself

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,640
at 10 years old

60
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,560
then life happened i moved to mexico for

61
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,599
a number of years

62
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,640
and so i fell back on my i.t skills i do

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,200
consulting

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
you know and so covet has changed the

65
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,920
whole world and so since i couldn't go

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,519
out and do the things that i normally

67
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,959
did

68
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,000
i was like well you know maybe i should

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,879
you know get on some more self learning

70
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,879
i haven't done that in a long long long

71
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,239
time

72
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,640
and so um

73
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,760
i was like well i'm going to teach

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,239
myself python maybe possibly

75
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,360
and so i got on twitter for whatever

76
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
reason and started searching about

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,400
tech stuff i'm like oh they have a whole

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
tech twitter

79
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,159
and uh so i started getting involved in

80
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,920
that and doing hashtags

81
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,200
and uh you know updating my progress

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,799
um i don't know if you've heard of 100

83
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,720
days of code and

84
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,400
aws certified as hashtags um

85
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
the dev community is another hashtag so

86
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,799
i started getting popular and people

87
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,920
started following me

88
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,478
and following my progress and so

89
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,680
um the other thing that's huge in the

90
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,479
tech industry

91
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,919
of certifications correct so of course i

92
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,880
had and i was

93
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,880
on there and so i was like well how

94
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,520
can i afford to pay for these mind you i

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,919
live

96
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,359
in mexico which

97
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
is a very very cheap country and so

98
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,960
one certification is

99
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,639
a lot of money a lot of money and

100
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,400
they make it hard for someone that lives

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
in another country to get these

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,960
certifications

103
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,479
but you know barrier entry

104
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,600
barriers of injury uh

105
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
i want a strong survive right

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,320
so um

107
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,120
i fell back on my honey skills which is

108
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,600
pretty much

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
research skills and so i was like well

110
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
how can i not have to pay for these

111
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,080
things and i got on google

112
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,960
and twitter and linkedin and a bunch of

113
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,280
other places that post good stuff

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,479
and started searching

115
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,840
and so i started winning all these

116
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,479
things i got uh event tickets

117
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,919
um to the twilio event last year obama

118
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,720
was there

119
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,240
they had all these great topics um

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,720
i want to scholarship to a boot camp to

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,280
learn

122
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,880
um python all types of free courses i've

123
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,440
won

124
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
free certifications from microsoft and

125
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,240
aws and google i have

126
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,360
like these things but

127
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,039
um what else scholarships

128
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,960
um and then

129
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,639
you know a bunch of other things that i

130
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,319
want to people like

131
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,400
how are you wearing these things i'm

132
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
like i just search

133
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,319
you know searching is your friend if

134
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,840
you're going to be in tech you have to

135
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
know how to search

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,440
um and so backing up

137
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,080
like i said i was an i.t consultant and

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,120
so

139
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
i learned more about the cloud that's

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,360
one thing i said i wasn't going to miss

141
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,560
um was getting into the cloud it seems

142
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,120
like it's going to stay here for

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,240
the near future the far future

144
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,479
and so i started learning more about the

145
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,360
cloud

146
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,759
and one of the things that i built when

147
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,800
i was in mexico

148
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
was a blog a podcast youtube channel all

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,199
that stuff to

150
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,319
portray my black american woman life

151
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,000
in in mexico and so

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,759
i built the podcast on aws i also built

153
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,160
my subscription service for email

154
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
on aws there's all types of tutorials

155
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
out there on how to do it

156
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,599
and so mind you i knew nothing about

157
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,000
cloud

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
and nothing about how to build these

159
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,080
things and so i taught myself how to do

160
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,880
them

161
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,319
um and so

162
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
going back to twitter and tweeting out

163
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,479
my progress everyone wanted to know how

164
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,479
i was doing these things and i said

165
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,840
well i just searched and so that's how

166
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
my my business

167
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,440
my project and how i got

168
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
tons of interviews was by building news

169
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,960
in it

170
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,840
that's www.news in

171
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,000
it and so

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,840
going into my topic um side hustles your

173
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,560
entry in

174
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,479
tech i built it using

175
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,879
python css html javascript

176
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,000
google sheets and at the time it was aws

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
i don't use aws anymore because it

178
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,560
doesn't

179
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,520
charge me something i got credits but um

180
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,360
it became the talk of every interview

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,440
that i did i put on my resumes on my

182
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,720
linkedin

183
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,759
and i also learned how to build

184
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,840
a twitter bot in a linkedin box

185
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,319
using a virtual machine docker selenium

186
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,599
python and of course

187
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,799
that starts the interview process too

188
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,718
based off my resume and my linkedin

189
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,559
and so my tip and trick is to

190
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,279
build something that your number one

191
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,480
passion about

192
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,519
number two you know really nothing about

193
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,680
so you can improve your skills

194
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,959
and number three something that's

195
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,680
unique and i can get you in front of

196
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,800
recruiters and

197
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,560
hiring managers um

198
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,760
one thing about news and i t is that i

199
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,640
built it

200
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
i launched it on a sunday and i have my

201
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
first customers on

202
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,200
on monday and so that opens up more

203
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,440
more dialogue with people because you're

204
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,320
like well

205
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,080
how'd you find out that this would be

206
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
something that would be successful

207
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,120
i sure as hell didn't i sure as hell

208
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
didn't but people said that they wanted

209
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,279
to know

210
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,040
so i'm saying see how it does my first

211
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
my first website was crap i launched it

212
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
and it's crap and that's the other thing

213
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,560
don't be scared to launch

214
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,040
and it's not perfect um you'll figure

215
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,720
out how to make it better

216
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,839
um and so

217
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,640
um i got lots of publicity too as i was

218
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
lucky in that regard

219
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,240
i've been in a lot of tech uh tech

220
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
places

221
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,839
um and so

222
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,399
that opens up dialogue and the way it

223
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,760
opens up dialogue

224
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,120
is you are able to

225
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,000
tell stories and i call those stories

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
because

227
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,720
um they are stories and so when an

228
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
interview person is

229
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,800
able to ask you a question you already

230
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,399
have something to talk about because

231
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,920
you've done it before you

232
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
don't say well you know i don't have the

233
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
experience i've never done it but she

234
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,399
did do it and

235
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,200
um you're able to talk about it in depth

236
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,399
because it's your baby

237
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,680
it's something that she launched

238
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,519
something that she did

239
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,959
um and

240
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,560
i'll say there's nothing wrong with

241
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
doing copycats

242
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,560
projects i've done a ton of those like

243
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
they built a whatsapp

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,360
because these optics um

245
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
and so when you build those projects too

246
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,839
that's outside of your main project it

247
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,680
also gives you the stories to be able to

248
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,640
talk about

249
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,480
anything and everything that that

250
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,160
interviewer wants

251
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,320
um now mind you mine applies more to

252
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,399
cloud because that's what i do i'm a

253
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
cloud engineer so i built my

254
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,079
my projects around the cloud but

255
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,120
no matter what whether it's networking

256
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,160
or

257
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,320
programming security or whatever trying

258
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
to find something

259
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
that is unique and that will

260
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,640
you know get people talking about you

261
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,160
specifically and

262
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,519
you'll have stories to tell

263
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,959
when i went into my interview at my

264
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,160
company

265
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,440
um my boss was very

266
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,720
very intrigued by me

267
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,040
probably because you know i was a black

268
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,199
woman that lived in mexico at one

269
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
but also that i built something from

270
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
nothing and made it successful

271
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,600
using all different types of tools that

272
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,680
i knew nothing about before

273
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,040
never heard of

274
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,519
of two by building these projects i

275
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,959
wouldn't say stick to

276
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,200
something that you know learn all

277
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,639
different types of things

278
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,079
because you might find something that

279
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,760
you really want to pursue and love

280
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,920
too

281
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,800
and with that said with that said

282
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,720
side hustles your entry into tech um

283
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,839
be sure to build things that you know

284
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,600
nothing about so you'll have stories

285
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,240
you'll make

286
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
you'll make errors you'll make mistakes

287
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
and you'll figure out how to fix

288
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,560
them which is everything in tech um

289
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,519
to learn how to google because i google

290
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,440
all kinds of things every single day

291
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,279
that i knew nothing about it learn about

292
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,320
them

293
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,639
um ask for help if you don't know

294
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,760
um it's funny my my friend's been in

295
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,519
it forever and i told him that i've

296
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,040
never even worked in iot

297
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
but people trust me as an expert all of

298
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,800
a sudden because i built

299
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,940
news at 19.

300
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,920
[Music]

301
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,000
and he gets mad about it i don't care

302
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,560
i remember his face and chances i'm an

303
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
expert and you're not

304
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,000
but um it makes you an expert

305

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,839
someone is asking if you use django or

343
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,199
flask or something else

344
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,759
um for my website or just in general

345
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,360
say for your website probably probably

346
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,040
or in general go do say both

347
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
um i've used flask

348
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,440
before i believe not i don't think i've

349
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,480
ever used django

350
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,360
um and no my website does not use either

351
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,560
okay

352
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,000
out of all the stuff you've taught

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,279
yourself what do you think was the

354
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,800
hardest and how did you

355
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,000
overcome that heart that hardness

356
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,519
the hardest it's actually a good

357
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,800
question

358
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,639
um i don't know

359
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,800
these are is pretty hard

360
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,959
only because when i first learned

361
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,880
programming i was a child so i had

362
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
nothing else going on in my life

363
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,199
but now that i have other things it's

364
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,320
like okay

365
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,360
i need to pass these exams for work and

366
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
study and you know so i don't crash a

367
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,519
server or whatever

368
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,320
so yeah i have to say this right now

369
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,839
okay

370
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,880
uh what was your go ahead as a crashing

371
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,839
a the server's bad

372
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
just a little bit depends on up time

373
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
right if you need the uptime if you

374
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,079
don't need up time then you're good

375
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,519
then i mean maybe you're fine yeah

376
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,839
stress test

377
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,000
what was it do you have another question

378
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,320
that you're reading from the chat wade

379
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,279
uh nothing that i see let me read

380
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,120
through it

381
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
no i think we're all good on those

382
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,720
questions

383
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
uh what was do you think did you teach

384
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
yourself to google or did you use any

385
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,480
type of

386
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,679
um literature or what what do you think

387
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,880
really drove you to learn how to use

388
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,839
google because i do feel like that is a

389
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,240
huge

390
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,799
that's like the first huge task or first

391
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,400
huge lesson that a lot of people

392
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,760
in it really learn is how to google

393
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,160
properly and how to like pick out links

394
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
um how did you learn that

395
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,880
um i don't know i guess you have to read

396
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,559
through the the literature and figure

397
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:36,960
out

398
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,640
what exactly well first of all you have

399
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
to figure out what the problem

400
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,039
is that you're trying to solve of course

401
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,919
and then

402
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,160
read through everything copy and paste

403
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,480
try it if it doesn't work

404
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,440
try the next thing

405
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
so because you're probably never going

406
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,760
to figure out

407
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
something that's exactly like your

408
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,679
problem but you can figure out something

409
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,200
that is adjacent to it

410
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,880
and you know something that's kind of

411
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,480
the same and then go from there

412
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,200
so oh yeah yeah i often found that like

413
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,280
in the beginning i would i knew what the

414
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,640
program was doing so something wasn't

415
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,320
installing or wasn't working i'd be like

416
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,440
why is my

417
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
cali not installing on blah blah blah

418
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,960
one what i should have just done was

419
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,600
literally

420
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,080
copy the error code and google the error

421
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,720
code

422
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
because if you google just the error you

423
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,760
get the standard output

424
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
you're gonna find the forums where like

425
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
dozens of people have commented things

426
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,559
that they've tried and workarounds that

427
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,520
they found

428
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,080
much faster than like because how web

429
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,120
spidering works

430
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
versus how like humans think in syntax

431
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,880
is very different

432
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
so that's actually a really good point

433
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,720
and also

434
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,799
just because it's 10 years old does not

435
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,559
mean that it still does not work

436
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,480
i've literally found things that were 10

437
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,600
years old

438
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,639
and it still works

439
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
so don't think it's too too aged out for

440
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
it not to work

441
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
no it's still baked into there somewhere

442
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,400
so something that a lot of people don't

443
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,480
understand about risk

444
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
and vulnerability is you like generally

445
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,840
cannot remove

446
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,320
risk you can only mitigate around it you

447
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,240
can pile stuff on top to make it maybe

448
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,520
not so bad or not so

449
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,080
easily accessible but vulnerabilities

450
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
are still in there if you can get around

451
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,399
enough of them

452
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,799
risk i used to be an auditor so nothing

453
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,240
that we we try to

454
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,520
mitigate the risk yeah

455
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,320
we all try but the reason we're horrible

456
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,120
at it is the reason i still have a job

457
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,520
yep good old compliance

458
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,160
let's see uh what other what what's your

459
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,240
favorite technology that you've learned

460
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,720
through this adventure it would have to

461
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,520
be my first

462
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,960
love html it does so much

463
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,559
and people try to say that it's not a

464
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,320
language and i'm like well we wouldn't

465
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,280
have

466
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,760
all this stuff that we have that now

467
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,039
without html

468
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,159
so how do you figure

469
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,120
i mean that's true html is very near and

470
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,640
dear to my heart because anyone who had

471
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,720
a facebook profile that they wanted

472
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,960
stuff to scroll across it and junk like

473
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,600
or customize

474
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
myspace but i'll give it to you oh was

475
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,640
it always in my space

476
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,039
yeah that's how old it is yeah anyone

477
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,960
had a myspace and wanted to be fancy

478
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,919
knew some html but nowadays you know i

479
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,840
am largely a client-side attack person

480
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
and i am doing a lot of html and a lot

481
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,039
of javascript like

482
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,480
all day so i used to embed like

483
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,520
a games into my into my myspace via

484
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,840
html i learned yeah

485
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,600
way back when yeah i had to say html

486
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,520
that's that's the first language i that

487
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
i learned and

488
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,320
i mean nothing would really

489
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,400
be usable without html it just looked

490
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,380
like google

491
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,200
[Laughter]

492
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:03,840
yeah that's very true that's very true

493
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,120
you
