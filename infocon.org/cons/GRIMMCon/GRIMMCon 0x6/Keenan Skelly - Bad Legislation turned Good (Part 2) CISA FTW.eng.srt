00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,480
thank you for coming to listen to my my

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,480
crazy ramblings on critical

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,920
infrastructure and critical

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
infrastructure legislation

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,480
uh very much a passion of mine and at

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
the last gram i actually talked about

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,040
some of the legislative fails that we've

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,880
had in critical infrastructure security

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,960
and building out cesa and kind of where

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,320
we came from but this time it's po

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,160
and we're actually going to dive into

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,520
some of the really great things that

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,120
have happened over the last couple of

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,680
months and since our last talk so let's

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,239
dive right in

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,719
maybe

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,960
maybe

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,960
seriously

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,840
okay

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,479
okay there we go

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,040
this is really interesting okay so who

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
am i why should you care uh you probably

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
shouldn't i'm i'm a strange strange cat

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,880
who's been doing critical infrastructure

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,799
for a very long time actually a plank

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,840
owner at nppd which was um what came

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,080
before cesa and a lot of the work that

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,799
we did on you know vulnerability

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,880
assessments and kind of understanding

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,439
systems approaches to things helped to

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,000
create things like the chemical security

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,240
program things like sisa and the form

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,400
that we know it today so that's why i

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,600
kind of talk about critical

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
infrastructure a lot i love it i've

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,320
always been very fascinated by it i do a

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,799
couple other things um i'm the ceo of a

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,479
company called shadow bite and we do

43
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,240
threat intelligence

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,799
i also have my own uh kind of advisory

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,800
guys want to learn more about cyber

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,479
security legislation from the point of

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,440
the view

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
that i have as kind of a security

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,160
researcher and a business owner and then

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,959
also some of the things that legislators

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,480
have to say when they're creating this

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
legislation then you should totally

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
check it out

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,920
um most importantly i'm a gamer i love

61

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
oh you're kidding me right now with this

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,840
aren't you

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
there we go okay so what are we going to

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,400
talk about today

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
the last talk that we had about those

71
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
critical infrastructure stuff um we kind

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,120
of focused on the early days of dhs and

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,200
really what the legislative challenges

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
were in this organization kind of

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,159
becoming its own thing for example you

76
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,239
know when you bring together uh you know

77
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,720
22 different agencies and you try to

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800
smoosh them all together in one new

79
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
agency there's bound to be

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
some crazy crazy things that that happen

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
there and some growing pains and i think

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,239
the last 15 years specifically of dhs

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,720
have demonstrated that we've seen lots

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,200
of reorgs lots of changes in structure

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,519
lots of who's really in charge of this

86
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,519
who's really in charge of that and it's

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,799
just now over the last couple of years

88
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,519
through largely you know some standout

89
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,000
folks like chris krebs and jen easterly

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
who we're going to talk about a little

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
bit today who really kind of changed

92
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
that paradigm a little bit to get dhs

93
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,519
moving in the right direction especially

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,280
when it comes to security and cyber

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,319
security

96
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
so this time we're going to dial into

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,319
cesa a little bit more and some of the

98
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,760
cool things that are going on there

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
we're going to talk about my girl crush

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,040
on jen easterly because she's just

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,120
amazing and i love her to death

102
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
um we're also going to talk about some

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
of the legislation that it has been

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
passed or is being passed over the last

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
couple of months that's really affected

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,799
sisa's ability to do their job but we're

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,400
also going to talk about

108
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,799
what different things mean when we say

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,280
legislation because i see a lot of

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,159
people

111
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
you know will respond to a news headline

112
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,798
that says on the floor there's a bill

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,639
that will do this and everybody gets all

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
up in arms we're going to talk about

115
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,519
what that really means

116
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,600
um and then of course highlighting the

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,440
things that cesa has done um we

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,479
we we need a very specific new kind of

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,320
strategy for cyber security and i think

120
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,479
everybody here can agree that log4j has

121
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,639
kind of really changed some perspectives

122
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,960
about what that collaboration means and

123
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
what it should look like in the future

124
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,520
um also hashtag not my batman

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,560
next slide

126
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
okay

127
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,479
first things first

128
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,479
let's just take a minute to appreciate

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,199
this amazing badass human being jen

130
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
easterly the director of sisa um who

131
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
everybody kind of fell in love with

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,320
almost instantly when she did her first

133
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,120
black hat talk wearing this amazing

134
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,919
you know chinese blue jeans outfit and

135
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,919
uh and t-shirts that said free britney

136
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,720
which by the way britney is now free

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,639
correlation i don't know

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
um if you ask us

139
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,120
at ray redacted on twitter he thinks

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
she's amazing because she solves rubik's

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,240
cubes um she embraces her hacker ethos

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
which i totally agree with

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,240
and um you know she's created a new

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,320
paradigm for public

145
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,400
private partnership and i totally agree

146
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,840
with that but there's also some other

147
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
things that she's been doing over the

148
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
last couple of months that have really

149
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,560
really changed um

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,080
change the paradigm and i hate that word

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
paradigm but change the paradigm in what

152
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
cybersecurity collaboration across the

153
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,919
government is meant to look like and how

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,800
to get industry more involved just like

155
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
uh you know kris krebs and honestly just

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,240
like the mission of mppd and then cesa

157
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,120
since the very beginning private sector

158
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
government um you know public sector

159
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,240
these

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
collaborations are an absolute must if

161
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
we're going to get anything right so

162
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,639
some of the reasons that i am absolutely

163
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,520
fascinated and impressed with what jen

164
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
and chris english have been able to do

165
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,840
here

166
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,080
uh well first of all she was just named

167
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,759
um the

168
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,520
the cyber security person of the year

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,319
which i totally get behind and there's a

170
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,759
few articles you can read about that

171
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,000
will tell you all of those reasons and

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
and they're good reasons but some of my

173
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,919
personal reasons um she comes from

174
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,880
offense right so she comes from a much

175
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,680
more offensive security perspective and

176
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
i've said this a million times and i'll

177
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
say it you know every day and twice on

178
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
sunday to truly understand how to defend

179
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
anything you have to be able to

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,639
understand how the bad guys are using it

181
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,039
i say this uh you know when i was at eod

182
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,560
tech there's a reason that they taught

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,520
us to make chemical weapons to make

184
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
nuclear weapons to make ieds so that we

185
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
would understand how the bad guys were

186
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,880
thinking about explosives and every time

187
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,720
that changed we learned more about it

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,039
and it made us better at our jobs and

189
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,560
that's absolutely true when we're

190
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,639
talking about cyber security you can

191
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,280
never be a good defender if you don't

192
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,240
truly understand the capabilities of the

193
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
offender and i think that's a unique uh

194
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
a uniquely new and desperately needed uh

195
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,840
piece for cesa

196
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,720
now

197
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,440
being very very public on the hill this

198
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,599
is something that um you know kris krebs

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,000
did this also um and jen is doing it

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,319
with her own style which i really am

201
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,520
impressed with so being able to be a

202
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,599
government employee at this high of a

203
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,840
level um often it's difficult to say

204
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,000
specifically what you think without

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
getting you know kind of rumbles from

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,240
the hill or rumbles from political

207
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
pieces that you know you don't really

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,039
want

209
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,440
that said when you're able to speak

210
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
freely and without worrying about those

211
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
political issues it makes you so much

212
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,759
more powerful and this is something we

213
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,240
saw with chris krebs but uh like i said

214
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,000
jen's doing it in her own way and she's

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,639
been very vocal about specific things

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,759
for example bisma

217
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,080
absolutely promoting the idea that for

218
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,319
her organization to you know thrive and

219
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,400
for cyber security to really thrive that

220
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
feisma has to be updated um you know

221
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
things like this type cyber is a team

222
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,599
sport and it absolutely is a team sport

223
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,879
that ethos and and rob inglis his ethos

224
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,720
of collaboration across not just

225
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,039
government agencies but you know using

226
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,799
the private sector using the public

227
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,519
sector um is exactly what we need to

228
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,679
continue in cyber security so that's

229
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,319
really great

230
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,040
let's talk about legislation now

231
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,880
so this year in the 117th congress

232
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,279
there have been

233
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,000
370 separate bills and resolutions

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
during this this time and what i what i

235
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
mean by cyber bills or resolutions is

236
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
that

237
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
that's how many bills and resolutions

238
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
address something that has to do with

239
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
cyber security now i want to go over

240
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,399
this kind of what's the difference

241
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,760
between a bill and a resolution and and

242
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,800
and because it's important when we as

243
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,399
cyber security professionals

244
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,360
organizations and public sector members

245
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
start looking at how this is going to

246
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
affect us how it affects our business

247
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
how it affects how we have to act every

248
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,480
day

249
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,279
so

250
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,519
370

251
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,880
there are bills and there are

252
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,160
resolutions

253
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,040
remember that a bill somebody you know

254
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
you read in the news all the time well

255
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,080
there's a bill in the house floor

256
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
there's a bill on the senate floor

257
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,160
a bill has been enacted as a point or

258
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,760
plan of action

259
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,080
that means there is something else for

260
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,000
the rest of the government to do

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
they are going to provide that

262
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,279
overarching kind of guideline and

263
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,200
they're going to expect other people in

264
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
government like dhs or

265
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,600
nsa or dot dot dot to actually execute

266
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,360
on that legislation

267
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
a resolution however is just an adoption

268
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
or an agreement among that particular

269
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,399
committee that

270
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
that particular um you know

271
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,839
caucus whatever that is and those are

272
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,399
great and sometimes they're very useful

273
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
and sometimes you'll see these things

274
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,839
happen kind of in coordination with each

275
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,920
other which is how it's supposed to be

276
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,720
but i want all of you i want all of the

277
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,440
listeners to go back to your your 10th

278
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,240
grade civics lessons and remember what

279
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,440
that means

280
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,320
so instead of freaking out as you know i

281
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,200
often do every time i see um you know a

282
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
bill about incident reporting which

283
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
we're going to talk about and failed

284
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,640
bills about incident reporting the media

285
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,680
tends to hop on these things as if they

286
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,560
are

287
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
definitely going to happen

288
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
this bill is going to make you report in

289
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
24 hours and that's that that's all you

290
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,399
get

291
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
and that kind of starts panic

292
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
when you start talking to you know

293
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,920
organizations who are working in cyber

294
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
security exclusively but

295
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,880
definitely those who fit outside of

296
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,279
general cyber security like banks or

297
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,200
other critical infrastructure

298
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
so remember that just because a bill has

299
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,519
been introduced and just because a bill

300
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,560
maybe has passed one either the house or

301
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,040
the senate does not mean that it is

302
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,519
enacted that it is a law but here's what

303
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,279
it does mean and this is the most

304
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,959
important thing you can take from this

305
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,120
slide entirely

306
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,839
when a bill is introduced you

307
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,760
as the american citizen have the

308
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,880
opportunity to influence how it is

309
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,519
written and how it goes forward

310
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,200
input from you to your senator to your

311
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,480
representative and to those caucuses is

312
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,120
absolutely crucial now i think everybody

313
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
here has kind of heard um you know what

314
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,079
can i really do

315
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,240
i'm a big organization and all i can

316
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,959
hope to do is maybe let them hear

317
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,720
uh this group that i've put together let

318
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
them hear kind of what they think

319
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,720
but you can do a lot more than that by

320
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,639
getting involved in understanding the

321
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,440
legislation that's being created

322
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,760
you can ultimately help shape how that

323
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,320
legislation actually passes and i'm

324
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
going to use the incident reporting bill

325
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,120
um

326
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
three of three of the um incident

327
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,760
reporting bills that were actually

328
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,519
introduced towards the end of this year

329
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,920
none of them got passed and all for good

330
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,880
reason

331
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,680
but

332
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
by following each of them and taking the

333
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
things that were important from each one

334
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
and pushing them kind of together and

335
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,160
then making that checklist of okay these

336
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
are the areas where we are really

337
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,639
missing or completely shy on

338
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,200
let's focus on that for the next bill

339
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
that's going to come out

340
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
you can help you can make changes and

341
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,040
you should be interested in this if

342
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,440
you're a ceo a cso

343
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
if you're a massive company and you

344
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,880
don't have a legislative affairs person

345
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,800
i highly recommend that you do

346
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,040
okay

347
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
so once to watch

348
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,720
there were so many 370 370 different

349
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,440
bills or resolutions that's a lot

350
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,519
but some obviously get more press than

351
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,560
others obviously the infrastructure bill

352
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,880
now the bipartisan infrastructure law

353
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,959
has gotten a lot of attention for cyber

354
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,480
security because of the perceived

355
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
lack of budget that is actually going to

356
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
cyber security so if you look on this

357
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,920
slide

358
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,279
you can see that

359
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,680
way way way way at the bottom it says

360
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,839
cyber security and other infrastructure

361
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,199
programs 10

362
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,639
uh points 11 billion dollars

363
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,240
now if you look at this little slice of

364
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,040
pie and how much the whole rest of the

365
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,399
the trillion dollar

366
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,120
uh law actually addresses you can say

367
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,199
okay well that's really not very much

368
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,959
for cyber security right i mean it kind

369
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,560
of looks like they're ignoring us

370
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
entirely

371
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,639
but you have to remember that every

372
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,240
single one of these other pieces

373
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,800
transportation funding roads bridges

374
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,839
freight and passenger rail broadband

375
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,880
public transportation airports uh army

376
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,399
corps of engineers

377
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,360
ports and coast guard every single one

378
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,839
of these pieces of infrastructure is

379
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,560
built on information and information

380
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,199
security every single one of them when

381
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,199
we talk about really

382
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,680
changing infrastructure in this country

383
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,920
i always think about

384
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
back in the day when i was at dhs when

385
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
we did the water system we did

386
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,600
assessments for that

387
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,040
looking at a dam and and what exactly a

388
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,639
dam has to rely on in a systems approach

389
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,120
to be able to do its job and to be able

390
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
to protect all of the things that are in

391
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,079
its second and third order effects

392
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,839
well you might say probably nothing

393
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,600
right but that's not true

394
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
if we're going to modernize the entire

395
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,040
electric grid that massively affects

396
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
that dam if we're going to massively

397
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,240
update how we get freight from one point

398
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
in the country to another point point in

399
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,839
the country safely

400
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,760
that is going to be

401
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,560
interacting and affecting all of these

402
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,920
other pieces

403
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,480
so i encourage you as you think about

404
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,639
this particular build not to think of it

405
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,360
as we got screwed because we only got

406
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
10.11 billion but look at it

407
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,639
as in every single one of these other

408
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
pieces is critical and has a critical

409
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,440
reliability on cyber security

410
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,600
don't forget

411
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,880
the incident reporting saga

412
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,959
of 2021

413
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,959
if you have seen any of my other talks

414
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,560
or you listen to the national blast you

415
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,000
will know that this

416
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
is something that's very important to me

417
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,199
um you know it's not the i'm not the

418
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
first one to to jump on this kind of um

419
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,079
or jump in front of this moving train

420
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,759
there have been a lot of people before

421
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,240
me we've been talking about this for

422
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
ages and ages we've been talking about

423
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,560
you know um the uh all of the the bills

424
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
and laws that are currently in place

425
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
that really make it difficult for

426
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,360
internet reporting for some people and

427
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,839
easy for other people and incident

428
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,519
reporting as it may take or as it

429
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,079
pertains to a company or an organization

430
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,000
who may have been breached and all of

431
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,839
the litany of things that they go

432
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,720
through

433
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
right so

434
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
if we think about

435
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,440
congress coming together over the last

436
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,560
you know six months or so and each house

437
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,240
okay the house and the senate uh and

438
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,399
then on each side republicans and

439
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,880
democrats creating their own versions of

440
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,320
incident reporting

441
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,519
based on the handful of

442
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,160
cyber security experts that they are

443
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,079
talking to and dealing with

444
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,839
if you read through each of these and

445
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,160
now i don't expect any of you to be as

446
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,759
nerdy as i am

447
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,320
and read all of these bills but i have

448
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,240
and there's this great chart and i've

449
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,319
just put part of it here because again

450
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
if you're in cyber security if you're a

451
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,880
ceo a cso if you're running an incident

452
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,839
response team if you're the legal team

453
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,280
who's trying to keep your company out of

454
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,319
trouble

455
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,480
get this report it was done by

456
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,119
crs congressional reports and the link

457
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,760
is right here but you can look side by

458
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,640
side at all of these and just a random

459
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,799
side note um

460
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,039
this reporting agency actually puts

461
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,440
together packets like this all the time

462
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
so often there are bills that are

463
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,360
competing with each other to do the

464
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,799
exact same thing

465
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,600
in this case obviously kind of the same

466
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,919
and it's really good and easy to go

467
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,440
through each kind of little thing with

468
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
them stacked together like this i highly

469
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,400
do not recommend going in and trying to

470
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,039
read every single bill independently

471
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
like me because i'm a nerd

472
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,880
so let's talk about just quickly

473
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,799
the good things and the bad things about

474
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,240
internet reporting so if you're a hacker

475
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,000
if you're a security researcher right

476
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,440
away the first thing that you really

477
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,559
hate is the cfaa it's ruining lives it's

478
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,799
making people get sued it's making

479
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,280
lawyers more powerful it's also jacking

480
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,440
up the whole process right of incident

481
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,480
reporting if you can't go to a company

482
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,320
or the government and say

483
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,559
hey i found this vulnerability or you

484
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,679
got breached

485
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,520
here i want to help you

486
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,200
without

487
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,520
being sued without being you know

488
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,919
ignored completely without being you

489
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
know a part of the process in a

490
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,679
meaningful way

491
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,240
then why would you do that job why would

492
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,360
you do that

493
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,280
and unfortunately we need those people

494
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,960
we need the hackers we need the security

495
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,840
researchers because they account for 70

496
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,080
plus percent of all breaches that are

497
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
actually reported

498
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,320
so as we take a look or as you take a

499
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,400
look and again please download the

500
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,320
report and read it individually as you

501
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,240
start looking through this report you're

502
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,480
going to notice that there are a lot of

503
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
things missing from every single one of

504
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,080
these bills and that's always the case

505
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,360
there are a lot of things missing when

506
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,240
it comes to how to handle truly handle

507
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
third-party reporting now they talk

508
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,320
about third-party reporting but only in

509
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,039
the way of a specific company who might

510
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,039
be reporting another company but it

511
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,200
doesn't address what that means in terms

512
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,640
of let's say supply chain issues so

513
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,600
a random example if your company xyz and

514
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,559
you have you know 15 companies that

515
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,640
provide you um you know supplies and

516
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,600
materials and you want to report one of

517
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,160
them or they want to report one of you

518
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,919
what does that look like

519
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,559
would you do that why would you do that

520
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,320
why wouldn't you work together

521
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,280
because everybody's afraid of getting

522
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,640
sued

523
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,799
and screwed and we don't we don't want

524
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,400
that culture anymore we don't need that

525
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,840
culture

526
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
so being able to

527
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,760
not necessarily fine-tune these but

528
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,919
actually compare the the good things and

529
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,080
the bad things and take from that what

530
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,480
we can do for the next round is

531
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,039
absolutely crucial now thankfully like i

532
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,520
said before none of these passed uh

533
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
there was a partial incident response

534
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,480
legislation that was put into the ndaa

535
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,799
at the last minute that was taken out

536
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,200
that regarded the incident response and

537
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
it's a good thing that it was

538
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,840
but now like i said before you have the

539
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,799
opportunity to help shape the next bill

540
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,200
that comes talk to your congressman talk

541
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,159
to your senator talk to whatever caucus

542
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,400
is creating the next piece of cyber

543
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,559
legislation and make sure you understand

544
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,960
how it's going to affect you otherwise

545
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
you're kind of just sitting back and

546
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,720
watching them come up with you know more

547
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,000
things like cmmc that is

548
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,679
a whole other story that we won't get

549
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,960
into

550
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,159
so

551
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,919
that's internet reporting and by the way

552
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,159
i can go into this in so much more

553
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,159
detail but i don't want to bore you guys

554
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,840
so if you're interested in it reach out

555
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,679
to me and uh we'll wax nostalgic about

556
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,880
all of the things that happened this

557
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,080
year with internet reporting

558
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
now let's talk about some of the cool

559
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,520
things that fisa has actually been able

560
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,559
to do and that jen and chris have been

561
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,960
really pushing that i love that i

562
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,240
absolutely love

563
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,159
the bug hunt as a business

564
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,200
now

565
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
you guys are going to say oh well people

566
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,880
have been doing bug bounties for ever

567
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,280
it's not a big deal it's not it's not

568
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,960
nothing new and you know we shouldn't

569
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,720
get too excited about it

570
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
i beg to differ

571
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,600
when you have a hacker former hacker in

572
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,320
charge of a defense organization who

573
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,559
sees things again from that point of

574
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,280
view from that offense point of view you

575
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,679
get a whole culture shift in what that

576
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,039
actually means

577
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,440
very happy to say that dhs came out with

578
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,679
their bug hunt program just i think it

579
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,440
was a week ago

580
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,320
allowing you to go in and try to hack

581
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,520
their system

582
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
now government agencies the department

583
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,440
of defense has done this other agencies

584
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,640
have done this

585
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,200
but the bigger issue here is that it

586
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,400
gets us to the most important part of

587
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,880
all of this and that is normalizing the

588
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,799
breach okay

589
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,280
we have already seen with you know log

590
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,520
4j solar winds microsoft exchange the

591
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,400
the litany of issues that we've seen

592
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,360
in cyber security in 2021 we've already

593
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,240
seen that you're going to get breached

594
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,640
we know it it's not a statistical

595
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
probability or it's not

596
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,320
a maybe it's an if or an if it's a when

597
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,600
so

598
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,039
why don't we just all embrace that

599
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,240
culture book hunt as a business standard

600
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,280
practice

601
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,679
make sure you have you know kind of your

602
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,320
your vulnerability reporting um

603
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
documentation good to go but let's

604
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,559
continue to push this idea for

605
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,520
government for private sector for public

606
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,360
sector for everyone

607
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,120
let's start working together right

608
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
so that's something i've really liked

609
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,640
the other thing that jen has been saying

610
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,200
over and over in the media and i i i

611
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,120
just want to give her a hug a

612
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,240
non-touching hug because it's covered

613
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,360
but

614
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,200
hire the hackers

615
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,520
fire the hackers

616
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,280
you know all the security researchers i

617
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,600
know all the hackers i know are

618
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,720
really great human beings really are and

619
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,280
they want to help this is what they they

620
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
do they create businesses so that they

621
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,320
can do this just to let people know

622
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
what's wrong and what they can do to fix

623
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,200
it that's incredible i mean

624
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
i don't want to i don't want to say that

625
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,600
like this should be an entire branch

626
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,400
of

627
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
a non-military military but i kind of

628
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,559
feel like it should be like people that

629
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,880
are dedicated to just fixing

630
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,520
all of the issues on the internet

631
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,600
now why is this a good thing

632
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,440
if i go back to what we kind of talked

633
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,799
about before

634
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,919
when you understand the offensive piece

635
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,640
of anything whether it's cyber security

636
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,320
or information technology or bomb making

637
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,880
you inherently begin to understand what

638
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,360
to look for what indicators to look for

639
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,840
if you want to try to defend it

640
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
hire all the hackers the hackers know

641
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,559
the hackers are in on this

642
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,279
now everybody as as these kind of press

643
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,720
releases have been coming out that are

644
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,440
talking about this everybody says well

645
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,039
the government is never going to really

646
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,760
hire hackers right because we don't fit

647
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,240
the standards of you know the

648
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
model government employee we aren't

649
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
going to cut our hair and our tattoos

650
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,279
are all going to be out and maybe you

651
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,480
know

652
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,640
we smoke weed

653
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,200
so what so what

654
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,039
the entire change and shift and how dhs

655
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
and the government is actually going to

656
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,840
be able to address threats in the future

657
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,640
threats like log4j is by getting those

658
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,200
people involved and i have a crazy crazy

659
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
idea for this i have a crazy massive

660
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,960
rebuild the government but subtly

661
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,799
idea for this

662
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,600
let's talk about it

663
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,320
so this is only a couple of the items

664
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,279
but we're already seeing sisa really

665
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,000
start to do several of these which is

666
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,919
magnificent

667
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,520
number one

668
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
normalize the breach

669
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,120
you are going to get breached something

670
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,720
that i've been very

671
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,039
excited to see with log4j are the

672
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,799
ongoing calls with dhs at jen easterly

673
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,840
is on the nkick leader is on all of the

674
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,279
people that you want to talk to to get

675
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,080
data from is on the call to actually

676
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,320
talk you through and answer questions

677
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,120
these calls go on for two hours

678
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,440
i've seen one go for three hours

679
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,600
being able to reach out to the community

680
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,520
and say it's okay everybody's dealing

681
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
with this

682
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,799
that needs to be the new norm okay

683
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,279
you're going to get breached everyone is

684
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,600
going to get breached that is the nature

685
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,960
of the beast that we are currently

686
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,760
fighting so if we say normalize the

687
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,400
breach then we can get rid of this blame

688
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
game that we're all playing with each

689
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,559
other

690
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,279
the lawyers trying to blame the security

691
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,520
researcher that brought it up and

692
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,440
the government trying to blame the

693
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,279
company and say you weren't ready for

694
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,880
this and you should have done this this

695
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,159
this and this

696
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,000
and then you know of course the company

697
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,840
trying to blame literally everybody else

698
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
so that they don't have to pay fines

699
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,799
the the system is broken it doesn't work

700
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,679
it is all about blame shift and nothing

701
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,080
about collaboration and that absolutely

702
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,159
has to change if we're going to make a

703
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,799
difference in the coming two years

704
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,520
so

705
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,919
cesa really and i know they're working

706
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,960
on this if partially is this whole idea

707
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,880
of a clearinghouse where all breaches

708
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,120
are reported kind of to this one central

709
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,679
thing but where this gets difficult is

710
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
that it can't truly be a government-only

711
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,120
agency it has to be

712
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,679
bits and pieces of government

713
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,159
private industry um you know and the

714
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,799
public sector that are all invested in

715
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,799
it and that all have authority in it and

716
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,440
this is something that you know hasn't

717
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,919
really been done to the extent that i'm

718
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,240
kind of hoping that it could be

719
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
um you know utilizing the sector

720
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,320
specific agencies the the regulation

721
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
agencies one of the biggest complaints

722
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,120
um that i heard uh when the first

723
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,879
infrastruc sorry the first um

724
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,760
incident reporting uh bill came out or

725
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,399
was put on the floor was that you know

726
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,559
are we supposed to report to all of the

727
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,159
regulatory agencies that we have to

728
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,480
report to do we have to report to you

729
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
know the the nuclear regulatory

730
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,840
commission and the ftc and and and and

731
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,880
and then cesa and then fbi that has been

732
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,600
a massive problem and companies still

733
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
don't know the answer to that even

734
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,039
though there has been guidance put out

735
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,840
recently that says you need to reach out

736
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,799
to your reporting agency and then they

737
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,440
will let us know okay well what happens

738
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,279
if they don't let you know and you come

739
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,120
back and say hey what were you doing

740
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,960
these are valid questions these are

741
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,799
things that need to be hashed out in a

742
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,279
new kind of collaborative style uh with

743
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,960
working for the government or working

744
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,480
with the government

745
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
uh the csa program needs to be

746
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,200
repurposed so that and that's um

747
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,399
cyber security uh uh kind of uh

748
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,120
protectors and directors that are out in

749
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,960
the community that are meant to be there

750
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
so that uh anybody any organization any

751
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,600
um piece of critical infrastructure can

752
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,279
come to them and ask them questions and

753
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,520
they can be guided directly to the

754
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,840
source that is required at dhs it needs

755
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,960
to be kind of

756
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,000
judged up a little bit yes i said judged

757
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,279
um the ice axe empowering them with more

758
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,600
uh responsibility and allowing them to

759
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,880
really have the teeth to be able to make

760
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,399
change when it comes to collaboration

761
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,080
and information sharing we need more

762
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,159
carrots we gotta have more carrots we

763
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,960
have so many sticks and the sticks are

764
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,600
making us thrive in the blame game we

765
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,120
gotta get rid of some of the sticks and

766
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,760
i am the first person who will say

767
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,320
i love regulation

768
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
i do uh regulation has done so many

769
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,559
great things for us regulation has given

770
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,000
us driver's license and roads that have

771
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,600
like street signs that you have to pay

772
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,200
attention to and it's given us aviation

773
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,880
regulation where

774
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,799
we're comfortable knowing that we're not

775
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,200
going to fall out of the sky right

776
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,360
regulation is not a bad thing but

777
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,760
regulation has to be it absolutely has

778
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,720
to be supported with all the carrots as

779
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,440
many carrots as you can give otherwise

780
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,320
why why would you want to cooperate with

781
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
the big stick organization who's going

782
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
to sue you and take money from you

783
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,200
i wouldn't

784
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,120
widely understood system of data sharing

785
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,919
and collaboration and this is no easy

786
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,000
feat it's absolutely not an easy feat

787
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,679
it's difficult and we've been talking

788
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,000
about it for 30 years

789
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,520
probably longer

790
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
i just wasn't alive back then

791
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,880
but

792
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
we have to get better at this and that's

793
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,799
where i think this sort of joint

794
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,679
clearinghouse that involves everybody

795
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,679
and that the buy-in from everybody is

796
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,760
the same that's how we're going to start

797
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
to get into this that's the

798
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,320
my

799
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,279
my

800
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,960
first ever public private government

801
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,360
joint ruled agency

802
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
it's gonna be crazy um

803
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,039
i'll tell you more about it

804
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,360
when i finish writing it but i want your

805
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,120
thoughts i want to talk to you about it

806
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,039
i want to talk to everybody about it

807
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,960
this isn't just my issue going back to

808
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,279
the very beginning of this when i said

809
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,080
everybody you have the power you have

810
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,320
the authority you have the ability to

811
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,960
help guide legislation especially in

812
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,000
cyber security where everybody is just

813
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
trying to grab their piece of the pie

814
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,480
right now how about we all get involved

815
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,360
and start telling them what is actually

816
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,080
required what is actually needed and

817
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,919
thinking out of the box thinking out of

818
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,360
the world thinking

819
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,440
in totally different ways if you could

820
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,240
change the process for uh incident

821
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
reporting if you could change the

822
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,960
process for

823
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,440
you know how funding is delivered to

824
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,519
critical infrastructure entities if you

825
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,320
could

826
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
find the best way to communicate with

827
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,080
dhs or fbi

828
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,159
on cyber security issues what would it

829
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,120
look like

830
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,760
what would you do

831
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,600
let's figure it out

832
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,000
cso has done an absolutely amazing job

833
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,720
this year absolutely amazing but as

834
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,000
we've seen as the litany of threats

835
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,720
continued through the year and now up to
