live from historic claymont delaware

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,439
this is my first con presentation

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,719
let's make it a brilliant one

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,120
how does beginning the cyber security

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,840
the perennial book and a lot of times

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,399
people answer blue team

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,760
red team purple theme pen pester

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,360
analysts auditors things like that

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,160
what's not talked about a lot is the

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,039
marketing side of cyber security which

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,000
is how

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,280
i entered the industry with my mba and

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,879
my writing skills

17
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,280
now marketing is really

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,920
interesting because you can use it as a

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
side door to get into cyber security

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
or you can build a whole career on the

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,960
side of the house and hopefully going to

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
get you started in doing either one of

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
those things

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,640
sony

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,119
dan is just a simple cyber security

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,880
copywriter

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,360
i love your my presentation is full of

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,680
these pop culture references because i

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
love them

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
now everybody watching this even if

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,079
they're brand new to the security

32
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,439
industry

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,200
you're familiar with things like

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,840
pentesters soc

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,600
but most people

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
in my experience have absolutely no idea

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,040
what a cyber security copywriter does i

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,680
have spent six years being asked over

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
and over

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,399
well what is it that you do anyway

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,479
well also my presentation is going to go

42
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,719
over

43
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,960
but first before i get into what a

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,360
psycho security experience i just have

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,160
to explain what's a copywriter and i

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,280
think

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,959
a lot of people have no idea what this

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,480
is they think it has something to do

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,720
with moving it along

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,959
now

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
later right the copywriting is business

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
writing opposed to writing you know

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
scripts or fiction or novels things like

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,720
that

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,239
okay

56
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,640
for the definition clear compelling

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,360
lobby for the purpose of self-control

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,319
or educating and engaging audiences

59
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
well look there though even when you're

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
educating and engaging you're still

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,480
selling it you're just doing

62
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,280
a soft self that's like a blog a good

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,239
blog

64
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,440
they kind of

65
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
softly celebrate educating people as to

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,519
you know what you would use of class

67
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,879
now

68
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
everything you read

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,560
on the web

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,360
somebody wrote that now you might write

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
your own blogs your own social media

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,959
posts

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,519
and things like that or even your own i

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,480
wrote my own concept here

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,280
a busy executive or an organization

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
they they don't do that they don't they

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,640
don't like their own stuff they don't

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,040
have time for that they might

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
be writers

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,239
that's what i've been doing for years

81
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,640
i've been a general journalist copy

82
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,560
later a lot longer than i've been a

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,319
cyber security copywriter

84
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,840
it's really important to point out

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
a couple of things here really i know

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
the deadline says copyrighting is more

87
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,480
than just selling and grammar

88
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
more than just writing i could find

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
papers except for papers like we were

90
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
talking about pre-showing

91
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,720
demographics

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,519
just because you have an english degree

93
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,720
that doesn't mean you're a copywriter

94
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,480
a million academic communicators

95
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,958
because

96
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,479
it really is like that okay you need to

97
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,800
explain this to me

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,320
in the elevator between the third and

99
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,639
fourth floor well i'm out of here a lot

100
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,080
of time for this

101
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,240
so you have to be concise you have to

102
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,880
get your point apart

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,880
you have to be persuasive

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
you also have to know something about

105
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,039
business

106
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,160
there's a lot

107
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,199
of

108
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,560
other mbas or words for me

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,639
i think because i have the understanding

110
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
you have to be a business person not

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
just a good danian

112
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,759
copyrighting

113
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,960
is also

114
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,039
more than just writing all day

115
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,240
lessons

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,880
about this we wrote this article a

117
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
couple years ago this person

118
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,919
cohortly like symbols

119
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,800
a day

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
every single day um

121
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
no that's not how this works that's not

122
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,759
my money and this works i mean

123
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,600
the hanging out entire season of the

124
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
walking dead and like the week because

125
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,960
we never beat

126
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,000
papers are put together in teams

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,400
blockbuster put together in teams you're

128
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
working with the rest of the marketing

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
team with the head of content with the

130
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,199
cmo chief marketing officer

131
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,120
you're making sure

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,039
that the marketing

133
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,840
and

134
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,000
communication strategies

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,479
according to a consistent message for

136
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,400
the organization

137
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
if you're running a company you don't

138
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,479
want your blocks to

139
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,759
sound really different than your social

140
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,400
media channel you want that tone to be

141
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,479
consistent around that's a big part of

142
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,720
copywriting so you're working with

143
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
project teams to make sure that the tone

144
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,600
is consistent to make sure that the

145
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,919
company is being presented

146
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,080
you make sure that the product that your

147
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,800
marketing product or products are being

148
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
marketed well because you want to hit on

149
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
the consumer's pain points you're

150
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,560
solving problems with the products

151
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,479
copywriters also do

152
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,800
especially for white papers tremendous

153
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,000
amounts of research

154
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,199
we we also sometimes and i did a lot in

155
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,960
2021

156
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
because i did a lot of client case

157
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,199
studies for cloudflare that's where you

158
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,479
interview

159
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,199
a company's client about a product let's

160
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,759
say a ddos product and you interview

161
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
them about well why did you implement

162
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,639
this file it who's were you having for

163
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,440
this god solve those problems uh what

164
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
else do you envision doing in the future

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
things like that so you talk to people

166
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,720
sometimes and then

167
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,919
when you're writing that interview

168
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,759
you don't just transcribe the interview

169
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
you're putting it into a story to tell

170
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,080
the brand's story

171
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
because anybody could just transcribe an

172
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,120
interview

173
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
but you're you're making it so people

174
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
actually want to read

175
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,440
it no

176
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
okay i started by saying it yeah i

177
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
started out as a generalist copyrighter

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,479
that's not a good thing

179
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,039
most successful copywriters specialize

180
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,400
in a particular niche uh

181
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,759
because there's a million drug companies

182
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,720
like i live in delaware

183
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,120
so i can't even specialize in cyber

184
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
security

185
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,039
laughing to another extent because i did

186
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,360
a lot of work for the google class

187
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,759
services company but especially cyber

188
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,000
security

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,039
as a cyber security copywriter i'm a

190
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,519
bridge between the technical and

191
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,399
business sides of infosec

192
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,399
if i'm writing a blog about something

193
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,360
let's say one for j

194
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
dude i have to understand what i'm

195
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
talking about

196
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,760
at least

197
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,880
level okay i'm not a developer

198
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,839
all

199
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,360
and that's the only way i can write

200
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,839
about it

201
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
because these thoughts are going out to

202
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
two audiences both technical and

203
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,839
non-technical and we don't want to look

204
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,080
forward in front of the non-attack of

205
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,320
the very technical people i have to have

206
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,720
an idea of what i'm talking about

207
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
anything

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,959
when i'm doing client studies i'm

209
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,360
interviewing with cso

210
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,160
from their company was having um

211
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,519
people

212
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,880
now has

213
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,760
secure and enable remote workforces

214
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
because of the pandemic

215
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
and i'm talking to them about zero trust

216
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,640
i interviewed a lot of people

217
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,200
but implementing zero front platforms

218
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
well i don't understand why is it that

219
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
you know you would want a zero plus

220
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,880
platform hey you can't just describe the

221
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,120
problem

222
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,519
somebody want to implement this what are

223
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,480
they getting at the this to them

224
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
so that's how i'll bridge the deck in

225
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
the business side because i can talk to

226
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,760
cso's language i can also call the ceo's

227
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,319
language

228
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,079
now

229
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,959
the next question may be well

230
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,959
isn't this the same thing aesthetically

231
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
no okay these are two different

232
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,279
functions

233
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,440
very simply

234
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,240
writers market problems technical

235
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,959
leaders teach people how to use them so

236
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,200
technical leaders do not get involved in

237
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
the marketing side at all

238
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,160
people have already purchased the

239
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,839
product and to need something to

240
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
configure it being successful

241
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,399
analyst on monday where i'm going to be

242
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,360
using

243
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,279
my writing skills

244
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,120
to write reports and they're going to

245
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,440
have to go through the company's

246
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,399
documentation as well

247
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,800
marketing professional you need to be

248
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,399
like really

249
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,959
to be a football security

250
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,920
you have to be at least in tackle

251
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,920
mode

252
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,920
you know

253
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,079
well what can you

254
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,560
as a cyber security copywriter

255
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,680
okay

256
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
that's how i began my career in interest

257
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,480
well you know i mentioned i start a new

258
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,120
job as an analyst on monday it's a good

259
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
time to talk about potential career

260
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,639
paths

261
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
if you want you could spend your whole

262
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,600
career in copywriter there's certainly a

263
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,839
lot of luke out there also kind of

264
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,040
people

265
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,800
i spent two years turning people away

266
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
and i still am i have to tell them that

267
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,279
i got a full-time job i can't take on

268
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
freelance work anymore

269
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,440
you could also

270
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,959
say another errands imagine you could be

271
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,000
you could wind up a content director at

272
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,720
a content problem

273
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
even a

274
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,399
marketing officer

275
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,360
that does not fear

276
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,240
because

277
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,399
my personal

278
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,320
depends on your personality interests

279
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,200
you can also feel this and in a little

280
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,160
bit there in the pre-show transitional

281
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,720
intensive areas of infosec

282
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,079
okay so

283
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:10,959
you know

284
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
what independence do you really contest

285
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,839
to run a vulnerability assessment you

286
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,920
should be able to

287
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,719
give to the claw

288
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,720
it's going to be a lot easier for you to

289
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
put together a report because i've seen

290
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,720
a lot of posts on twitter from one team

291
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,160
or something like oh my god i'm going to

292
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
write a report

293
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,760
and then just like that

294
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,079
just

295
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,399
is one of your competencies you're going

296
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,360
to have a lot ease a lot easier time

297
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,240
now

298
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,760
for being brca

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,720
things like okay if you're if your

300
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
company is going for the grant

301
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,560
certification and they want to do

302
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,920
bedramply and that means you can sell

303
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
services cloud services to the federal

304
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
government

305
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,800
like a top secret level you have to put

306
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
together what's called a system security

307
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,519
plan for documenting or documenting all

308
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
your security controls it could be

309
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,560
in the neighborhood of 2000 pages long

310
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,720
okay somebody's gonna write all that and

311
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,680
uh somebody like me

312
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,639
that's the reasons why

313
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,680
because it is writing heavy even though

314
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,639
the world says analysts

315
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,040
as a analyst

316
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
told you i made a lot of popcorn for

317
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,760
references and it's been a little

318
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,480
getting from there to here i'm not going

319
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
to torture you with that i cannot sing

320
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,279
at all

321
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,320
okay

322
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,360
my

323
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,839
journey into infosec was not a straight

324
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,279
line

325
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,240
not even close okay

326
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
potholes degrees

327
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,680
if this has been easy

328
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,800
i did not wake up one day and just say

329
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,639
what i want to do

330
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,760
is cyber security copywriter that's what

331
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,319
i'm gonna do

332
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
is a generalist copywriter in addictive

333
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,519
to doing

334
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,120
pretty much

335
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
why as long as you you know didn't

336
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,480
involve like killing people

337
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,959
just like

338
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,199
by going

339
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,959
pushing the bank and stuff off the page

340
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,040
on google

341
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
it's hilarious

342
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
and not getting me anywhere though

343
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,240
bunch of vacation because i graduated

344
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,480
my management in 2011.

345
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
had no idea how to leverage it

346
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,519
we

347
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,360
didn't take the same

348
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,600
resources that we have now this class

349
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
was pretty much an assistancy unless she

350
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,399
was for google

351
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,800
and know professional network to speak

352
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
um

353
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,880
a big people post which finds it really

354
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,000
hard to meet new people and networks

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
like the best people

356
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,719
people who paid

357
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,519
you know i didn't know what i was going

358
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,199
to do

359
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,720
the answer

360
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,199
was right in front of me at it and i

361
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,120
didn't know it you know i

362
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,119
mentioned it was still doing these work

363
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,520
jobs

364
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,439
like you know what it is mostly probably

365
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,640
it's a freelance platform they're the uh

366
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,599
probably the biggest one there

367
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,079
platform and me

368
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,400
you know doing different jobs on it not

369
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,640
just reputation management job but the

370
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,959
things like a little coffee what do you

371
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,400
see here in there

372
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
for example i wrote some coffee for a

373
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
company it's not even a business anymore

374
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,720
they may drone software

375
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,520
that ends up being my saving grace

376
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,600
so let's look how can we put on now

377
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,719
that's how i get possible

378
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,840
in

379
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,240
2016 i'm my very first investor client

380
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,160
and here's a problem

381
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
from

382
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,799
this company

383
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,919
that did

384
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,840
grc software development and auditing

385
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,720
check me out and said okay i i need some

386
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,919
content

387
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,160
for my company i i

388
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,679
need some sales

389
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,559
you know you have this uh this location

390
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,400
and i see you've done some temperatures

391
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
and you'd be good for this

392
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,200
if you don't know what grc it's not so

393
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,640
funny because

394
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,760
the newfound fight his author's job

395
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,000
had no idea what grc was here's what i

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,840
didn't know i really needed this money

397
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,200
and the client was willing to pay me

398
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,520
about twice as much as these other

399
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,000
so i said yes and then i served

400
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,960
furiously googly and i found out it

401
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,320
means

402
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,000
risk management complex

403
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,120
it was a grc that

404
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,000
gave myself a french education in it

405
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
because i had to this had to work that's

406
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
just failing

407
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,720
okay

408
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,880
and you can see here between 2016 and

409
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,520
2019 i worked very hard after i gave

410
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,559
myself this crash education

411
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,280
i

412
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,520
started blocking for this company every

413
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,440
week you know i started building a

414
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,799
portfolio

415
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
all of a sudden other companies started

416
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,919
finding one for a pr company that had

417
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,720
some cyber security fines

418
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
google cloud

419
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,799
without accident document brothers

420
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,480
security companies

421
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
flashlight

422
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,600
i started building a customer base

423
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,080
all of a sudden

424
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,960
people

425
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,160
coming at me and i just wanna

426
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
in 2019 i had my very first six-figure

427
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,039
year

428
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,919
so i went from foreclosure

429
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,039
to six figures i couldn't believe it

430
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,720
okay

431
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
2040 happened

432
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,400
and i thought that's gonna be the end of

433
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,280
this i figured this couldn't last

434
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,120
then everybody had

435
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,159
enabled secure remote workforces that's

436
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,320
my phone

437
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
you will still be working to the end of

438
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,559
the world

439
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,080
now we're in 2021 i decided that i

440
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,679
wanted to get out of freelance work and

441
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,840
get a full-time job and i also wanted to

442
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,840
transition into an analyst type

443
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,320
position i got offered three jobs

444
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,440
one of them

445
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,520
from the one i ended up taking was from

446
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,360
my current client uh keeper security uh

447
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,120
they didn't want to lose me

448
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,640
they just saw okay we have a great

449
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,280
writer and she knows cyber and she has

450
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,360
all this organizational knowledge they

451
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,039
didn't want it walking out the door

452
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,000
signed into discussions with them and i

453
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,840
start full time with him

454
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,440
one on monday as a grc analyst so for

455
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
global boss the grc analyst

456
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,880
i never thought this would happen and if

457
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,480
this happened to me

458
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
this could happen to you just trust me

459
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,360
here because i'm not even influenced

460
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
there's there's no time gonna spend the

461
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,080
whole day talking about this

462
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
enough about me

463
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
then you wrote ignores because you need

464
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
to get worse

465
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,840
the work is out there it's really out

466
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,760
there i talk about how i'm turning blind

467
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,840
36 of the american workforce freelances

468
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,960
now 53 provide skilled services like i

469
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,760
do

470
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,320
in fact the unskilled freelancers

471
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,440
percentage is going down and freelancing

472
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,039
freelancing is getting more and more

473
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,720
skilled

474
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,200
fell into this category for a long time

475
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
34 of freelancers told us

476
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,080
we earned more money freelancing

477
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,440
than we would have been a traditional

478
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,919
job this year and that was

479
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,360
my case for a long time will it receive

480
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,960
me off

481
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,120
they were paying me more than i i would

482
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,720
have learned in a full-time job at that

483
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,559
point especially because i was my folks

484
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,880
won i had no experience or anything and

485
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,880
cybersecurity

486
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
now i'm going to tell you

487
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,880
you need to start and go to yours

488
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,600
first you want to be a copywriter okay

489
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,919
this charity copywriter you need a

490
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,919
portfolio

491
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,120
you need to start a blog and you need to

492
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,280
update it regularly two or three times a

493
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,760
week at least if you're not working you

494
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,679
have to do this what else are you doing

495
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,480
like

496
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,080
medium uh that's a blogging platform one

497
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,679
of the reasons why i like it is their

498
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,400
articles tend to rank high in google so

499
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,919
somebody searches let's say you're

500
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,080
writing blogs about zero trust if

501
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,159
somebody searches zero trust your your

502
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,840
articles are probably gonna come up

503
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,640
pretty high if they're well written

504
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,600
you can write about cyber security news

505
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,840
you could write explainer articles just

506
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,400
start writing demonstrate you're not

507
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
college and as your knowledge base grows

508
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,960
you know keep lying

509
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,320
my media blog is uh i haven't updated a

510
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,880
long time i have a need so people been

511
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,320
coming at me and so this is so

512
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,320
useful

513

531
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,000
it's a good one i know there's always uh

533

here's some things i was going to get

537
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,520
into

538
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,960
because like i said i'm starting

539
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,360
because i want to keep promoting my

540
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,880
personal brand even though i've got a

541
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,279
full-time job because which is good for

542
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,080
anybody to do

543
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,640
network network network this

544
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,840
somebody

545
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,679
in the discord you know they were saying

546
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,360
i'm kind of shy it's hard for me to

547
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,880
network

548
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,720
i'm not so much shy but i'm just a

549
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,480
people person

550
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,679
you're not a networking person

551
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,080
so i know it's the beauty nobody has to

552
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,720
anymore unless you want to

553
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,279
get involved in sex twitter get involved

554
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,240

555
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,360

[Music]

558
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,240
but here's what you do use linkedin for

559
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,559
when you get a freelance job

560
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,799
connect with your clients on linkedin

561
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,880
and if you do work with them

562
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
with them because people in fact move

563
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
around a lot just so when they move from

564
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,600
one company to earthquake

565
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,520

570
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,919

580
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,120
sure what else to put it

581
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,159

582
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,000
english language copywriting because

583
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,679
unfortunately

584
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,679
i only speak english but if you're like

585
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,600
oh she's not over there if you know who

586
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,720
that is then you know

587
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,799
if you can write in more than one

588
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,600
language you can write your own ticket

589
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,159
i know the clock player hires uh

590
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,159
copywriters who can write

591
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,320
well in other languages to energy

592
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,679
clients

593
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,679
whose first lineup is not english or

594
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,120
multinational firm multinational

595
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,679
multinational client bases

596
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,399
you can speak to them to those audience

597
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,799
and their languages that's great

598
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,840
uh you can do case studies

599
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,520

languages and some

602
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,799

english

605
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
