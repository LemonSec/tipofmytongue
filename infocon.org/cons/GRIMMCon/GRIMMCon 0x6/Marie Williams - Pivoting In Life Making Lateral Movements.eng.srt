uh hi everybody my name is marie um

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,640
williams and uh

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,039
i'm happy that you're here today this is

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,800
my first time speaking at a conference

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,560
i'm like really nervous

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,279
so today i want to go over some topics

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,119
about pivoting and life and making

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,680
lateral movements in your career field

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,559
um

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,559
i want to share a little bit of my story

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,399
and maybe it could help you

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,280
uh as a mentor i could also help you

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,360
you know if you have a mentee

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,200
you could forward them this video in the

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,719
future um

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,399
we're all busy so

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,120
uh this video could help you know your

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
mentees out whenever

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,120
they need some help i need some

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,160
resources or have questions

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,840
i want to help fellow students as well

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,040
get some resources and help set them on

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
their path

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,479
a little bit about me i'm a cyber

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,720
security analyst at fit defender

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,439
i have my second second associates in

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,920
cyber security and i start my university

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
in january you can find me on twitter or

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,200
discord

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,200
so my purpose of my talk today is to

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,960
really convey that there's no right path

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
into cyber security everyone has their

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
own path and no path is for everyone

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,079
each path is unique

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,759
i want to provide some non-typical

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,000
guidance on how to join the industry

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,799
through non-traditional ways often there

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,320
are debates on whether or not you should

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
get a degree

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,680
what's right and wrong

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,600
but like i said there is no right path

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,559
in cyber security

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,119
so my intentions are to help bridge the

47
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,399
gap

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,759
to help those who don't have the

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,119
resources

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,520
i know i didn't

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
i kind of fell into this by

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,159
chance or accident

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,680
i want to help those who don't have

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
resources

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,800
and also help you bridge the gap of uh

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,879
that you might possibly possibly be

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,800
creating for yourself

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,440
it is in my spirit to help others um i

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
hope my mom's watching but my parents uh

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,959
helped people all their life so i

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,879
watched them my grandfather

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,959
also helped people he helped find

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,239
missing children

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,720
so um naturally i just want to help

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,440
people um and i didn't think that this

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,840
field even had that type of opportunity

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,400
and i'm glad to see people do that

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
so uh

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,080
i see industry leaders leading by

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,040
example and i want to help emulate those

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,480
i want to also emulate those great

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,920
leaders

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,160
my professors are helping the next

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,840
generation of students

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,160
become cyber security professionals

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,239
my cyber patriot coach

77
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,720
she was the one who

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,840
got the

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
cyber patriot

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,000
into the uh school district so she's

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,720
helping the students pave their way into

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
the cyber security field

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
uh my boss that bit defender and how

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
open-minded they are to people like me

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
who just say hey uh

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,599
how can i uh get into this field how can

87
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,800
i work for you

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
um they didn't have to do that uh

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,200
they're very open-minded as leaders and

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,720
that's pretty awesome and then people

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,519
that i've networked on twitter um

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,000
i see them leading by example

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
in many various ways through podcasts by

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,959
just cheering people on

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,799
by giving them

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,360
examples and resources and help

97
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,840
so uh

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,720
so there is no right path right you can

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
get your cyber security degree but you

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,799
don't have to you could pair that degree

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,879
with certifications

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,000
or you can just get certifications only

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,239
and there's a lot of

104
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,000
educational resources in the field out

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
there that are also very affordable

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,680
uh tcm security likes to give do

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,239
giveaways um hack the box academy is

108
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,319
pretty affordable as well i knew hacked

109
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,840
the box existed but i didn't know the

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,879
academy existed until i really started

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,238
getting into

112
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,758
networking with people

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
so given uh the fact that we are here at

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,680
grim con

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,520
graham com

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,919
also provides grim also provides

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,880
training

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,199
um so if you're already in the field

119
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,560
uh you're and you're a security

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,400
professional they provide hands-on

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,759
training for professionals

122
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,400
so what does pivoting mean right so

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,560
i love this quote pivot in life it may

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,639
just be your silver lining

125
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,000
um

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,320
pivoting can mean a lot of things so i

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,479
will touch briefly on what it means in

128
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,840
pin testing

129
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
some of us may know and some of us may

130
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,639
not

131
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
i'll briefly touch on the definition and

132
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
how it applies to my life and what i

133
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,039
have done

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,320
and what others have done

135
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
so pivoting and lateral movements and

136
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,479
pin testing you have your threat after

137
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,639
he starts studying his target

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,600
um he sends a phishing email

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,360
uh he ends up ends up making the

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,280
connection

141
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,160
then he goes into the servers and

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,280
systems

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
starts scrubbing the passwords and

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,039
starts you know he runs away with his

145
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,160
profit or

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,360
uh

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,039
things that he he was looking for

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,880
so pivoting in my life

149
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,520
um i've made several lateral movements

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,280
um and pivoted in my most recent fail

151
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
we all have setbacks in our life whether

152
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
that's great or small and we learn from

153
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
them and get better with time

154
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,400
i've had many setbacks in life and i've

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
lost a lot of time but i persevered

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
um i won't go too much into my his my

157
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
far back into my history i'll just

158
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,360
talk about my uh most recent

159
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,479
fail

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,960
um so i was in the military briefly i

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,919
got a an associates in degree associates

162
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,319
in computer and electronics

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,520
thinking that i was going to go back

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,199
into the military and then i decided not

165
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
to

166
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
i thought programming was hacking so i

167
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,160
did sign up to go to get my

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,720
programming degree after this first

169
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,680
degree

170
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,919
and um i realized it wasn't there

171
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,759
weren't any cyber security degrees out

172
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,639
there i really didn't know how to get

173
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,479
into learning about hacking i didn't

174
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,880
know how to get to the tools or anything

175
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
like that i didn't even do my research

176
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,720
um

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,440
so i dropped out of programming um fell

178
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,759
into some really deep uh

179
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
dark times and then i ended up working

180
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,240
in the food industry for the best chefs

181
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
um that ended up not being conducive to

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
my life so i went back to tech um

183
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
i first went to a coding boot camp

184
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
um i remember on her first day i said

185
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
that i want i was interested in coding

186
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
and cyber security

187
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,160
but i didn't think that my cyber

188
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,639
security path was going to be so soon

189
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,680
so

190
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,160
i went to the boot camp i could not keep

191
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,560
up i i was burning out it was way too

192
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,919
fast-paced for me so kudos to those who

193
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,919
go through boot camps and finish because

194
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,960
i couldn't

195
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,360
um i failed and um

196
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
then i was like you know i was leaving

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,840
the uh hacker space i was standing at it

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,960
was like

199
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,520
late later than what most people do like

200
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,400
study

201
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,280
for uh and i passed by bitdefender and i

202
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,880
was like oh that's cool i used to be a

203
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
customer of theirs i didn't think that

204
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
they were here um i'm going to go in and

205
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,440
ask them some questions like

206
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,080
how can i work there i ask them uh do i

207
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,639
need a degree to get into this field

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,120
what certifications do you think i

209
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
i should get i was like i was thinking

210
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,319
about ceh

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,879
so on and so forth uh they gave me some

212
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,800
advice they even said i didn't need a

213
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,319
degree

214
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
which is pretty awesome um

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,639
which is why i'm conveying this is

216
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,000
because like you could just get your

217
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
certifications to get into the field

218
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,199
um

219
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,680
and then i got a business card from them

220
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
so i said i'll see you in a year

221
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,639
so i left and then two weeks later i

222
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,240
sent it for school

223
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
and then i talked to somebody from the

224
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
boot camp again and i said hey guess

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
what i signed up for school he's like

226
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,199
well that's awesome that you're able to

227
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,160
pivot and continue on and i was like wow

228
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,599
that's the first time i ever heard that

229
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,560
word

230
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
i literally never i heard of pivoting in

231
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
the military but like i never heard of

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
that

233
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,320
for my life right so i thought that was

234
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
pretty cool that he said that i carried

235
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,440
that with me

236
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,919
um and then as i continue on with school

237
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,399
i got on udemy and coursera

238
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,800
and learn more about myself because i

239
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,360
can code i'm just better self-taught i'm

240
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,160
better

241
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,720
watching videos um i'm better reading

242
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,360
and comprehension and applying

243
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,640
versus very very fast-paced um so i was

244
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,519
learning

245
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,920
i react in angular on the side and then

246
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,000
continuing on with school

247
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,959
so uh i fell into

248
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,959
volunteering

249
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,440
with b-sides and because my school

250
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,240
wanted me to and um

251
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
i found cyber patriot through my

252
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,040
school's website

253
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,959
um i usually volunteer for food banks

254
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,040
and i was like you know what i want to

255
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
volunteer for my field which makes sense

256
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,399
right

257
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,160
so uh i really want to convey that

258
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
volunteering in your field helps you

259
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
pivot and make loud those lateral

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
movements if you want to get into the

261
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,279
cyber security field because you end up

262
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,279
networking with a lot of people

263
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,600
um and these are great people i'm very

264
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
surprised like everyone's just very

265
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,080
helpful super helpful super nice and

266
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
like really knowledgeable

267
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,880
um so i started doing that

268
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,279
and then

269
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,519
i learned about chai hackme me

270
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
hex box academy which i didn't know

271
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
existed

272
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
i knew hacked the box assisted but not

273
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
academy

274
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
um

275
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,880
and then you know i did my volunteering

276
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,600
i

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,720
met phillip and kim

278
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,279
kim crowley is an awesome person

279
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,959
the first time i talked to her literally

280
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,880
was about elon musk

281
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,360
um and the reason why i trust her

282
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
as anybody in the field or mentor is

283
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,079
because

284
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
she she won't steer you the wrong way

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,480
and she'll tell you like it is and if

286
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,079
you don't know something she'll tell you

287
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,399
and she'll give you the resources to

288
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
learn about that subject

289
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
and philip wylie i think he's awesome he

290
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,399
he helps

291
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,040
keep people secure in the industry um i

292
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
feel like he does a little bit of ocean

293
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
maybe he did some on me but uh it was

294
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
pretty awesome because he helped me pave

295
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,000
my own path uh get some resources

296
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
out there and i rested i read their pen

297
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,560
testers blue book um that's an awesome

298
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,440
book

299
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
to you know for beginners to like pave

300
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
their own path get into the

301
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,320
industry figure out what they want to do

302
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
so on and so forth

303
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,560
um i kept networking on twitter which is

304
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
weird because i fell into twitter

305
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,360
through my honor society um and how they

306
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
play games on twitter so they play games

307
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,279
on twitter then i fell into cyber

308
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,360
security twitter and

309
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,839
it all went on from there so uh

310
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,560
through networking i made friends and

311
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,480
got a free defcon badge

312
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,640
uh this year which is pretty awesome

313
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
i didn't know black hat had scholarships

314
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,320
i was like i'm probably not going to get

315
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,360
one but i'll do it anyways and i did and

316
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,120
i got a scholarship so

317
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,040
it was pretty awesome i didn't think i

318
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,959
was ever going to go to black hat like i

319
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
wanted to go years ago and i was like

320
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
i'm not going to go

321
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,839
um i didn't think i was going to go to

322
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,000
black hat this soon um

323
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,399
and i did and it was pretty awesome so i

324
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,240
think it's pretty

325
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
awesome to make these connections in the

326
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,360
industry

327
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
um again i had i didn't have my degree

328
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,079
at the time you don't have to have your

329
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,040
degree

330
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,839
to make these connections and um

331
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,079
reap from these benefits

332
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,440
um so a year into my schooling i moved

333
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
and i misplaced my bitdefender business

334
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,320
card

335
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
and i was on an rsa virtual conference

336
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
because

337
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
i'm always constantly learning i see a

338
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,360
conference i'm like okay let me sign up

339
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
i might not go to it if i don't have

340
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
time but like at least i signed up for

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,279
it um so i went to the rsa conference

342
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
and i saw somebody

343
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,519
um who works at the defender who i

344
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,959
happen to be following

345
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,279
and i was like well he's pretty

346
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,600
he's a pretty high leader like will he

347
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
write me back

348
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,880
i wrote to him anyways and i took that

349
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,839
chance and he wrote me back and i told

350
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,680
him the story about how i said i was

351
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,160
going to come back in a year

352
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,720
um he did not have to talk to me he did

353
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
not have to write back he could have

354
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
just been like look this noob i don't

355
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,120
care what she has to say uh but he got

356
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,600
uh the email the most important email

357
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,959
that i needed

358
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,920
um to send in my resume in half an hour

359
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
so that's another good reason why

360
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,440
networking in the industry is good

361
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,399
because

362
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,079
everyone's just really here to help you

363
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,920
out and connect you to people

364
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,440
so i

365
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,480
connected with um who i needed to

366
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,880
uh we made our discussion and i got my

367
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
internship so

368
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,360
um

369
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,600
i think it's pretty awesome um do you

370
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
need a degree no uh

371
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,040
but on my path i feel like i needed a

372
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
degree because it helps keep me

373
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,839
accountable

374
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,959
uh it has gives me doors to leadership

375
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,040
and then helps me uh

376
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
smooth out the rough edges on my soft

377
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,480
skills

378
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,440
um

379
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
so now i share my story with others i

380
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,120
have a fellow mentee in the cyberpatriot

381
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,880
um group that i'm in and she is going to

382
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,279
a university and she's really young and

383
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,440
she doesn't know any of you guys she

384
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
doesn't know any of you guys she doesn't

385
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
know any of you guys exist

386
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,279
or women in cyber security so i'm

387
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,480
helping her

388
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,240
get those connections and i'm hoping

389
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,160
that she takes the advice that i give

390
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,959
her

391
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,120
um

392
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,279
so

393
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,639
this leads me to my next um how others

394
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,800
in the industry have pivoted

395
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,839
uh

396
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,600
they all have had their own goals made

397
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,880
some career changes got their

398
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,279
certifications or found their niche

399
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,920
um again you carve your own path right

400
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,519
just like as these people that i'm about

401
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,800
to show you have

402
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,519
uh don't ever let anyone yourself or

403
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,760
your own setbacks discourage you

404
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
from getting into the fields

405
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,959
uh your path is not wrong um whichever

406
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,560
path you choose to take

407
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,160
so i'm going to go ahead and briefly

408
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,920
touch on

409
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,199
these others in the industry

410
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,399
so lily clark i happen to uh have met

411
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,320
her at defcon she's a really awesome

412
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
girl

413
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,839
she's really nice i met her on twitter

414
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,720
which is really funny because

415
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,000
i think it's an awkward way to meet

416
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
somebody right but

417
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,040
she was really nice she gave me the time

418
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
of day and um i watched her grow very

419
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,399
rapidly within this year

420
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,720
um it's pretty awesome uh to where she

421
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
has pivoted on to um

422
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,560
and i think that uh i think that

423
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
networking with people and her attitude

424
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,760
helps out a lot um

425
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
she's a really great person

426
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
she has her health degree um as you can

427
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,720
see here she pivoted through many

428
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,880
different job sectors

429
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,560
she ended up getting her eg pt

430
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,040
certification um

431
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800
she has a mentor

432
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,519
john helmness who she trusts the most i

433
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,880
think that

434
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,959
when you're in this field you need a

435
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,839
mentor i think mentorship is um

436
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,839
is very important to help guide you

437
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,959
along the way

438
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,279
um and now she's an offensive security

439
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,680
consultant for echelon so

440
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,800
pretty awesome for her um i think that

441
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
we need more people like her in the

442
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
industry

443
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,440
so casey i met him

444
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
in my uh twitter networking path like

445
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,320
when we only had like 100 followers

446
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
he is perfect example of not having a

447
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,199
degree in cyber security he just has a

448
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,920
ccna certification and he most recently

449
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,680
got his cyber security job offer

450
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,160
sciatic nerd

451
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,079
uh he's pretty awesome i met him through

452
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,759
b-sides which is

453
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,600
it's great because now i'm staffer

454
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
b-sides next year so

455
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,000
uh he's also another example of how he

456
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
got into cyber security without getting

457
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,399
a degree in cyber security

458
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,000
he

459
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,160
got his degree in photography

460
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
then he decided to get his ms degree and

461
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,360
then added assist to that and now is in

462
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
digital management

463
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,519
mike patrick he's a very inspiring

464
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,440
person i think he's very good he's a

465
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,920
very good person uh when i was creating

466
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,079
the slide like towards the end i was

467
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,399
like teary-eyed because i was like oh my

468
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,800
god i like read the notes that he sent

469
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,160
me and i was like

470
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
okay so he started his pool business and

471
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,839
he had to pull business for almost a

472
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,959
decade

473
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,120
um he was tired of it he really wanted

474
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,920
to

475
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,000
uh change careers for his family which i

476
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
think is really touching

477
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,560
um

478
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,079
very awesome of you

479
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,120
uh

480
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,959
he went on to get a cyber security

481
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,199
degree to help balance his life out he

482
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,599
got his certifications his mentor is joe

483
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,160
hell from tcm security

484
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
and he found him found his uh first cve

485
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,400
this year and now he's tester so

486
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
all this happened

487
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
within this year

488
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
and i think it's i commend him because

489
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,199
he has a family

490
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,359
he changed careers i mean he did all

491
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,360
that studying i mean i don't have a

492
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,799
certification yet i've been studying for

493
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,400
two straight years

494
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
and he got those two certifications and

495
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,640
a cve and i i think it's pretty awesome

496
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,880
did a cyber security degree get that for

497
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,440
him not necessarily the fact that he

498
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,840
paired it with his certifications did

499
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,520
um and the fact that he he has his

500
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,480
mentor

501
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,559
and um you know good guide i've heard

502
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,360
really uh great things about joe hell um

503
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,600
and uh mike really just kept at it

504
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
um and the next one is melanie mitch

505
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,160
she's the perfect example of how she

506
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,360
persevered

507
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,280
through

508
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,840
some life traumas or you know things

509
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,360
that people go through

510
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,320
but i really like her because

511
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,679
she got her pntp certification

512
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,080
through that like through persevering

513
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,480
through her her hardship

514
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,520
um

515
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,559
hardships actually um i've been studying

516
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,720
for two straight years i fell into my

517
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,120
dark times and i'm still

518
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,000
due to earn my own certifications so i

519
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,039
think it's pretty awesome that she

520
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
persevered through it all and she got

521
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,520
her pntp certification as you can see

522
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,039
she does not have her degree in cyber

523
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,919
security she did a lot of networking her

524
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,280
mentors heath adams and um now she's

525
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,679
well she's starting as an ocean analyst

526
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,120
next year so

527
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,440
uh clap uh let's clap for her because

528
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,240
that's pretty awesome

529
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,520
so i'll go

530
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,200
my next few slides are resources and

531
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,480
mentors i'll briefly go through them

532
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,280

533
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
these two are awesome as i've talked

534
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,120

535
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,960
about them if you don't please forward

536
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,000
them to

537
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,080
new students people on the field that

538
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,400
don't know about them yet uh they're

539
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,720
pretty great people to have on your side

540
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
uh felipe and omar i made them my

541
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,520
mentors uh

542
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,080
not even sure phillip philippe thinks

543
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,320
thinks he's my mentor but i can come to

544
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
them and ask them questions anytime i

545
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,200
want and they'll help me out in fact mr

546
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
just recently sent me

547
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,799
books so that i can study for my

548
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,280
security plus 601 certification since i

549
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,400
only studied for the 501

550
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,120
i really admire their posts on twitter i

551
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,799
really admire their talks they're very

552
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,840
technical

553
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
and one day i hope to be just like them

554
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,039
because

555
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,640
i don't always want to be giving talks

556
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,559
like this one egg i hope i can show you

557
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,919
a tool

558
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,320
um that someone created or that i found

559
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,439

563
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,440
they tell awesome stories

564
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,600

565
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,880
also

566
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,080
davin

567
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,240
is a security researcher or security

568
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
engineer and he is also a perfect

569
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
example of how you don't need your cyber

570
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,960
security degree to get into the field he

571
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,240
only has certifications

572
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,960
and these are other

573
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,320
resources and mentors they mentor people

574
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,600
out in the industry

575
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,400
all their information is right here

576
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,880
i know i'm going to be crunched on time

577
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,960
so i'll just lightly touch on them

578
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
lola's awesome she's been rapidly

579

the field she's an awesome woman

581
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,080
um i really commend her drive she only

582
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,679
learned to try hack me

583
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,679
and then she got her ejpt through iron

584
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,440
and now she's working for i so she's

585
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,280
another great example of how you don't

586
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,760
have to have a cyber security degree to

587
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
get into the field

588

uh

623
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,000

625
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,960
degree again

626
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,080
um there's no right path in the field

627
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,880
um

628
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,280

631
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,480
and the rest here are also great

632
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,520
resources and mentors i have not touched

633
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,240
and

634
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,039
have not used their resources

635
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,400
at all i've looked into them and people

636
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,080
are very happy with them

637
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,440
i

638
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,480
as you can see here

639
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,799
they're all wonderful people and i

640
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,480
really appreciate the fact that they let

641
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
me put

642
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,480
put them down as a resource uh this

643
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,400
women in cyber security i just recently

644
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,679
joined them and i haven't touched base

645
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,200
with them very much

646
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,640

647
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
purple is uh

648
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,039
very good for application security um

649
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,840
she's really into diversity and bridging

650
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
the diversity gap in cyber security so i

651
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
think that's pretty awesome as well if

652
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,720
you want to learn

653
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,679

pretty awesome i haven't seen that in

670
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,679
the industry well this year

671
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,960
