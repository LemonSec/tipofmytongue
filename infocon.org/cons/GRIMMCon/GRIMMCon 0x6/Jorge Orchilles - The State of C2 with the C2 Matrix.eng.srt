everyone's on discord i can actually

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,080
multitask i teach uh for sam so i can

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,039
like look down and see you all talking

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,599
so uh let's just start out by saying hey

9

located

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,120
if uh if your opsec allows who's coming

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,079
from the furthest place

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,680
anyone from another country any

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,840
europeans out there

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,640
oh

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,280
look i see a few of you some some names

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
i recognize costa rica

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,360
australia i think australia won

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,280
california fantastic

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,600
awesome awesome awesome so yeah the

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,680
reason i uh mentioned discord is that

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,920
you can ask questions as i'm speaking to

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,640
you and i may see it and answer it

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
immediately or

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,000
if you uh are looking into the future i

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,159
might just have another slide that will

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,320
cover that so um

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,439
definitely

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,720
post that um any questions there and

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,439
a whole team

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,520
that's required to put a virtual

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
conference together so shout out to all

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,240
of them um and all the folks at grimm

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,600
that are making this happen all the

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,119
volunteers etc so appreciate that uh

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,439
i do not have all the creds uh of our

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,880
keynote speaker

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,840
uh but i do have some experience in the

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,159
commercial space um

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,320
i'm the chief technology office officer

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,680
already messing up

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,399
uh i'm the cto at scythe whatever that

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,119
stands for um and one of the co-creators

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,960
of the c2 matrix which is what we're

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,159
gonna cover

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,280
uh

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,239
here and i've done a few things i love

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,560
giving back to the community so speaking

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
at conferences especially free

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
conferences is awesome um

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
some of the things we've done is the

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
release the purple team exercise

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
framework that we will actually be going

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,239
through in our workshop later today so

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,000
um if you want to learn about purple

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
teaming and do some command and control

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
do some adversary emulation and then

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,440
detect it

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
with through detection engineering uh we

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
have a couple of psych folks uh

67
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,239
running through that chris peacock who

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,200
is our resident detective engineer and

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
elaine who runs support at site are all

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,519
gonna be there uh doing that so that's

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,640
at one

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
we'll cover some of that um prior to

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
psych i ran the offensive team at

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,480
citigroup so everything from

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,640
vulnerability assessment to pen testing

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,879
to red teaming that's kind of where i

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,519
really got into c2 stuff

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,720
um

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
also a sand certified instructor and

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,760
author of a red team course there

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840
and a contributor to

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
some things you might have heard or seen

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,440
like mitre attack atomic red team cvss

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,159
version 3 and 3.1

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
and the google global financial markets

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,640
association built a framework there for

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,720
regulatory compliance so

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,480
that's a little bit about me feel free

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,560
to uh follow me there on twitter or

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
connect on linkedin i do uh love talking

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
to everyone and see how things are

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,560
evolving

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
and that's essentially what we're going

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,920
to talk about today is command and

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,879
control and how it has evolved

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,360
now for anyone uh that has not used or

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
knows what c2 is i'll give a little

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,319
intro just to bring everyone up to speed

99
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,280
uh some of you may have used c2 before

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,760
uh but essentially c2 stands for command

101
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
and control it's uh the ability to

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,400
communicate with a an asset in

103
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,799
a particular system in the cyber

104
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,360
security world uh generally you take

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
over a system you execute code in there

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
and you have to communicate with that

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,238
system to tell it what you want to do

108
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,440
um so by law i'm required to show at

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,918
least something about miter attack so

110
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,919
the miner attack tactics are here on the

111
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,680
top um

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
they have grown significantly but the

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,199
big one is command and control one of my

114
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
favorite ones um

115
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
and the thing about command and control

116
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,000
is that we all use this uh as johnny

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,560
said right before the talk is this is

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
important for red teamers blue teamers

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,479
really anyone needs to understand how

120
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,880
this happens uh because without

121
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,520
communication you don't have any control

122
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,160
which means you would have to build a

123
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
worm now do any of you recall

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,720
any recent worms that we've seen out

125
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
there

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
uh we can go back all the way to the

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,160
morris worm back in the 80s don't expect

128
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,440
many to uh recall that one but there

129
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
have been a lot since probably the newer

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
ones are things like not petya

131
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,919
and wannacry

132
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,120
and

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
um

134
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
stuxnet right all those

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
um

136
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
got out of control

137
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,919
right they were all they've all gone out

138
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,080
of control because there was no

139
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,039
um central c2 for them

140
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,960
and essentially they all got out and

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
that's how we know about them but other

142
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,400
than those most attacks have

143
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,199
some sort of communication channel again

144
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
this is taking over a system

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,120
and being able to uh communicate with so

146
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
our focus here is going to be on command

147
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
control frameworks but commanding

148
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,440
control as a channel is very simple over

149
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,240
on the left we have a target system they

150
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,639
might have gotten a phishing email they

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,360
were compromised some way somehow right

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
initial access is a matter of time

153
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,120
uh many many ways of doing that but once

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,800
you gain initial access you execute code

155
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
and

156
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,039
you

157
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,199
establish communication to your command

158
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
and control server which is over here on

159
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
the right this actually empire uh quick

160
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
question here on the expert track

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
channel do

162
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,120
any of you have experience have you

163
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
played with any c2s and so which ones

164
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
have you played with any c2s and if so

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,919
which ones uh and i see that uh message

166
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,840
going back to energy drinks with code

167
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
red yes code red was also a worm also

168
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
got out of control

169
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,479
um

170
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,160
cs which uh stands for cobalt strike

171
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
not crowd strike and covenant cool cool

172
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,080
cool

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,479
some at work and on my own so someone

174
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,880
developed something oh there we go

175
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,880
empire mythic posh

176
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,120
mostly from the rto course yeah

177
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,840
duct tape command and control never seen

178
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,319
that one that's an interesting one

179
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,639
um so yeah over here on the right you

180
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,599
can see um a year ago we hosted a the

181
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,319
user conference at site called unicon

182
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,319
because we love unicorns i don't know if

183
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,560
you've seen these guys they sell

184
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,759
unicorns

185
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,759
um and one of the things we did was i

186
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,840
capture the flag called know your

187
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,639
payload and our theory was a lot of

188
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,880
people know how to build payloads but

189
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
might not know everything that actually

190
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
happens in the background so

191
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,680
built a couple payloads put up a bunch

192
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,360
of c2 servers um in particular it was a

193
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,039
posh an empire and a site server

194
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,199
and we gave these payloads and i thought

195
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,800
are people actually going to run these

196
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,879
payloads in their environment and if you

197
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,280
look very closely we actually had 457

198
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,080
uh

199
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,120
payloads execu and connecting to this c2

200
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
server we had put up on digital ocean uh

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,840
it's the most i've seen on on empire

202
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,199
um they have a whole bunch of agents

203
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,479
connected so

204
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,879
um that's c2 it seems most of you all

205
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,759
know how c2 works so that's great we

206
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,160
will just continue on

207
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,280
um

208
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
where did c2 matrix come from all those

209
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,560
idea well back in july 2019 i was

210
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,440
writing um security 564 actually

211
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,599
rewriting it uh joe best was the

212
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,120
original uh author there i rewrote it

213
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,760
and i used empire um as the c2 we're

214
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
gonna use in the labs because for a two

215
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
day course you're going to teach someone

216
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,839
command and control and a lot of things

217
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,920
about red teaming you don't you can't

218
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,519
just spend the entire time on a c2

219
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,120
framework so we used empire as the main

220
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
c2 and it was mostly because it was the

221
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,320
most reliable and consistency too it

222
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,720
came out like in 2016

223
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,680
very

224
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,160
reliable and you need that in a class

225
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,920
environment i know john mentioned he

226
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,320
does some teaching and when you're

227
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
teaching a topic

228
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
and someone executes him follows the

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,440
direction you want to make sure

230
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
that it executes reliably and

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
consistently every time you don't want

232
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,600
to be troubleshooting a tool when you're

233
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
teaching a particular procedure a

234
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,360
particular ttp right so

235
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
back then empire was definitely the most

236
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,680
reliable and consistent built the class

237
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,240
around that turned the class in and then

238
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
july 31st occurs and

239
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,320
this happens uh

240
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,360
tweet from one of the maintainers of

241
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,320
um empire saying hey everyone knows and

242
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,560
knows how to detect power shell we're

243
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,040
not going to support uh empire anymore i

244
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,519
said all right cool so let's figure out

245
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,200
another c2 that we can use that's

246
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
actively maintained for the course i

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,279
started asking around

248
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,880
um

249
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,839
and i got a whole bunch of different ass

250
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,920
uh answers i actually went to sans

251
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
instructor chat

252
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
uh slack where you know ed scotus is on

253
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,200
there tim and dean john strand uh jeff

254
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
mcjunkin right ask all those folks hey

255
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,360
what c2 do you use and i got eight

256
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,800
different answers someone's like coming

257
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
in just like you all just did right oh

258
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,959
i've used covenant i've used a mythic or

259
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,040
i've used posh and mythic back then

260
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,240
wasn't really called mythic it was

261
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,600
called apfel uh etc

262
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,040
so

263
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,360
i'm like all right cool

264
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
let's figure out which one to use for my

265
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
class

266
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,360
then september uh right around derbycon

267
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,200
the last story become

268
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
rest in peace derbycon we will miss you

269
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
awesome awesome conference um had a

270
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
great time uh

271
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,800
remember

272
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,480
some parts of it thanks to a friend

273
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
carlos van germini who uh

274
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,600
took care of me after a few drinks um

275
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
before i broke my phone was was not a

276
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,920
good site but

277
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,160
i was there uh talking bryson and adam

278
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
machinshe about you know all these c2s

279
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,519
and which ones um they use and all that

280
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,760
and bryson was doing a talk uh where he

281
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
was trying to show caldera and if you

282
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
use caldera back in the day how there

283
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,079
was not very reliable or consistent

284
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,760
and we came up with this idea of just

285
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,720
you know why don't we evaluate these c2s

286
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,920
and track them so we started evaluating

287
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,800
these c2s and in november 2019 we

288
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,079
launched um the c2 matrix

289
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,680
and as any project goes you have to have

290
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,000
some goals because um you might get a

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,440
scope creep right so the goals were to

292
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,320
choose the best modern replacement for

293
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,040
empire one that's reliable consistent

294
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,360
user friendly and that meets the

295
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,760
requirements of a red team i was again

296
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,320
working at city at that time running the

297
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,880
red team there and we needed operational

298
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,240
security

299
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,600
right some encryption between a

300
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
system you compromised and your uh your

301
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
server

302
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,600
you needed multiple c2 channels so http

303
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,000
https dns etc

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,880
um

305
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,000
ability to build different payloads off

306
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,399
of your um

307
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,560
of your stagers so that you can execute

308
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
say in a microsoft word document or

309
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
execute the uh dlls and uh all these

310
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,200
other

311
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
low vast ways of executing right

312
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,000
and custom profiles you have to be able

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
to customize this because

314
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,240
a c2 is kind of obvious uh on the

315
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
network right especially when you use

316
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
some of these default profiles of

317
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,720
calling back like every five seconds or

318
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,279
every 10 seconds etc

319
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,480
um

320
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
so

321
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,600
other than that we wanted some other

322
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
things i worked at an enterprise

323
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,560
uh having a

324
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,279
proxy aware c2 was important many

325
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,160
enterprises have proxies going outbound

326
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,480
right you don't just allow access to the

327
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,639
internet in every way shape or form you

328
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,279
have to go through a proxy so

329
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,200
having a proxy aware payload was

330
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,440
important had to be able to pivot

331
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,519
internally because

332
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,320
c2 is only one tactic right of a minor

333
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
attack lateral movement is is generally

334
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,160
required and oh yeah we're running a red

335
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,279
team

336
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,440
there's no i in team so we needed a

337
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
multi-user c2 and of course something

338
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
that that was maintained so

339
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,480
we put together this evaluation lab

340
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
um essentially have windows and linux

341
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,399
servers as the attackers they were on

342
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,680
one side of a network uh all going

343
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,519
through a ppf sense uh firewall pfsense

344
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,920
is free easy to customize you can have

345
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
different segments you can send it um

346
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
and get like netflow data you can get

347
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,800
ids you can you get some visibility

348
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,880
there so all this i actually set up on

349
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,440
my laptop you don't need like extra

350
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
um

351
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,639
you don't need any extra hardware for

352
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,600
this you can do all this with vmware um

353
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,760
and then some victim systems a windows

354
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,800
one running wireshark running sysmon

355
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,920
linux system running tcp dom mac et

356
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,839
cetera and have some sort of visibility

357
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,600
to know what's actually happening

358
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,279
because we're gonna be downloading a

359
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,720
whole bunch of free stuff from the

360
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,959
internet and

361
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,959
do you trust everything you download

362
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,240
from the internet probably not right um

363
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
so we wanted visibility and see what's

364
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,839
really happening

365
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,760
um just looking here at some of the

366
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,240
questions um yes so empire python it was

367
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,720
python empire that was the original um

368
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
build of it so the server side was on

369
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,600
python and then it built

370
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,279
payloads in

371
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,480
powershell

372
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
um and that's why it came out as

373
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,839
powershell empire um it really was a

374
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,839
combination of a bunch of powershell

375
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,959
projects um all put together so the

376
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
authors like harm joy for instance was

377
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,880
one he has uh power supply and power

378
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
view and all those were all brought

379
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
together and empire and yes that's a

380
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
star wars reference um

381
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,440
do you want to note that empire today is

382
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,680
actually maintained uh by dc security so

383
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,079
they empire is alive and well it's now

384
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,360
only power shell um payloads now they do

385
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,240
have some c-sharp um and some other

386
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,839
payload types as well

387
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,000
um is atomic uh red team consider c2 no

388
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,079
atomic red team does not have command

389
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,720
and control atomic red team are atomic

390
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
tests tests that you grab

391
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,199
a

392
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,519
uh command and you execute it on a

393
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,480
particular system manually um it does

394
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,720
not have command and control

395
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,000
um let's see what other questions are

396
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,240
uh

397
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,360
[Music]

398
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,040
all right cool so

399
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
what features mattered and what were we

400
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,360
looking for well we want to know

401
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,639
where uh and how this server worked was

402
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,199
it a python server was the server-side

403
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,000
build

404
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,959
in

405
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,240
um

406
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,279
c-sharp and c etc

407
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,519
where were the stagers or the implants

408
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,680
built for so for example empire

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,320
originally was powershell implants now

410
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,560
we see a lot of c sharp

411
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,360
uh implants or stagers we wanted to see

412
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,440
the user interface if it was multi-user

413
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
that was very important

414
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,000
if it was a web

415
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,199
uh accessible if it was a gui if it was

416
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,759
a command line uh we actually added dark

417
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,279
mode as a joke but apparently a lot of

418
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,920
people care about dark mode um if

419
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,240
there's an api

420
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,920
and if we could build implants for

421
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,600
different operating systems because as a

422
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,040
red teamer you're gonna go attack um

423
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,199
you know window systems linux system mac

424
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,679
systems and depending on that you had to

425
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,439
choose your c2

426
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,559
and

427
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,079
communication channel this one was

428
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
pretty important all the different ways

429
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,039
of communicating um

430
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,240
with

431
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,400
your c2 and the typical one like 80

432
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,039
probably of the attacks we see today use

433
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,280
https right as a communication channel

434
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,360
http is generally allow outbound

435
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,840
everywhere sometimes it's through a

436
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,240
proxy um but that that's generally the

437
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
the most important one we see today

438
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
there's others there's tcp if you've

439
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,280
used metasploit right the reverse tcp

440
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,720
shells and all that

441
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
um

442
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,760
http 2 http 3 might not have visibility

443
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
in your organization they're newer

444
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,440
protocols as is dns over https some old

445
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
school ones etc

446
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,600
so all of this um was built in the

447
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,799
uh most used hacking tools so infosec

448
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,280
professionals as a whole use this one

449
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,160
particular tool more than anything else

450
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,600
um

451
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,919
it could be google sheets or microsoft

452
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,160
excel but essentially spreadsheets it's

453
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,679
the number one tool used by infosight

454
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,919
people i don't know if uh you all uh

455
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,880
spend a lot of time in excel or in uh or

456
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,120
in google sheets but you talk to other

457
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
people in the in the infosec industry

458
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,840
it's essentially the number one infosec

459
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,640
tool out there along with powerpoint um

460
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,520
so

461
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,760
you know those are the the top two um

462
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,039
so we built it like this as a way to to

463
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,360
see it um i'm gonna do a little demo of

464
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,559
that right now in a couple seconds um we

465
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,960
also launched a website to make this

466
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,039
prettier um

467
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,679
there's an ask the c2 matrix so you can

468
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
find out what c2 you wanted to use as

469
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,000
well as documentation so there's a how

470
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,360
to setting up these c2s there's a vm

471
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,160
there's a whole bunch of stuff um so let

472
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,360
me uh

473
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,120
go ahead and show that here real quick

474
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,799
pop open this uh c2 matrix

475
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,600
so here's the c2 matrix website the

476
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
matrix is the golden source it's a

477
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,919
google sheet page so if i click that and

478
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,600
load it up

479
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,120
um you can see the name of the c2

480
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,080
um so you can scroll down here and you

481
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
know we were talking about empire so

482
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
we'll use empire as a

483
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,039
as an example here it's a bsd3 license

484
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,840
meaning that you can use this right all

485
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,480
uh it's free there's no price there's a

486
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,919
github for it so you can access that um

487
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,039
there

488
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,960
here's a website by the way let me post

489
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
that over here on uh

490
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,600
on

491
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,679
our page

492
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,559
um

493
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,480
on discord so

494
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
you have the github where you can

495
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,559
download it the twitter if you want to

496
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,919
contact the the people that uh do it and

497
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,559
then who evaluated it and you could see

498
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,000
there's a whole bunch of people i have

499
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,039
evaluated uh c2s you can do this as well

500
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,280
i'll talk about contributions and all

501
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,000
that the version was three zero five

502
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,480
there's way later versions now

503
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,280
um there's a how-to for some of these so

504
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
you can actually click on this how-to

505
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,039
page and it tells you how to set up

506
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,679
empire some have videos some have

507
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,320
installs etc

508
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,360
um

509
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
it's available on the sans slingshot vm

510
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,400
and it's available on cali i actually

511
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
work with some of the folks uh offensive

512
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,159
security that released the kali um

513
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,480
distro so that you can get c2s on there

514
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,360
as well

515
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,120
and then here you can see the server the

516
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
server in this case was python and the

517
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,600
implants were created with powershell

518
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,919
it was multi-user with this thing called

519
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,159
starkiller

520
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,880
it has a gui it has dark mode it has an

521
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,919
api you can create implants for windows

522
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,360
linux and mac

523
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,760
communication uh mainly over http and

524
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,559
https

525
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,400
and then over here you see some of the

526
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,640
capabilities we looked at like the key

527
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,760
exchange so when you have a payload it

528
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
has a key hard-coded into it to

529
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,919
communicate with the c2 server for

530
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,679
operational security

531
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,840
um it doesn't allow for steganography

532
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
which is hiding things in images

533
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,320
is it proxy aware does that allow domain

534
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,480
fronting custom profiles

535
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,200
jitter working hours etc right so we've

536
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,320
been populating this um quite a bit

537
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,360
and

538
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,760
uh lots of things have changed so it's

539
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,919
kind of like the intro of the c2 matrix

540
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,960
if you've never um never seen this

541
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,000
before

542
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,360
um

543
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,400
so let me close out of this stuff and

544
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,640
get back on our presentation

545
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,600
um which is really the core of the talk

546
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,159
right is what has changed right what has

547
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,760
changed um since we started this project

548
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,039
well more c-tubes um back in november

549
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,320
2019 when this was released there was 30

550
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,559
c2s in the c2 matrix

551
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,440
last year in november 2020 uh there were

552
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,320
60 and this year around november i think

553
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,080
now we're up to 90.

554
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,880
88. so really big growth in uh c2s that

555
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,559
are available

556
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,400
um but

557
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,440
really

558
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,400
um

559
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,600
all of these

560
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
are not

561
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,280
c2s or c2 frameworks

562
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,320
so c2 is command and control a c2

563
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
framework is different than just command

564
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,960
and control a c2 framework is modular

565
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
allows you to build things in because

566
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,559
one thing's having the communication

567
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,280
channel the other thing is giving you

568
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,840
execution giving you the ability to do

569
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,640
lateral movement right all the features

570
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,200
that come in a c2 one thing is just

571
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,679
having a shell the other is having all

572
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,840
these different modules so we don't

573
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,400
currently distinguish between c2s and c2

574
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,440
frameworks they're just all listed there

575
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,240
um and then what we found out as well is

576
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,400
that writing a c2

577
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,159
does not equal maintaining ac2 so some

578
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,480
people will write a c2

579
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,320
put it on github

580
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
people use it

581
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,280
um and then it's never maintained

582
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,679
um so we've seen quite a bit of that but

583
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,600
again you can't complain about this

584
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,640
because you didn't pay for it right

585
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
um

586
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,240
so that that's become quite evident

587
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,200
we've added um is it actively maintained

588
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,960
and to be actively maintained it needs

589
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,880
to have been updated within the last

590
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,039
year so if it's been updated within the

591
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,880
last year we'll say it's actively

592
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,919
maintained

593
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,600
and of course there's a little debate

594
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,559
going on on twitter not sure if you all

595
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,279
are on twitter um or if you've been part

596
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,000
of this debate um and it's the offensive

597
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,679
security tool debate the ost debate um

598
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,799
essentially

599
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,679
one side of the

600
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,720
argument says that you shouldn't release

601
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,640
these tools for free because malicious

602
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,120
actors are using it while the other side

603
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
of the argument says do release this

604
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,360
tools because this is how

605
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
we learn and then we can defend better

606
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,279
so we're not going to go into that

607
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,120
debate it's been going on for a couple

608
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,679
years now uh but that's definitely still

609
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,159
going alive and well i see some of you

610
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,880
uh may have heard of it some you may not

611
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,520
but that's definitely has occurred

612
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
one of the cool things though that um i

613
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,919
want to give a shout out to and actually

614
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,720
uh hopefully get you all working on this

615
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,840
is sponsorwear so you have open source

616
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,200
stuff

617
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,520
that's built by developers and a lot of

618
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,919
times they build this on their free time

619
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,440
and then large organizations go and they

620
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,720
download these free open source tools

621
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,360
from github they look at the code they

622
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,600
use it and they get a bunch of value out

623
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,640
of them

624
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
and then something doesn't work and they

625
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,760
create a issue in uh github right they

626
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,159
don't create a pull request they create

627
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,120
an issue they say hey marcelo in this

628
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,760
example he's bite leader on uh twitter

629
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,600
um he has created a whole bunch of

630
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
awesome things um in particular and

631
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,640
related to this talk uh a c2 called

632
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,919
silent trinity though hey marcelo this

633
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,919
doesn't work man can you get this to

634
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,400
work come on come on come on it's like

635
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,200
marcelo's doing this for free you know

636
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
like

637
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,679
so he came out and he said look i'm

638
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,279
going to put some of these out as

639
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,679
sponsorware sponsor where it means that

640
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,400
you

641
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,520
can go on github or gitlab or a variety

642
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,679
of different um

643
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,240
platforms and essentially pay

644
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,320
them to support and there's different

645
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,720
ranges you can say hey you know i use a

646
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,559
lot of marcelo's tools my company should

647
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,960
probably pay him i don't know 300 a

648
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,880
month because we got a lot of value out

649
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,760
of this

650
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,640
um

651
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
or you can say you know i'm picking out

652
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,720
a pocket i can give him five bucks a

653
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,840
month right

654
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
and we've seen this kind of pick up on

655
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,919
the right here you see bc security did

656
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,120
this as well

657
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,919
and

658
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,159
um and a lot of others are kind of

659
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,120
starting to do that so we've seen that

660
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,679
growth uh for sure and not sure if you

661
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,919
all sponsor you contribute if you do

662
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,000
sponsor something what do you sponsor

663
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,880
let us know on get uh discord um

664
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,039
what what do you sponsor right

665
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,200
responders another one right not really

666
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,840
a c2 but definitely something a lot of

667
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,799
people have used in their enterprise and

668
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,880
probably did not help the developers

669
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,080
right so big fan of this model the other

670
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,360
model that we're seeing quite a bit is

671
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,520
commercialized c2s now full disclosure

672
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,200
i'm the cto at site we have uh we are on

673
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,880
this list so

674
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,760
uh do know that it was actually spun out

675
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,240
from grim so this is grim con so full

676
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,559
disclosure there before we we continue

677
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,960
on and talk about the commercial c2s but

678
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,279
this number has grown significantly it's

679
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,640
now 12

680
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,039
of the c2s on the c2 matrix are

681
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,880
commercial c2s

682
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,600
um some that we've seen are brute retell

683
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,919
this is by someone uh by dark vortex

684
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,399
also on twitter as paranoid ninja

685
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,840
created uh one of these uh cobalt strike

686
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,080
of course i think all of you have heard

687
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,520
of that um the big news since c2 matrix

688
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,039
started tracking all this is that they

689
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,279
were bought by help systems the makers

690
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,600
of core impact so we'll see what happens

691
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,840
there but joe vest is one of the folks

692
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,320
uh running now and working there uh

693
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,080
personal friends so

694
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,559
uh you you may have heard or used this

695
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,080
there's other companies that are like

696
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
consulting companies kind of like grim

697
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,960
uh creating site um

698
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,919
that

699
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,799
are doing this pivot labs phil haven

700
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,240
immunity has one called innuendo then

701
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,000
they were bought by

702
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,799
siteterra which was then spun out into

703
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,840
appgate etc um

704
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,240
nighthawk is is the new one in town this

705
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,640
one was just released this month um we

706
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,559
kind of knew this was coming these are

707
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,799
the folks from md set uh also a

708
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,039
consulting company out of the uk

709
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,679
um outflank another consulting company

710
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,480
and the netherlands um has a tool called

711
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,840
ost

712
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,120
uh that stands for offensive uh

713
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,360
or outflanked security tool

714
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,480
and

715
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,279
they have a stage one c2 then red code

716
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,679
labs has this one that i can't pronounce

717
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,399
um caldera the folks there

718
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,720
left and created one called

719
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,159
prelude

720
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,279
um

721
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,679
net spy another consulting company

722
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,120
bought renting toolkit uh scythe already

723
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,919
mentioned and then s2 security another

724
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,159
consulting company has one called voodoo

725
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,919
so essentially all these consulting

726
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,399
companies that do very

727
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,720
sophisticated and advanced red teaming

728
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,520
have built custom tools and then because

729
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,640
there's now a market to actually support

730
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,520
uh

731
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,559
a a c2 framework they are building this

732
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,279
up um over at the right a shout out to

733
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,559
elemental x2 um there was a little bit

734
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,399
of a twitter uh spat going on between

735
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,720
retell and nighthawk over which one was

736
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,039
better and then someone made a meme of

737
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,039
cobalt strike coming and bringing them

738
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,360
down and then someone put the c2 matrix

739
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,520
just running through them all because

740
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,159
you don't have to use just one c2 you

741
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,399
can actually use quite a bit so we'll

742
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,080
talk about that

743
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,039
um

744
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,960
a time check real quick uh just on the

745
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,880
expert track channel johnny uh what time

746
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,520
do i have to wrap up is that 12 30 or

747
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,000
someone just so i know i think i have 15

748
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,240
minutes but confirm that for me

749
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,840
so one of the things that we've seen is

750
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,159
specialization right in infosec you are

751
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,399
probably an example of specialization

752
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,279
right hands up if you were once the solo

753
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,399
security person in your organization at

754
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,760
one point

755
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,600
you were probably that um

756
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,960
so

757
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,799
if you were you've seen this uh kind of

758
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,960
evolve right now we have security

759
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,880
architects we have people that focus on

760
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,399
application security on network security

761
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,679
uh on security operations center

762
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,679
data uh digital forensics and instant

763
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,080
response cyber threat intel threat

764
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,760
hunting and offense right and office in

765
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,880
itself has changed when i started at

766
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,760
city like 12 years ago we were like six

767
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,240
or seven people doing everything offense

768
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,039
and then that um

769
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,159
started

770
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,919
you know spreading out we started doing

771
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,679
vulnerability assessment so running

772
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,600
vulnerability scans and then uh

773
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,440
prioritizing those vulnerabilities

774
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,520
validating them et cetera then pen

775
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,960
testing where you actually exploit

776
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,200
vulnerabilities and bug bounty where you

777
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,279
find vulnerabilities and vulnerability

778
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,039
research where you write all days kind

779
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,720
of like one of the things that grim does

780
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,360
right and then of course red teaming

781
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,919
which focuses on testing people process

782
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,840
and technology

783
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,919
and then within red teaming itself we

784
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,360
saw this evolve

785
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
my red team started i mentioned carlos

786
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,519
vendramini earlier on he is one of the

787
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,559
original red teamers uh over at city

788
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,600
still keep contact with him um

789
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,440
and

790
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,159
we went from hey we now have

791
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,159
you know seven or eight people on the

792
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,399
right team and while everyone kind of

793
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,240
knew how to do everything we started

794
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,720
specializing so we had developers

795
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,480
building custom

796
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,799
tooling and custom ways of custom

797
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,919
procedures custom tradecraft we had our

798
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,000
operators that were hands on keyboard

799
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,720
once initial access was obtained we had

800
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,640
people that specialized on initial

801
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,840
access and things like social

802
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
engineering oh carlos is on discord

803
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,840
there he goes he was one of the social

804
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,480
engineering uh folks way back when

805
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,120
um gaining access now i think his focus

806
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
is on cloud and whatnot but it was

807
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,039
really that specialization that allowed

808
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,760
us to be and show more value and really

809
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,320
where we've gone to now is that an

810
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,039
operator red team operator is not

811
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,720
necessarily a red team developer and tim

812
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,279
malcolm better uh who used to work over

813
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,600
at walmart and the red team there

814
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,200
when he wrote this blog post back in

815
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
2019 it's like three years ago if

816
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,919
anyone's keeping track of time nowadays

817
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,760
said the future of adversaries is

818
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,000
software development

819
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,960
and we're seeing that so one of the

820
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,640
things we're seeing is

821
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,279
training specialized in developing

822
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,919
command and control and implants here

823
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,240
are two these already passed but you can

824
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,080
keep your eye on them one was at eco

825
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,120
party

826
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,679
the premier latin american conference

827
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,480
it's like defcon of south america uh

828
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,600
it's in argentina uh there was a

829
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,159
workshop on that then uh

830
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,840
khan over in uh in europe did another

831
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,120
one uh shout out to joff and the wild

832
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,840
west hack folks and

833
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,080
they have a course called enterprise

834
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,320
attack emulation and c2 implant

835
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,799
development that one's coming up

836
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,279
and rasta mouse if uh someone actually

837
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,799
mentioned rfto on discord um

838
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,120
and this is

839
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,559
um a new course that uh that he put out

840
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,480
through zero point security so the same

841
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,159
c uh rto course um on c2 development and

842
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,960
c sharp so lots of specialization on

843
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,440
that uh and there i see kenny saying

844
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,919
operator is not the same as dev yes a

845
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,519
hundred percent we are seeing that right

846
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,480
and

847
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,799
attack infrastructure right those that

848
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,960
do attack infrastructure know how hard

849
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,120
this is this screenshot here is actually

850
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,880
taken from uh my friend mark smith uh he

851
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,279
runs out flank and um this actually is a

852
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,320
picture of red elk red elk is a red

853
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,279
teamers elastic instance um where you

854
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,320
can monitor all your red team um

855
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,399
infrastructure but you know just from

856
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,000
looking at this you can see over on the

857
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,800
right

858
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,159
you have multiple c2 servers in a single

859
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,639
red team operation and then you have a

860
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,800
bunch of redirectors

861
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,520
right and you use right up to track all

862
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
that and of course if you're doing blind

863
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
red teaming or stealth red teaming you

864
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,960
have a white cell or trusted agents uh

865
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
which is a more descriptive way of

866
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,879
calling them nowadays

867
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,520
and it's it's quite a bit right

868
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,679
so a lot of best practices we've learned

869
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,079
this year and i love some of the quotes

870
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,480
here uh hacking lz uh he is the cto at

871
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,119
it's justin uh elves over at trusted seg

872
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,719
i don't know what happened this time i

873
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,359
think uh cobalt strike had a

874
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,440
vulnerability or something and he wrote

875
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,400
it's 2021 don't expose those c servers

876
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,640
directly to the internet right use

877
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,599
redirectors and one of the most common

878
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,240
redirectors is domain fronting but

879
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,400
domain fronting is dead right it's

880
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,839
getting caught oh no never mind right

881
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,000
domain fronting's alive it actually

882
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,480
still works oh but microsoft might ban

883
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,720
your account yeah but it still works

884
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,920
right so uh domain fronting is it's

885
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,480
still one method it's a particular

886
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,920
technique under uh command and control

887
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,280
and now we're seeing serverless

888
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,000
functions being used for domain fronting

889
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,880
essentially using azure or lambda or

890
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,760
cloudflare worker cloud fair workers to

891
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,839
do your redirection from a purely

892
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,560
serverless uh method so there's a whole

893
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,720
bunch of this like that could be its own

894
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,520
talk um i post a lot about it at

895
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,520
howto.c2matrix.com

896
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,280
um other things we're seeing is

897
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,079
frameworks for c2s so in a particular

898
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,320
red team engagement you might actually

899
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,839
have not just multiple c2 servers but

900
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,119
multiple c2 frameworks running and these

901
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,400
folks out of argentina have this

902
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
framework called sutaka

903
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,680
that

904
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,960
uses the apis of the c2 so you can be in

905
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
one web app

906
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,880
and actually administer

907
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,079
your

908
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,280
implants from a variety of different c2s

909
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
all in that same window

910
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,839
uh so it's pretty cool very helpful from

911
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,000
a um

912
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,240
from a operations perspective

913
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,240
other sorry i'm going fast i see i have

914
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,640
like seven minutes left um other ones

915
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,680
that we see is abandoned this is to

916
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,400
build your uh your infrastructure

917
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,280
quickly because every

918
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,160
uh

919
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,040
exercise every red team you build

920
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,000
um

921
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,320
is

922
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,720
gonna have its own infrastructure so how

923
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,800
can you automate that build out of

924
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,680
buying domains doing redirectors having

925
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,200
visibility etc becomes a full-time job

926
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,760
um another cool one that i saw um is

927
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,640
havoc

928
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,440
this one uses aws and spins up um

929
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,119
using terraform your c2 so a lot of

930
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,599
focus on that as well so not only you

931
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,520
know the c2 side but all the

932
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,760
infrastructure required and why does it

933
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,680
require all of this because we're

934
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,920
getting better as an industry right

935
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,880
these c2s come out and we test them and

936
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,680
we see them and um

937
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,839
we improve making the red team's life

938
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,400
harder but if you make our life harder

939
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,960
that means we are improving

940
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,960
so um just based on the time here um

941
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,160
what's the road map we're going to

942
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,440
contin continue to evaluate the c2s we

943
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,720
want to map more to what the d2s can do

944
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,119
other than command and control what are

945
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,560
all these new features i see uh dom

946
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,839
uh just joined the discord there uh he's

947
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,680
one of the developers for nighthawk

948
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,520
which i mentioned earlier

949
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,200
awesome awesome stuff being built there

950
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,359
and really mapping to what you can do

951
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,960
afterwards right we're seeing a lot of

952
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,320
things like around edr events uh edr

953
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,320
evasion ndr evasion etc um so really

954
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,480
mapping that out and really lowering the

955
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,720
curve right like all of these tools or

956
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,960
at least most almost all of them right i

957
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,720
think 88 of them are free you can go on

958
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,240
github and test them so if anyone could

959
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,160
go on github and pull these down and

960
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,480
test them then you should too that's

961
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,640
really where we keep pushing for attack

962
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,880
detect and respond right you want to

963
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,359
attack yourself so that you can improve

964
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,760
your detection and be able to respond

965
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,440
before the impact actually happens

966
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,000
um with that said we have a new release

967
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,720
of the sand slingshot c2 matrix edition

968
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,599
so

969
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,640
this is a virtual machine that has

970
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,359
multiple c2s pre-installed

971
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,839
um the goal is to lower that learning

972
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,920
curve right if you've never set up or

973
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,400
never installed a c2 maybe you've never

974
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,320
used docker or something like that you

975
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,560
can get straight to testing comes with

976
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,359
covenant empire poetic merlin metasploit

977
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,560
mythic posh shadow silent trinity and

978
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,680
sliver already pre-installed you just

979
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,480
download the vm you uh run it in your

980
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,440
virtual machine and of course do not use

981
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,160
it for production testing this is

982
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,240
a lab environment

983
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,119
um

984
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,520
so with that please do get involved

985
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,920
contribute um literally you can just

986
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,880
ping us um like if you see a new c2 out

987
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,680
there that's not on the c2 matrix just

988
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,359
tag us tag c2 matrix tag me bryson or

989
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,400
adam

990
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,440
we have a feedback form um if there's

991
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,320
anything that's not accurate right c2s

992
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,560
change new features come out maybe we

993
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,960
said that a particular capability was

994
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,160
not an apartment c2 and now it is let us

995
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,520
know we do all this for free right so uh

996
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,240
uh definitely post those if you share a

997
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,800
blog post if you tested one of these c2s

998
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,200
right you just did a little how-to how

999
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,480
to run something let us know um and of

1000
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,920
course if you evaluate any c2 uh we

1001
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,839
would appreciate the whole line filled

1002
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,640

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,160

1006
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,920
mcs

1007

1008
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,400
excuse me

1009
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,599
i don't think you're going to have time

1010
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,960
for a whole lot of questions we might be

1011
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,760
able to get one uh in before the next

1012
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,000
speaker however if you want to answer

1013
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,359
questions in the discord you're more

1014
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,078
than welcome to

1015
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,599
yo dawg i heard you like c2 so we built

1016
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,880
a c2 that lets you c2 your c2s

1017
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,960
yeah that's what it feels like there's

1018
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,200
so many here

1019
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,520
is a college degree required for open

1020
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,160
source c2 no

1021
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,560
um some are some are getting more and

1022
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,040
more complex to install

1023
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
um so

1024
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,640
yeah that that's why we built the c2 the

1025
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,839
the slingshot um is because they do get

1026
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,280
a little tough to install and uh that is

1027
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,880
not necessarily required to be an

1028
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,359
operator so uh we put that out there

1029
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,160
you do need a degree to be uh considered

1030
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,480
to contribute to the repo though you're

1031
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,160
gonna be vetted right

1032
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,040
yeah

1033
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,920
yeah so actually if you are so that's a

1034
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,480
great question to contribute a c2 matrix

1035
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
what i generally ask people is to just

1036
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,359
share the entire line because the matrix

1037
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,040
a lot of people are on it at like any

1038
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,920
given time so i don't give right access

1039
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,000
to a lot of people um there's a few like

1040
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,079
if you contributed a few times and we

1041
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,240
get know you right but you know someone

1042
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,599
random coming off the internet that

1043
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,200
we've never met before

1044
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,440
does not get full right access to uh to

1045
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,839
the c2 matrix now

1046
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,078
why not

1047
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,640
i thought this was open i thought this

1048
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,920
was community

1049
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
