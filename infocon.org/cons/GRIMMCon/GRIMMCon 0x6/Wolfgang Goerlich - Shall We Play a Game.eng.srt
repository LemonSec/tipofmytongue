[Music]

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,480
[Music]

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
all right so um

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,960
this talk is shall we play a game my

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,439
name is uh is wolfgang gorlick

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,640
i'm an advisory cso for cisco secure

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
today before then i was a security

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,679
officer

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,079
i ran a couple of consulting companies

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,280
um i i did a uh apprenticeship program

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,280
for a while where we put a whole bunch

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
of cybersecurity people through through

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,520
the paces and got their careers started

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,280
and as a matter of fact

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,039
it was around the time doing that i mean

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,680
three four years ago now where i first

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,360
debuted this talk

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,120
and uh and i was like yeah you know

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,360
shall we play a game right like the the

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,680
quintessential war games

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
message right like the hacker one of the

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,920
first hacker movies that so many people

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,480
in my generation saw right where you got

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,799
like the modems and you're using the pay

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,680
phones and everything and uh and one of

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
the people was like you know that's it's

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
more edgy

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,400
than i'd expect from you wolf i'm like

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
edgy it's not edgy it's like shall we

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,799
shall we play the game like no no it's

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,560
really edgy like i i wouldn't think

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,119
you'd reference the the saw movies

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
and like the the saw movies they're like

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
yeah you know like do you want to play a

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,680
game

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,200
like what are you talking about i'm

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,759
talking about like a nice game of chess

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,320
like no no no we're like

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,560
tell me how much blood

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,479
will you give in order to survive

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,759
no

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,159
that's not it at all so

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,240
uh i do think that maybe millennials

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,159
roon ruined everything actually i think

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,680
more than that we need more like war

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
games and hacker movies like things that

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,560
are set in this time and not just reboot

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
to the matrix which is probably a whole

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,079
other conversation that we should really

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,680
have in discord

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,439
but uh what this topic is actually on is

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,399
a a idea a capability that i've been

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,159
doing for a very long time and it's

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,639
really been the crux of many of my

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,318
security programs back to when i was a

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
security officer in financial services

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
through a couple consulting firms

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,840
this idea of running security exercises

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
and so today i want to talk about how

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,319
and why to run security exercise how to

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,280
structure it um where to start if you

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,840
don't have ones and also i'm gonna end

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,599
up their time today

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
um talking about a maturity model okay

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
so if you've got something going on

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
where do you go next uh and if you're

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,599
just starting out how do you plot

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,840
a road map for doing security exercises

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
you know it's it kind of makes sense

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
right we all

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,760
have effectively two paths we're playing

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,680
when the chips are down we're really

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
playing the game of security now we're

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,440
doing the compliance things which are

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,840
incredibly important and needed um not

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
when we're doing the the operations

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,959
things which are again incredibly

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,280
important but when the chips are down

80
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
we've got two things going on we've got

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,480
the life cycle

82
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,000
of ir

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
and we got the life cycle of uh the

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
attacker and this is well known you know

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,959
we're gonna we're gonna do stuff in ir

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,319
we're gonna write a plan and i'm sure

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,920
it's a great plan i'm sure we haven't

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,159
handed it off to the junior analyst

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,599
we're gonna have some run books i'm sure

90
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,519
they're very accurate and have been

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,360
updated sometime

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,560
this century or at least this decade and

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
and then something's gonna happen we're

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,760
gonna identify the bad guys and we're

95
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,040
gonna crowd them and get them out of the

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
network meanwhile of course the

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
adversaries got their own sort of path

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
that they're taking from reconnaissance

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,799
and to breaking into the system to

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
achieving what their objectives are

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,239
fundamental problem of this of course is

102
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,879
the time delay now this is well known

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,239
it's been said for at least a decade

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,480
that takes months to years to detect

105
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
when an adversary is in our networks i

106
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,640
think the last figure i saw was around

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,200
six months i thought this is good six

108
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,959
months is bad but this is good it's much

109
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,879
better than it was i'm like it used to

110
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,519
be you know a year or more this is good

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,360
and then i was reading uh reading some

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
ransomware reports

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
and it occurred to me thanks to the

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
ransomware author uh the report author

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,560
by the way not the

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,279
ransomware code itself um that the

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,798
reason for that is

118
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,880
ransomware attacks are the majority of

119
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,240
attacks right now and of course they

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
want to be identified very quickly and

121
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,759
that's pulling that time frame down

122
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,520
so it takes months to detect we know

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,000
this it takes three months or more to

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
respond this isn't something we

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,800
ordinarily think about a talk about

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
why is that what happens there when

127
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,560
we're doing that response

128
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,479
i can tell you just from

129
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
conversations in the past couple months

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
what happens when you're doing that

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,240
response uh csos uh i'm talking to you

132
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
friends and peers cecil's want to

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
micromanage right the boards yelling at

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
us are the ceo's yelling at us i'm going

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,759
to get in there and i'm going to make

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,280
sure no you really shouldn't step away

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
from the keyboard trust me

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
trust me i know it feels good but we

139
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,639
need to step back so there's

140
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,120
micromanaging going on um there's lack

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
of coordination going we don't know what

142
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,479
the plan is paul the run book oh my

143
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,080
goodness this says we're running

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
semantic we haven't run semantics since

145
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,240
2015. i'm sure the run book has been

146
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,400
updated recently

147
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,560
but it probably hasn't

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,199
what else happens well this one was a

149
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,880
conversation i was just having

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
a couple weeks ago

151
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,880
where they're responding to an event and

152
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,320
they reload the entire environment

153
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
that's awesome they reload the entire

154
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
environment with the same vulnerable

155
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,680
version of software that they're running

156
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,039
that allowed the

157
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,520
attacker to get in the first place

158
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
that happens a number of things go wrong

159
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,759
because we don't necessarily have the

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,840
muscle built up to to necessarily go

161
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,400
ahead and eradicate so three months is

162
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
the the median figure there

163
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,320
meanwhile on the on the um

164
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,319
attacker side it's much different now

165
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,440
these numbers can vary uh

166
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
i was talking to a ciso a couple months

167
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,759
ago and he was telling me of an incident

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,400
that was literally minutes right they

169
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
uh did this attack that's very common

170
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,759
right now if you don't have thresholding

171
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
in your multi-factor they just kept

172
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
pushing a request and pushing a request

173
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
to someone to finally they accepted it

174
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
once that happened they got in their

175
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,680
email they threw up all the email rules

176
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,960
uh to

177
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,319
effectively backdoor uh outlook and then

178
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,160
sent in all the phishing emails and and

179
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
head shell in the environment in minutes

180
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,960
so obviously these numbers are averages

181
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,199
uh but reconnaissance it depends on how

182
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,960
long you're taking maybe a few months

183
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,639
depending on how you're scoping out in

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,319
the environment

185
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,639
initial breach a couple days escalating

186
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,639
privileges a couple days

187
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
hours usually moving laterally

188
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,840
and then depending on what the uh

189
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,479
objective is could be a couple minutes

190
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,199
after that or could be weeks after that

191
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,280
so if you line up this up with the the

192
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
you know time-based security right the

193
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
classic the time-based security

194
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
uh model

195
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,880
where we say security is where

196
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
prevention is time is greater than

197
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
detection plus recovery if you line all

198
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,599
that up it's pretty clear that we're in

199
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,479
a bad spot and we've been in a bad spot

200
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,639
for a very long time now we know this um

201
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,120
this is not news but there's so many

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,599
different ways to tackle this uh do we

203
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
add more people to it well maybe we've

204
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
got a town charger we don't um do we buy

205
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
more technology well maybe we got

206
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,160
budgeted we don't do we use a technology

207
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,759
that we have better well

208
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,560
probably should because most of the time

209
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
in my experience our security products

210
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
are maybe half used half the features

211
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,560
are enabled right they're not

212
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,880
necessarily widely deployed

213
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,039
but it really brings up a good argument

214
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,199
about what needs to happen

215
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,039
do we need more tech

216
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,720
do we need better processes do we need

217
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,319
more people

218
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,759
and so what i would argue what i'm

219
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,199
arguing in this talk and what i'm

220
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
presenting as a method in this talk

221
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,759
is what we really need to do is get

222
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,240
better at

223
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,639
formally exercising

224
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,199
those steps in ir

225
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,360
and formerly making sure that the

226
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,759
controls are enabled in our operational

227
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,759
and are working are there when we need

228
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,240
them and building up that muscle memory

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
well that's what i think we need to do

230
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
in order to get better at uh containing

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
and eradicating the adversary so what

232
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,759
does that look like where do we start if

233
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,440
we're gonna do that

234
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
well it fundamentally begins with a

235
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,199
story

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,719
you know the uh

237
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,880
the native american phrase

238
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,919
um is those who tell stories

239
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,599
uh rule the world

240
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,360
or at least rule the sock i think that

241
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,599
may be my version of it um those who

242
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,160
tell stories rule the sock that sounds

243
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
good

244
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,680
what where does a good story begin with

245
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,839
well it begins with a couple of things

246
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,120
certainly

247
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
breach of the week

248
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,120
if you and your team

249
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,760
have not done a threat model

250
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,480
um and possibly a tabletop

251
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,240
on log4j and say the last month

252
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
maybe maybe you should or at least do it

253
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,560
do that right now this is not a good

254
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
time but let's say

255
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,480
in the beginning of january that would

256
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
be a good time so whatever is in the

257
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,519
news is of course a a good example it's

258
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,360
a salient example

259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,920
especially if it's at something

260
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
in an organization like ours right and

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,519
one of our peers um pen tests is is also

262
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,360
a good one hey a pen tester got in this

263
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
way this is what they did

264
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
let's talk through that and let's uh

265
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,440
let's go ahead and build out some

266
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,279
security exercises that way

267
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,160
um threat intelligence your ice acts

268
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
uh are a great one here's what's

269
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,040
happening

270
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,000
in

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
financial companies

272
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
just like ours here's what that looks

273
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,880
like we want to build out a

274
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,640
threat model and security exercise

275
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,240
around that

276
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
and of course we need to create a nice

277
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
clean feedback loop right if it happens

278
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,519
an instant response it probably should

279
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,760
be codified captured turned into an

280
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
exercise and repeated so the next time

281
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
that there's a fire we're not just

282
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,399
putting the fire with the other fire the

283
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,640
next time that there's a fire we're like

284
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,279
ah i remember this a few months ago we

285
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,839
went through this drill

286
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
so there's some good sources for these

287
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
stories now everyone's got a story right

288
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,920
everyone's got a way of saying this and

289
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,800
and there's some risks to these stories

290
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,760
so what what makes a good story the good

291
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
foundation for a security exercise i'd

292
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,560
argue it has three three things

293
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,360
it has a heart it's interesting it's

294
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
funny right there's a hero to that story

295
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,399
um and and it's the type of story that

296
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,519
makes you

297
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,760
want to hear it and makes you want to

298
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,320
tell it and that telling and retelling

299
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
is also a critical part of security

300
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,760
culture a little bit outside of this

301
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,519
conversation but if you've got good

302
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,800
stories that spread through your

303
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
organization oh

304
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,880
fantastic for security awareness much

305
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,040
better than please click through this

306
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,160
14

307
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,480
uh minute powerpoint and answer these

308
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,600
questions that you're going to brute

309
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,240
force english so it has a heart right it

310
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,040
has a heart uh it has a head it has some

311
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
facts we're not just saying oh yes

312
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
there's there's this really interesting

313
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,680
story that happened one day uh no we're

314
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
saying also did you know that um

315
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
this particular type of attack comprised

316
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,079
uh 37 of the attacks that were in the

317
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,640
verizon data breach report data set uh

318
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,399
for 2020 and so by adding a couple steps

319
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,880
we can circumvent that and oh by the way

320
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
again in that verizon data breach report

321
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,399
they found that if we increased it from

322
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,320
15 steps

323
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,600
or more

324
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,360
that the success that attack dropped in

325
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,320
half

326
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
it has a head it has some facts behind

327
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,079
it and then it has a point right all

328
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,320
right so now you capture the person's uh

329
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
attention hopefully they're enjoying the

330
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,519
story hopefully they're going to tell it

331
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,320
again

332
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
now you've stacked it up with some facts

333
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
it's grounded in reality and now you

334
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,079
have the ask here's what we want to do

335
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,600
we want you to enable this we want you

336
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
to change this we want you to join our

337
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
next drill that's what makes for a good

338
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
story

339
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
what makes for a bad story invariably is

340
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,560
fud

341
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
right those those are not the good

342
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,800
stories i've seen organizations have

343
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,320
attempted this

344
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,680
and uh

345
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,279
and it's

346
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,399
those

347
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,639
stories that go something like this

348
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,519
um there will be blood right this is

349
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,480
this is going to be terrible if this

350
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
happens the business will end and our

351
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
customers will never trust us again and

352
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,320
my god our stock money will market uh

353
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,639
valuation will fall through the floor

354
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,519
and people will will switch from owning

355
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,600
our stocks to buying bitcoin no no one

356
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,200
cares don't do that doesn't work

357
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
um and uh and they may get attention

358
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
initially but it's not backed by

359
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,800
facts and of course that's that's not

360
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,880
very reliable

361
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,200
it's need to be grounded in reality uh

362
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
one one

363
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
example

364
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,519
that i can give you is we did a security

365
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,519
exercise with the city uh when i was

366
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,760
running a red team a few years ago and

367
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,360
uh and we asked for and i thought this

368
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
was very reasonable

369
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,959
if i was johnny christmas i would have

370
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,399
gotten this approved

371
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
we asked for a grappling hook i thought

372
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
that was a reasonable request

373
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
if you're trying to break into a city

374
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
you would need a grappling hook

375
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,560
especially if you're anyway that was

376
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,120
apparently not backed up by any factual

377
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
data we couldn't demonstrate how often

378
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,680
times criminals are using these types of

379
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,440
uh these types of techniques so it has

380
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,079
to be grounded in reality

381
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,839
now when you're telling these stories

382
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,600
you're going to get some pushback and

383
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,279
that's not a bad thing

384
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,760
you can actually use the objections that

385
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,519
you get when you're telling these

386
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,079
stories as teachable moments

387
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,959
in one scenario i was i was doing a

388
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,639
early version of this with some

389
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,320
storytelling and talking through the

390
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,279
tactics and sort of level setting with a

391
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,880
security team the director was at the

392
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,160
head of the table

393
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,120
really smart lady her team was all in um

394
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,959
but you can tell she wasn't into it i

395
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,680
was referencing dave kennedy's uh talk

396
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
at the time i think it was a def con

397
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,079
talk uh if it may be a black hat someone

398
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,000
wants to correct me that's fine uh but

399
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,079
that he had shown how to like compromise

400
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,920
all the systems at once with system

401
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,880
center awesome talking he hits the

402
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
button he's got the lighter going and

403
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
all the shelves are pop so i was talking

404
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,880
through that and she's got her arms

405
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
crossed and she's pushing back from the

406
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
table

407
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
and finally she looks and she goes this

408
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,639
is all fine and good but no one's going

409
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,160
to know that we've got a system center

410
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
project going on

411
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
i'm like oh

412
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,880
yeah you're right no no one probably

413
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,360
would know that no no no

414
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
i'm like you know so the way you might

415
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,839
know that is the listeners common sense

416
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,959
uh or osn the way osn generally starts

417
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,800
until i'm on the projector so i throw

418
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,120
open a uh you know a browser and open up

419
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,560
google and so the way that

420
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
reconnaissance normally starts with some

421
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
google doors right some searches and so

422
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,880
maybe if someone searched with like your

423
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,279
company name and system center and so

424
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,959
you know i started walking through that

425
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,199
and and of course there's a job posting

426
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,720
for an engineer for system center um as

427
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,560
they were ramping up the system center

428
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
project they're trying to staff up uh

429
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
there are some you know help desk posts

430
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,399
and some forums

431
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,160
uh hey how does this work how does that

432
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,959
work

433
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,600
with the you know uh company's email

434
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
address um like i said when i do that

435
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
but the best one was the best one was so

436
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
remind you she was completely checked

437
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
out at this point the best one was

438
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
they had done a case study with

439
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,440
microsoft on system center

440
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,160
and so we catch at that point she puts

441
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,199
her hands with us pulls forward and

442
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,279
looks her dudes go see see this is why

443
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,360
we need to pay attention everyone now i

444
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
just want to demonstrate how easy it is

445
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,680
wolf please take us to the next steps it

446
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,720
was perfect so those objections those

447
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
objections themselves

448
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,199
are teachable moments

449
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,279
all right so now we've got a story

450
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,279
but now we need to know what the tactics

451
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,240
are

452
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,279
and for the longest time the tactics the

453
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,440
ttps were really what kept me up at

454
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,240
night right 10 years ago 15 years ago

455
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,720
building out exercises like this was

456
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,959
really the the ttps that were very

457
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,480
difficult for me to get my handle around

458
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
there's a lot of confusion around it

459
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,600
everyone had their own names for things

460
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,079
there wasn't a lot of commonality um

461
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,759
thankfully a lot of that is as

462
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,680
straightened out

463
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
so let's talk through how how we get

464
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,560
there

465
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,079
we start with that story

466
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,759
we do a tabletop

467
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,079
we build out the scenario right we got

468
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,440
the attack live cycle what does that

469
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
look like well for a data loss breach

470
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,959
here's how the attacker might move

471
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,199
through the network for going from

472
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,279
phishing to compromised data

473
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,639
here's what that might look like high

474
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,000
level

475
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,079
now behind the scenes for each one of

476
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,759
those labels we really want to get

477
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,839
specific tactics

478
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,519
that an adversary might execute

479
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,039
thankfully thankfully what's really been

480
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,039
a game changer in my opinion has been

481
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,559
the mitre attack framework in the past

482
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,799
few years which has really allowed us to

483
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,400
have a common set of language around

484
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,679
these tactics have a ability to delve

485
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,599
into what you can do to prevent detect

486
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,480
it

487
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,599
have uh have ability to get good data on

488
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,480
what's

489
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
regularly happening and whatnot

490
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,919
and then you use

491
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,480
as talked about earlier in in this track

492
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,120
right security's most used tool excel

493
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
there's probably a better way to do this

494
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
but i'd throw an excel

495
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
table lay out the stage layout the

496
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,080
tactics and have some descriptions

497
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,320
and that would break that story out into

498
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,000
a really good model and then we could

499
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,320
back that model up with some data again

500
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,960
how common are these tactics being

501
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
exploited who is exploiting them are

502
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,880
those threat actors threat actors that

503
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
are targeting our industry are those

504
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,559
threat actors that would want what we

505
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,760
have

506
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
and so on

507
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,160
from there one thing i want to caution

508
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,039
against

509
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,039
is is being too specific so i mentioned

510
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,520
system center and the system center

511
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,799
scenario

512
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,840
was really appropriate for an

513
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,360
organization that was going through a

514
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,840
system center implementation project

515
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,200
perfect spot on very timely

516
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,320
not so good for someone who's not using

517
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,480
system center so one of the things that

518
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
we did when we repeated those exercises

519
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
we raised it up a level right what is

520
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,080
what is your patch management what is

521
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
your configuration management software

522
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,520
what is your help desk use let's talk

523
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,000
about that if that was been compromised

524
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,320
similarly if you're talking about target

525
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,919
the the easy answer is okay we're going

526
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,360
to talk about hvac vendors getting

527
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,799
compromised but what we really need to

528
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,160
be talking about

529
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,240
is third-party vendors

530
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,480
equifax with the apache struts

531
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
vulnerability great example

532
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,160
because

533
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,760
should we be talking about apache struts

534
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,280
or should we be talking about what

535
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,240
happens

536
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,480
when there's an unknown zero-day

537
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,799
code in your environment

538
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,720
that's not your acid inventory how are

539
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,160
you identifying that how are you

540
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,760
protecting against that

541
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
i'd argue that later it's really

542
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,240
important

543
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,799
to bring these stories up a level

544
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,960
so they can be broad

545
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,600
now the the like marketing level

546
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,760
description that's right the the email

547
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,280
that you get would be like zero day

548
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
protection no

549
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
please no

550
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,919
i want to kill every single vendor who

551
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,280
tells me they've got zero day protection

552
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
that's not what i'm saying what i am

553
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,640
saying is

554
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
anyone who did a threat model and has

555
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,280
been running security exercises

556
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,840
on unpatched unknown

557
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,960
java vulnerabilities in their

558
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,160
environment

559
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,280
have had a leg up on the log for j

560
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
vulnerability doesn't mean they've got

561
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,880
zero day protection but what it does

562
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,679
mean is when the event happens if you've

563
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,840
been up a level anything that falls

564
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,520
under that category you've now been

565
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,799
prepared for

566
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,280
so that's how you start with your story

567
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,880
and your scenario now once we get that

568
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
down of course we need a tabletop but we

569
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,840
need to actually make sure that this

570
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,200
makes sense and what it looks like and

571
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,320
what we're going to do

572
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,960
the purpose for any tabletop is to share

573
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,799
out that story and scenario

574
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,799
educate participants on the ir life

575
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,840
cycle

576
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,600
because we forget

577
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,760
the human half life of memory is six

578
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,480
weeks

579
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
if you look at the forgetting curve it's

580
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
even more depressing than that i think

581
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
it's like 30 days

582
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,760
where you forget like half of everything

583
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,720
you hear

584
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,880
so the more frequently you can run

585
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
through this the better and also gaining

586
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,440
consensus on controls

587
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,320
you'd

588
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,600
be surprised or maybe not if you've done

589
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,760
things like this how often the

590
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,080
conversation goes like this uh security

591
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,440
team how would you detect this and they

592
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,760
go oh no problem we would turn to the

593
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,520
networking team that has networking

594
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,720
monitoring set up for the networking

595
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
modern teams like

596
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,320
we uh

597
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,880
on the last refresh two years ago we uh

598
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
didn't renew that licensing so no we

599
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,600
don't monitor any of those ports

600
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,200
security team's like wait i thought you

601
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,039
had full packet capture

602
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,799
we did three years ago but we haven't

603
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,880
recently um that's why we haven't had

604
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,240
any false positives that's a good thing

605
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,840
right

606
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,880
no

607
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,600
so gaining consensus on what controls

608
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,880
actually exist

609
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,720
is one of the benefits of the tabletop

610
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,480
of course getting everyone on the same

611
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
page for for future improvements

612
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,360
so here's where we're going to move from

613
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,760
tactics to controls and start going

614
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,520
through each tactic and listing out what

615
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,880
we can do

616
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
generally back to the beginning back to

617
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,919
time-based security i like to look at

618
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,000
prevent and detect right what can stop

619
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,120
this tactic what can detect it from uh

620
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
if it's occurring

621
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,440
as organizations mature

622
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,720
right if you've got a pretty mature

623
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,039
tabletop you can start looking at some

624
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,760
additional controls like disruption

625
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
deception is

626
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,039
really hot or at least was a couple

627
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,720
years ago

628
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,360
i think you should be really good at

629
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,640
prevent and detect before you even

630
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,880
consider deception but point is there's

631
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,039
additional things you can do

632
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,880
from there

633
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,799
once we've got our tactics

634
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,960
and our detect and prevent we can really

635
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,720
start getting a good handle

636
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,640
on defense and death

637
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,880
uh i am i am

638
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,440
generally a little bit annoyed at the

639
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,600
term defense and depth it's another one

640
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,440
of those things like zero day protection

641
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,039
that wrinkles me i don't think anyone

642
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,559
in 2021

643
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,400
anyone would say oh i don't have

644
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,679
defensiveness thank you for telling me

645
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,559
that i i knew i was missing something

646
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,799
all i needed was more layers of defense

647
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,720
i don't think anyone who's been

648
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,760
compromised uh by a ransomware attack

649
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,039
we'll go you know what if only we had a

650
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,960
couple more layers that probably would

651
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
have sold it the challenge with defense

652
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,039
and depth is it usually doesn't

653
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,559
measure depth against something right

654
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,480
it's not depth against a particular

655
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,840
tactic it's not depth against a

656
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
particular attack it's just general

657
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,760
depth which really translates into how

658
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,159
many products have you bought and

659
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,080
how deep is the stack of licensing

660
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,559
agreements on your desk

661
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
what i like about this approach is i can

662
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
get a real true defense and depth across

663
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,600
the scenario as we miss different

664
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,200
tactics if if a control fails if av is

665
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
evaded as we miss different

666
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,559
tactics we still have a series of depth

667
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,440
along that path to catch them

668
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
so we filled that out so what does that

669
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,000
look like in terms of

670
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,880
um

671
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,440
the overall process

672
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,640
well looks like something like this

673
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,039
we do the scenario threat modeling where

674
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,720
we do the attack stage and the tactic

675
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
tactic description and then we do the

676
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,320
tabletop where we fill in that control

677
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
and the control description if you were

678
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,080
to flip that around and kind of delve

679
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
deeper into that you can look at an

680
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,080
example here with credential access you

681
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
can see how we're tying this down to

682
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,080
multiple levels of prevention detection

683
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,840
you can also see again a really good

684
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,480
example of what i mean by

685
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,200
um you know a better level of defense

686
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
right balloon tower defenses the

687
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,799
balloons kind of move through their path

688
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,960
our ability to hit them and if we miss

689
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,480
okay we've got another monkey who's

690
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,080
going to be throwing a dart balloon

691
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,760
tower defense right

692
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
in this particular attack stage we've

693
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
got multi-factor we've got logging well

694
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,000
multi-factors bypass like that push

695
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,919
example i gave earlier we're going to

696
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,039
have additional stages where we can stop

697
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,919
the adversary

698
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
so there's a couple different things

699
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,640
here with the controls i want to

700
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,279
highlight one we do want to keep it high

701
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,480
level

702
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
i like to map it out to whatever control

703
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
framework the organization is running in

704
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,919
i've done iso

705
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,960
27 series i've done nist of course

706
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,240
cis is also popular so mopping it up to

707
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,679
a high-level guideline is pretty

708
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,440
important but as we know back to the

709
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,840
beds of death well all right our our

710
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,919
control set says we've got logging okay

711
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,039
great

712
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,600
do you log this our control set says we

713
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,880
have locking

714
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,200
do you log that our control

715
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,279
but do you no well

716
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,480
maybe not

717
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,840
we also want to make sure that we're

718
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
going low level and logging at a very

719
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
specific so

720
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
in the control keep it high level and

721
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,080
map to a framework in the description

722
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,000
keep it low level and specific what that

723
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,080
means is we can then map that low level

724
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,960
out

725
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,799
to whoever owns that

726
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,600
to

727
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,120
make sure it's done

728
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,960
to verify it um to audit it and so on

729
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,400
and from a high level we can of course

730
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,240
report that up to our audit committees

731
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,760
and into the c level

732
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,919
this also means from a stage perspective

733
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,520
we can use these coverage metrics for

734
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,840
prevention detection for each one of

735
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,640
these stages of the attack

736
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
all right so now what we have done right

737
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
we've got a story we've got a scenario

738
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,880
we've table top that okay we've talked

739
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
through the controls and we're good we

740
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
think we're good now what we need to do

741
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,080
is actually make sure that the controls

742
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,480
work which is where we get to

743
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,080
uh adversarial emulation uh or sometimes

744
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
red teaming or what have you

745
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,279
where we're gonna actually exercise

746
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,039
these controls so if you say we've got

747
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,039
80 authentication logging all right

748
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,640
we're going to attempt to log into a

749
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
disabled account and make sure

750
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,799
someone actually does something

751
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,559
it's actually a true story i it was one

752
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,240
of my controls

753
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,679
and i came in i had friday off i came in

754
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,880
on monday and my logs were just full my

755
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,960
scene was screaming my logs were full

756
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,480
turned to the guy i was on deck why did

757
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,679
you do anything

758
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,200
he's like well i i just figured it was

759
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,799
something you were screwing around with

760
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,279
like why would i screw around with a

761
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,720
disabled account it's like you're always

762
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,640
adding controls and alerts in this thing

763
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
i never know what's going on and sure

764
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,840
enough we had someone who had been

765
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,640
terminated who spent the entire weekend

766
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,200
trying to break into our network

767
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
so testing that and making sure someone

768
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
responds

769
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
similar to something like uh email

770
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,480
controls

771
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,640
right and exercising with it and i t

772
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,799
security to test each one of those

773
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,919
tactics

774
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,039
and determine control readiness ideally

775
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,240
you know in the beginning maybe it's a

776
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,400
manual process but ideally as you mature

777
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,159
that becomes an automated process a

778
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,720
scriptable process a repeatable process

779
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
the time and time again is verifying

780
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,240
those controls

781
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,840
and that's what really allows you to to

782
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,520
catch um any gaps in our understanding i

783
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,960
thought we had monitoring well we didn't

784
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,880
really know the licensing it also allows

785
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,159
us to catch any gaps that occurs from

786
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,720
like typical it operations

787
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,039
so i was doing this with a medical

788
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,399
provider

789
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,880
one of their strong controls was a very

790
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,720
well locked down

791
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,840
kiosk

792
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,520
kiosk in each

793
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,080
room so a patient facing kiosk there's

794
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,200
12 of them

795
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,360
and these kiosks had a

796
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,440
awesome certificate-based awesome great

797
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,600
not just mac address which you know

798
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,520
we can bypass pretty easily

799
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,000
but certificate-based awesome 12 of them

800
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,120
great so i said all right i sent my team

801
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,880
to go verify that because that was one

802
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,159
of their main controls against

803
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,720
preventing the type of a scenario where

804
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,279
we're mentioning first one fine second

805
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,039
one fine six one five seventh one fine

806
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360
one out of those 12 did not have the

807
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,799
control in place

808
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,799
for whatever reason knack had been

809
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,919
disabled

810
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,559
moreover more concerning to me

811
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,640
was not only was it disabled

812
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,720
how it was also

813
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,320
not set to log

814
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,630
so

815
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,919
[Music]

816
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,360
we were able to plug in our attack

817
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
proceed and

818
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,760
blast through the rest of the scenario

819
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,000
and uh pretty quickly demonstrate some

820
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,279
real risk

821
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,080
so

822
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,000
kind of disconcerting when if you're the

823
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,720
cso or the security director leader

824
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,080
who's thinking i'm fine i've got an act

825
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,640
do you know do you really

826
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
because without exercising that defense

827
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
we really have

828
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
no assurance as to whether or not it

829
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,080
works we really don't and that's

830
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,159
something i think we forget all too

831
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,760
often

832
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,279
one additional comment i want to leave

833
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,279
here is we gotta create evidence when

834
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,200
we're testing these things out but not

835
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,120
incidents so it's very important that

836
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,640
when we're testing these things just

837
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,559
like a pen test

838
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,399
that we're very cautious about what we

839
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,640
exploit and what we pull on and what we

840
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,679
flip over um so we don't uh damage

841
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,279
anything

842
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,919
all right last section uh keeping score

843
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,679
metrics let's talk a little bit about

844
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,880
some numbers

845
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
um first off how often should you do

846
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,720
this we don't no there's no one knows

847
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,000
a lot a little no one knows

848
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,960
uh one thing that may be interesting

849
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,039
directionally is

850
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,279
cisco released the security outcomes uh

851
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,120
study volume two

852
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,640
about a month ago

853
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,440
and looked at these types of exercises

854
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,679
but for disaster recovery

855
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,559
so the question was um

856
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,799
how many exercises per month and that

857
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,200
includes tabletops that includes plan

858
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,039
reads that includes full polls the whole

859
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,159
nine hearts

860
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,799
how many exercises per month

861
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,320
would

862
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,520
generate

863
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,000
the highest degree of

864
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,120
uh confidence and uh you know

865
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,600
performance in the bcdr outcome

866
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
and they found that number is five right

867
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,919
organizations are doing five

868
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,399
exercises a month and again plan through

869
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,200
tabletop through actual technical

870
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,919
exercise were the ones that had the

871
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,640
highest reported uh numbers of

872
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,200
continuity and recovery success so in

873
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
that world five in my world when i was

874
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,279
security officer a few years ago we were

875
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,360
doing a monthly so somewhere between

876
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,240
five and one is where i would think we

877
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,279
would be

878
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,360
from a metrics perspective i think it's

879
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
more about just tracking the number held

880
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,440
and then slowly growing that up over

881
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,799
time

882
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,799
in each one of those tabletops looking

883
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,960
at the defense and depth numbers i

884
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
mentioned as well as the stage control

885
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,720
numbers i demonstrated those are really

886
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,679
good metrics for an individual tabletop

887
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,480
for a exercise itself again number of

888
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,960
exercises held control effectiveness if

889
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,120
you're batting like

890
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
fifty percent or sixty percent or even

891
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,360
seventy percent of your control is being

892
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,399
effective

893
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,640
um you've got a problem right we've got

894
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,440
a big disconnect between what we think

895
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,000
we have and what we really have

896
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
generally your control should be 90

897
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,519
percent or more effective if i think

898
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,039
i've got

899
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,279
12 stations with neck all 12 stations

900
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,760
should have neck

901
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,440
and then of course

902
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,120
if you've got your sock team watching

903
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,320
this how long does it take them to

904
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,200
detect and to respond that time metric

905
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,279
is is really critical as i mentioned

906
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,120
earlier to

907
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
running the whole ir process how quickly

908
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,559
can we identify

909
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,399
and jump on

910
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,559
the ir process pull down the right run

911
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,559
book and execute it

912
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,480
by doing multiple of these

913
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,880
we can begin to pull out common themes

914
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,640
we can begin to map them across

915
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,960
different exercises and start building

916
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,519
some really good plans for improvement

917
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,679
and by using controls that map up to a

918
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,840
higher level framework we can also

919
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,799
spot out uh you know any any hot spots

920
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,960
or areas where we need to jump on

921
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,679
and

922
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,000
level up

923
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
so in conclusion right shall we play a

924
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,279
game yes yes yes

925
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,760
but not this kind of game no fun

926
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,039
no fud

927
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,159
simply

928
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,399
um security exercises which arguably war

929
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,120
games was a little bit of flood

930
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
that led to a whole bunch of cyber

931
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,600
security laws but you get my point

932
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,760
security exercises

933
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,120
drills

934
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,080
finding ways to detect faster respond

935
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,159
faster by doing the actual scenarios

936
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,000
communicating them out getting people on

937
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,519
the same page

938
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,120
i mentioned at the beginning that would

939
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,240
give a maturity model so let me walk you

940
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
through what that looks like in the

941
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,039
beginning it's very ad hoc i've got a

942
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,159
story i'm going to tell it i'm going to

943
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,240
tell it and i want you know our team

944
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,919
meetings i'm going to tell it uh you

945
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,399
know our security awareness it's very ad

946
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,600
hoc

947
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,840
level two is taking that scenario making

948
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,120
it more formal laying in the the ttps

949
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,480
and and doing the tabletop level three

950
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,720
is taking that tabletop and tying those

951
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,200
tactics and controls out

952
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,640
to uh to make it very clear what is what

953
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,720
and making sure we've got good consensus

954
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,919
on that

955
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,320
level four is making sure those tactics

956
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,480
and controls are tied to frameworks and

957
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,720
are tracked in a unified fashion

958
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,919
consistently

959
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,399
and that we're doing exercises

960
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,960
and level five the most mature one

961
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,120
is where we are doing all that the table

962
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,039
tops the tactics the controls we got a

963
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,200
framework we got exercises but now we're

964
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,880
automating those

965
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,600
um we are uh in some cases some

966
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,360
organizations are also

967
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,440
pairing this level five pairing this

968
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,440
with chaos engineering where you also

969
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,080
have additional things happening to

970
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,159
test and verify the environment

971
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,480
and we're moving towards a continuous

972
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,640
improvement approach if you're looking

973
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,399
for a way to mature

974
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,320
this security capability which again i

975
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,000
would argue is really fundamental uh to

976
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,560
moving beyond just compliance i mean

977
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,359
beyond just check boxes really having a

978
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,359
strong ir capability

979
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,760
that that works when you need it

980
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,000
here's a maturity model you can follow

981
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,679
and of course behind the scenes of all

982
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,560
that

983
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,119
going ahead and keeping track of metrics

984
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,119
so that you can demonstrate success and

985
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,359
improve

986
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,159
that's it for me um i will pause for a

987
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,159
question i think i got a couple minutes

988
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,239
that qr code you can trust me you can

989
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,800
trust me it is my website or you can

990
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,960
type it in uh and there's my contact

991
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,800
information as well if you want to i'll

992
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,399
reach out for any questions that we

993
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,759
don't have a chance to get to today
