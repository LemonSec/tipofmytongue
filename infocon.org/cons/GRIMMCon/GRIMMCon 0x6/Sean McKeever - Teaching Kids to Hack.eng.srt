00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,560
i'm known as dorkvader on twitter and um

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,920
formerly i was a cyber security

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
architect for a very large automotive

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,238

uh i'm a parent to two children and

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,840
uh

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
one very grumpy cat

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,680
and uh got a couple of my my projects

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,399
here on display uh this is this

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,480
little uh beast on the stairs is one of

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,399
my robo cars and then

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,039
um down below it is a very rudimentary

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,680
can bus bench that i built for uh the

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,520
hack for kids village at def con in 2019

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,760
so you'd see me over here at defcon a

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
couple of years ago i have not been out

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,520
in public like that in quite some time

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,519
unfortunately but i hope to get back to

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,600
it

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,200
so um

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,680
teaching kids to hack you know i'm gonna

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,960
start off with some ethics uh with um a

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,640
nod to uh

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,159
tom who who reminded me i should

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,159
probably put that in and then we'll go

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,439
through a few

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,360
uh whys in house and whatnot also there

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,079
will be cats on nearly every slide

34
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
so um i hope you enjoy cat pictures

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,200
um

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
so the ethics you know

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,439
kids are gonna replicate and elaborate

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,720
on their own

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
so you know when you're teaching them

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,040
things outside of a lab or a classroom

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,720
they're gonna try to replicate that

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
stuff so you know don't teach them how

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
to pop shells until you know your

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,360
audience really understands

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,920
the uh the gravity of that situation and

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,040
the law

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,159
um

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,640
i'm fortunate in that i grew up in an

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,439
age where it was really difficult to get

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,600
to other people's stuff so i had free

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
reign to do whatever i wanted on the

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
computers

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,239
i had my hands on

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,120
but um

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,400
not not everybody has that luxury

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
anymore and one second i have a physical

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,280
interrupt here

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,080
um

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
we got an oculus for christmas so that's

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
a hot community right now i apologize

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
um

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,120
so yeah like i said i had a lot of

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
freedom when i was learning how to how

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
to break things because i was isolated

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,599
but all of our computers and electronic

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,840
devices these days are connected so make

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,440
sure you're you're really explaining

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,959
that and

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,760
they

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,519
you know the uh the people you're

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,280
teaching be they children or adults

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,760
understand the uh

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,360
the ramifications of what they're

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
learning

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,239
so teaching kids to hack you know when i

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,159
first started putting this together

77
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,200
like well you know we have all these

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,879
skills shortages and everything and all

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,120
these headlines and you know but really

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,080
that's not my motivation here you know

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
um

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
there's a this isn't a true saying i

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,040
kind of made this up to summarize a

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,440
couple sayings but you know in like kung

85
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
fu the student isn't really a master

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,840
until they have their own students

87
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,519
and um

88
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,480
you know i see that in just every day

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
and what i do you know um

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,640
i learned three ways i learned by

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,080
reading stuff

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,840
by doing those things but then when i

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
really solidified is when i teach

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
someone else to do it

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
um i'll give you an example i have

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,879
taught myself python

97
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,920
three maybe four times now

98
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
and i still can't really do it very well

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,239
because i don't use it every day

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,080
but um

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,959
you know if i were to set out and build

102
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,480
out you know a

103
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,080
class for some high school students or

104
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,000
some middle school students using you

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
know say an adafruit circuit playground

106
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,799
and and taught them python i would have

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,720
to force myself to really know it better

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,159
than i do today

109
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,159
and and really ingest the material and

110
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,640
use it in a meaningful way

111
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,079
then i would feel comfortable that you

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,440
know yes i can program in python so i've

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
done that with

114
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
pretty much

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,759
um

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,440
anything i've really

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
mastered i've really come through that

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
mastery through teaching it to someone

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
else

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,880
and uh why kids well

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
they're fun

122
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
you know i'm a parent so i might be

123
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,400
biased but you know

124
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
playing with kids is is a fun way to do

125
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
things and

126
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
seeing the um

127
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,080
you know their skills develop and grow

128
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,040
is a lot more fun and rewarding i find

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
um than just getting up and giving a

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
conference talk not that not to to write

131
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
conference talks at all giving one right

132
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,199
now but um you know i i really enjoy

133
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,600
that feedback and and seeing that

134
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,639
develop

135
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
in kids

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
um

137
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
so

138
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,039
we're gonna do it

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,560
one of the tips and one of the one of

140
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,919
the things that i find really useful

141
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,840
when i'm trying to engage

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,759
is you've got 10 minutes and sometimes

143
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,199
less depending on the age of your

144
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,600
audience but if you can't

145
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,840
get them hooked in 10 minutes no amount

146
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
of cat pictures is going to keep them

147
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
engaged in what you're doing

148
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
you know i brought visual aids because i

149
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,479
have them so

150
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,000
you know if i stood up in front of a

151
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
classroom with this and said okay kids

152
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
today we're going to teach you about can

153
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,880
bus networking and how uh vehicle

154
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,039
computers talk to each other over that

155
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,720
network but you know by the time i

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,560
finish that sentence they don't be bored

157
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
but if i told them today we're going to

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,160
drive this monster truck into each other

159
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
um from a

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
text prompt and i'm going to teach you

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,600
guys how that works i've got a better

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
chance of keeping them engaged

163
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,199
um

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,479
and

165
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
i i have done that in real life it's

166
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,160
also more fun if it's a kinetic thing

167
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,520
and you can make yourself the target

168
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
because then they can

169
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,880
chase you around and try and trip you or

170
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,560
try and uh smash you in the ankles

171
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,919
and to that end

172
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,720
starting at the end you know

173
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,560
give them the demo first instead of just

174
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
you know showing them the car show them

175
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,120
the car driving around and explain as

176
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
you go or if you've i've

177
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
seen a talk with a lock picking robot

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,680
and

179
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,240
you know it was a 35-40 minute talk at

180
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,560
defcon about how they built this robot

181
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,360
and everything to pick safes and then

182
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,039
they gave the demo well that's great at

183
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,479
def con because you're in a room full of

184
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,000
people who are

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
invested and interested in what you're

186
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,000
doing but if you do that to uh you know

187
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
a group of middle school students

188
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
they're going to be bored 15 minutes in

189
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
so start with the robot and work

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,240
backwards give them the demo of the

191
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,960
robot picking the safe first and then

192
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
step through how you got to that and

193
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,479
explain it as you go

194
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,160
and one of the things i always focus on

195
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
is trying to build curiosity not

196
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
expertise

197
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,319
um

198
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,800
the stuff i'm teaching today

199
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
by the time they get through you know

200
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,039
high school and college and get into the

201
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,759
workforce is not necessarily going to be

202
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,360
relevant anymore but building that

203
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,319
curiosity and trying to

204
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,440
spark that inspiration that's going to

205
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,520
move them on to do bigger and better

206
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,440
things is really the true

207
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,319
value and something like this

208
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,400
but you know expect

209
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,520
that they're going to understand what

210
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
you're talking about you know kids are a

211
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,160
lot smarter than anybody realizes

212
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,720
um i've seen this with myself

213
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
one of my boys built a game in roblox

214
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
yesterday and put legal disclaimers on

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,319
it that it was

216
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,919
entertainment only

217
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,360
um

218
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
i would have never you know considered

219
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,039
that something that he would need to do

220
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,360
but you know it's something that he just

221
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
picked up on his own through

222
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,840
experiencing other other games

223
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,560
and

224
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
scenarios like that

225
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
along those lines

226
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,400
um you know

227
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,960
kids are honest the nice thing about

228
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,759
being in front of a room full of kids is

229
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,960
you know

230
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
when you're bombing

231
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,080
right

232
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,599
you're not gonna have to guess you're

233
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,520
not gonna have to deal with you know

234
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
politeness

235
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,080
you're gonna know when you're missing

236
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
your mark

237
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,080
um you know it's a it's it's like i i

238
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,958
like to call it a self-tuning exercise

239
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,719
you can tell when they're uh they're no

240
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,958
longer engaged and what content isn't

241
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,279
working so being able to you know it

242
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,958
trains you to think on your feet and

243
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,679
improvise and pivot quickly

244
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,880
uh but

245
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,519
just like any other audience they uh

246
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,040
they want to get something out of it

247
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,839
right

248
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,080
um

249
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
i also have done um

250
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,519
improv comedy as as a thing

251
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,839
and uh one of the things they taught us

252
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,680
in our intro class was you know the

253
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
audience wants to see you succeed

254
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,560
they're not showing up to pick on you or

255
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
make you feel um

256
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,600
bad

257
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
so you know trust that and

258
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,640
and let them

259
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,600
enjoy your success kids are the same way

260
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
right just like any other person they

261
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,480
don't

262
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,160
want to show up for failure they want to

263
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,560
see you do well

264
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
um

265
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,080
some other things that i've uh i've had

266
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
happen to me firsthand they're gonna

267
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
break things often in ways you don't

268
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,200
expect them to

269
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,920
um you know you can plan your your your

270
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,560
class or your demo

271
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
and replay it a hundred times but as

272
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,320
soon as you put it in the you know put

273
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
it in the hands of 40

274
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
40 kids they're gonna do things you

275
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
didn't think of

276
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
and uh you know

277
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,959
that's part of the learning for both for

278
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,080
everybody and uh you know it's it's

279
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,120
honestly

280
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
one of the most fun parts of it

281
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,440
um

282
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,000
as well along that along those lines

283
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
they're gonna some of them are gonna

284
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
pick it up a lot faster than you or in a

285
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,680
different way than you did

286
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,760
and you know that's again another

287
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,120
learning opportunity for you as the

288
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,079
person running the course as well as as

289
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,040
you know

290
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
the kids taking it

291
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
um

292
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,240
and finally they're gonna question

293
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,440
everything

294
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
but also sometimes nothing

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,720
it's um really hard to anticipate what's

296
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,800
gonna come out of it so you know keeping

297
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
an open mind and

298
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
being flexible while you're working

299
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
through uh your

300
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,440
your project or your goals with them is

301
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
you know a very rewarding thing it's

302
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,000
it's helped me

303
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
be better at defining say requirements

304
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
in my real job because i can look you

305
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,959
you can kind of put yourself in that

306
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,959
mindset of well what am i not thinking

307
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,279
of what would somebody who's not looking

308
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,560
at this every day what would they ask

309
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,200
so i've kind of sprinkled this

310
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
throughout but you know how does this

311
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,760
make you a better hacker you know

312
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,600
um

313
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
this one is not a cat pic but i think it

314
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,480
summarizes it well um you know if you

315
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball

316
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,079
right if you can teach a room full of

317
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,399
middle school students how to drive a

318
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,880
car with can bus injection then you can

319
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,320
sit down with

320
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
a c-level executive explain to them why

321
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,519
allowing can bus injection on their

322
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,600
vehicle is a bad idea

323
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,880
right you've tuned that uh

324
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,680
tool set to be able to break a

325
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,600
a complex

326
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,160
nuanced topic down into bite-sized

327
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,199
speaking points

328
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,720
this also helps

329
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
change my perspective on things right i

330
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,680
at least personally tend to over

331
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
complicate stuff especially when i'm

332
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
trying to troubleshoot something

333
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,560
but

334
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,120
being contin you know exposing myself to

335
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
the thought processes

336
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,639
of a less

337
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,639
burdened mind i'll say you know somebody

338
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,880
who isn't also thinking about you know i

339
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,200
gotta pick up dinner tonight and did i

340
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
pack everything for lunch and do the

341
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
kids have clean laundry tomorrow you

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
know they they

343
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,800
should focus in on the details and be in

344
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
the moment a lot

345
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
easier than i can

346
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,360
and

347
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,399
you know

348
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
training myself just recognize that and

349
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,279
use that in my day-to-day work this has

350
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,600
been really helpful

351
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,959
um

352
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,360
and you know as i said earlier the same

353
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,519
skills work with with all audiences um

354
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,519
you know versus explaining it to a

355
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,519
manager or somebody else in the business

356
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,040
who has nothing to do with security or

357
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
the product but has to fix a problem

358
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,440
that's been identified being able to

359
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
explain it to them in a way that is

360
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,000
pertinent to their skill set and what

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,160
they need to be able to do

362
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,880
is very useful especially in a

363
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,800
cyber security role where you're often

364
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,680
seen as the bad guy or the traffic cop

365
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
or the enforcer who just makes

366
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
everybody's day bad when they show up to

367
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
the meeting

368
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
and finally i know uh hillary mentioned

369
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,040
this but kids are more fun than

370
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
toastmasters at least in my opinion i

371
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
don't mind speaking in front of an

372
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,839
audience i kind of enjoy it but

373
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
working with kids is much more like play

374
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
than you know getting up and just giving

375
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,760
a uh a presentation to my team

376
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,360
not that i don't enjoy talking to my

377
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
team i do very much but you know it's

378
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,680
it's expected that you're gonna play

379
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
when you're working with kids and i i

380
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,760
really enjoy that it's not something

381
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,320
that you always get to do in adult life

382
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,760
as much as maybe we should

383
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
so uh

384
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
this is probably the busiest slide in my

385
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,959
uh my presentation but getting started

386
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,880
so first of all

387
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,279
you gotta have something to share right

388
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,760
um and the way i like to look at it is

389
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,839
you know do i have something existing

390
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,480
like say you know this guy right here

391
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
that needs something this has got lidar

392
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,600
on it this lidar doesn't work

393
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
well if i set up a

394
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,880
a plan to i'm gonna teach

395
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,639
a high school first robotics team how

396
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,639
lidar works i have to get it working and

397
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,120
now i have a deadline and now i'm gonna

398
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
you know commit to figuring out the

399
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
python library and figuring out how to

400
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,279
reverse engineer the code for the lidar

401
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,519
into my existing code base to drive the

402
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,480
car

403
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
um and i find that's the most effective

404
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,920
way for me to get non-work things

405
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,160
accomplished is having a

406
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,120
a

407
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,920
driver to accomplishing that

408
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
or like i said earlier do i want to

409
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,320
learn something new like python or you

410
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
know um

411
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,199
cloud

412
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,959
encryption or you know something that i

413
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,880
don't do every day but i i want to make

414
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,600
sure that i solidify that in my brain

415
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,560
or

416
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,920
something that fills a specific need um

417
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,320
you know when a lot of when

418
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,639
the first coveted lockdowns happened i

419
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
put together a presentation for my local

420
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,079
school district on internet security

421
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,040
because

422
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,880
you suddenly had teachers and school

423
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
administrators and parents and kids all

424
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,880
using the internet a lot more than they

425
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
did every day

426
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,600
and a lot of parents were really

427
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
concerned about making sure their kids

428
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
were you know not getting into things

429
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,959
they didn't they shouldn't be getting

430
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,880
into and whatnot so i put together a

431
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,279
presentation for the school district

432
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,959
uh some things

433
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,040
parents teachers and the kids could do

434
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,519
to make sure that they're um

435
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
trying to be a little safer online

436
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,120
uh you know with just a huge roll out of

437
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
technology without a lot of planning

438
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,639
it's kind of a perfect storm for

439
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,639
mistakes

440
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,800
but once you have a topic or something

441
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
that you want to share you need to build

442
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
content or use something that already

443
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,000
exists

444
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,680
so um

445
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,839
i've listed off a couple things here i

446
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,639
love the adafruit products they've got a

447
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,199
lot of educational bent to them and a

448
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,360
lot of pre-built

449
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,600
projects that are easy to adapt into a

450
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,199
classroom environment

451
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,759
most of them are dynamic or kinetic or a

452
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,839
combination of all of that which is

453
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,600
really engaging

454
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,199
especially with younger

455
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,480
younger kids who who want to see that

456
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,079
real world result

457
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,120
of what they're doing hands-on

458
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,199
um one of the things one of my one of my

459
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,360
kids is really into right now is scratch

460
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,279
and building out you know programming

461
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,040
through that visually

462
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
uh there's also along the same lines in

463
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,639
the osmo system

464
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,519
um minecraft is great

465
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,120
there's a lot of um youtube resources on

466
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,199
modifying it or hacking your own

467
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,519
minecraft server and

468
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,040
kids like minecraft not as much as they

469
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
used to but you know still it gives it

470
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
something tangible that they can relate

471
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,639
to

472
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,359
um and then more hacker bent stuff the

473
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,599
hack for kids workshops that are at

474
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,520
a lot of hacker conferences um i haven't

475
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,359
directly participated in them i did

476
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,679
build a bench for one at defcon a couple

477
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,280
years ago was unfortunately not able to

478
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,839
also participate in

479
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,199
in that

480
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,679
in ctfs i've got some listed over on the

481
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,559
uh

482
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,039
right side of my slide here um

483
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
you know but again that

484
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,679
falls into the ethics area make sure

485
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,280
that you know your audience and that

486
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,640
you're

487
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
putting proper guardrails in so they're

488
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,840
they're using what they're learning

489
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,440
appropriately and not getting into

490
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
trouble later

491
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,000
um

492
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,720
next you need an audience

493
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,880
and you know there's

494
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
a lot of different ways you could go

495
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
about it schools are always looking for

496
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
parents or members of the community who

497
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
want to be engaged and involved in

498
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,880
helping put stuff together

499
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,760
um

500
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,679
i put clubs because it's kind of a

501
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,440
loosely defined thing

502
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,080
um by clubs i mean like

503
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,039
first robotics or you know a scouts

504
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,039
program or

505
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,720
you know um

506
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,120
a church group or any anything anything

507
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,679
you're affiliated with that you know

508
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,640
um

509
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,360
has kids has kids involved

510
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,640
and uh also maker spaces uh i there's a

511
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,280
great one down the street from me um i3

512
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
detroit and they're always

513
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
trying to engage with the community

514
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,720
um to bring more people into the space

515
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
because the more members they have the

516
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,960
more resources they have to to build new

517
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
stuff

518
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
so you know

519
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,120
and along those lines they also already

520
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,799
have a lot of resources that you can

521
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,840
leverage

522
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,760
to put this stuff together

523
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,360
i don't have room in my house for a 3d

524
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
printer but the makerspace has four you

525
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
know so if i want to do a thing on 3d

526
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,480
printing and and stuff they have the

527
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,960
room for that stuff

528
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,880
and then finally you know you gotta just

529
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,520
do the thing um

530
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,559
you know

531
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,960
get get a group together work through it

532
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,640
iterate it and you know um

533
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,520
have fun with it

534
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,960
so um

535
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,559
touched on it a little bit but some

536
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,080
resources you know like i said

537
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
hackfromkids.com

538
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,559
adafruit the patriot program is a good

539
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,640
one for high school students along with

540
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
uh pico ctf from carnegie mellon

541
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
hackthebox.com

542
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,000
a little more advanced stuff i really

543
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,240
like the sans holiday hack although i

544
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,480
every year i sign up and then i then the

545
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,080
holidays actually happen and i don't

546
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,559
really get to it but one of these days i

547
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,640
i really want to if you've got some

548
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,440
younger kids the kiwiko crates are

549
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,919
pretty good with varying levels

550
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,280
of what you can do there um

551
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,520
and then i plugged first robotics i

552
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
plugged them a lot because they also

553
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,360
helped build these things actually

554
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,400
um

555
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,080
some of the hardware in here is direct

556
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
from uh robots used in the first

557
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,559
robotics competitions

558
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,320
and uh so

559
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,679
without

560
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,840
that existing my my little robo cars

561
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
here probably wouldn't work as well as

562
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,880
they do

563
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,679
and i did get to work with the team at

564
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,400
my former employer um

565
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,799
the team they sponsored they they helped

566
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,360
build these things with us and

567
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,039
give us ideas for ways we could make

568
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,960
them better

569
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,559
then code wizards hq and udemy.com those

570
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,240
were just things i googled up i don't

571
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
have first-hand experience with them but

572
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,360
they they do have some courseware there

573
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,120
for kids

574
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,280
so

575
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,080
i'm a little faster than i plan to be

576
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,280
but that's uh those are my slides

577
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,039
so thank you everybody thank you for um
