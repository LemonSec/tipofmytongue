00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
we're gonna hand it over to uh vivec

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,240
panada did i get that right

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,680
you did hey johnny thanks a lot

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,439
all right so uh hopefully you're able to

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,960
see my screen

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,840
okay

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,040
so

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,640
just a little bit about me

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,160
my background has always been in

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
industrial controls i've been doing ot

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,280
security for the past eight years or so

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
electrical engineering i have an mba in

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
finance i'm a sand cert in industrial

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,559
control security

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,480
currently i work for ici electrical

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,120
engineering my past roles i was with ge

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
i worked a lot with turbans like you

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,199
mentioned control systems for turbans

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,440
was my background for quite some time

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,359
i'm also the co-lead for the top 20

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,239
secure plc coding practices project

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,359
and uh

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,438
you'll see this in industrial controls

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,439
quite a bit most people have traveled

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,880
quite a bit around the world so those of

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,400
you that haven't considered joining

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,320
industrial control security highly

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,080
recommend it uh there will be nafta

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,840
times hopefully with covet and then

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,280
you'll get to travel quite a bit around

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
the world

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
my contact info is here

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,799
and uh just a little bit more personal

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,040
stuff when the weather is warm and nice

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,119
i like to do these two things

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,799
when it's not so nice i like to do this

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,960
thing however this is how my backyard

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
looked like yesterday so right now it's

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,840
a lot more convenient and enjoyable

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
being in front of

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,840
you folks than doing anything outside at

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,240
15f

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,000
all right so

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
ot

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,759
amped up attention right so we've all

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,000
heard all these kind of

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,119
news bits and media articles um this

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,439
past year so back in may colonial

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,880
pipeline and then in june jbs and then

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,159
in july this healthcare uh you know uvm

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,799
uh ransomware attack and then of course

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,560
you know mandiant which is an instrument

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,600
response

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,919
company talked about how

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,480
actors are um aggressively pursuing

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,239
healthcare targets you know even though

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,520
we're in the middle of the worst

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,480
pandemic we can imagine right and then

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
back in february you'll remember not

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
just ransomware but this uh

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,959
incident at old smart florida with

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,840
insecurity more taxes now i'm gonna not

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
list all the things that happened right

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
so these are just some highlights but

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
the key is unless you've been living on

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,080
a rock you know you're probably thinking

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,480
man there's so much going on in ot a lot

71
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,879
of attacks happening are we at risk for

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,879
critical infrastructure or

73
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,560
on the other hand maybe you're thinking

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,879
man with all this news you know maybe we

75
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,519
should do something really quickly

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,120
maybe the governments are thinking let's

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
do something about it

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
but i want to quote ralph langner here

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,440
he's the guy that discovered and decoded

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,560
stuxnet so that means something to you

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,319
he said wake up calls don't change a

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,120
thing

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
makeup calls are irrelevant he said this

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
in 2018 after many years of pursuing he

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
mentioned you know there's a talk on s4

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,280
2018 where he mentioned and he's been

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,959
chasing you know congressman you know

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,400
government officials and industry um

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
you know leaders in in doing something

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,239
about ot security but

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,400
the pace has been much slower than he

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,840
expected back in the 2009-2010 time

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
period

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
so

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,239
that you should remember that nothing

96
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,560
moves really fast in the ot world

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
it's also confusing for onlookers right

98
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,920
you hear these two terms i t ot divide

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,799
and you also hear itot convergence

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,200
and for someone that's not deeply

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
embedded in ot it is very confusing

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,200
are we saying it and ot are very divided

103
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,080
but somehow they're also converging

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
so

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,799
the itot divide and here i i mentioned

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,480
this um you know

107
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
drago's article where they mentioned

108
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,560
that the cultural divide between it and

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
ot blocks 65 percent of the

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,799
organizations from having a unified

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,799
cyber security strategy

112
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,798
i mean no matter how deep you are in ot

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,880
or not i mean this sounds bad right that

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,959
somehow companies are not able to

115
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,440
provide a coherent strategy uh because

116
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
of this divide and there is a reason for

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
that so the i.t people historically have

118
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,520
focused on information right so the cia

119
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
triad we all know confidentiality

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,840
integrity availability

121
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,919
that's the focus on i.t security or

122
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,479
focus for i.t security however for the

123
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,800
ot people historically or industrial

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
controls in general there is another

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,199
triad called srp which is safety

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,759
reliability and productivity or some

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,080
people might use efficiency here either

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,960
way

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,199
because the focus is on different things

130
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,800
of course there's a cultural divide i

131
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
mean it's not that hard to imagine why

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,840
right because if you're focused on

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,160
information you focus on this if you

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
focus on plant operation and safety and

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,960
reliability um you obviously will have

136
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,880
different priorities so that's why

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
cultural divide exists okay

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,320
then on this side itot convergence

139
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,639
you obviously uh will hear a lot about

140
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,440
digital transformation industry 4.0 i

141
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,240
don't mean to throw jargon at you but or

142
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,440
you know the latest and greatest

143
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
whatever um

144
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,680
buzzwords the key is if you talk to any

145
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,080
of these consultants or any of the um

146
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,759
you know i.t security folks that are

147
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,320
helping manufacturing move forward smart

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
manufacturing digital manufacturing

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,479
there's a lot of conversions because the

150
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,919
technologies

151
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
are so similar whatever is being used in

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,960
ot

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,880
and whatever is being used

154
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,919
are so similar in fact i quote rob lee

155
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,919
he's a senior science instructor and a

156
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,880
co-founder of drago's he mentioned this

157
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
technology conversions happened a long

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,800
time ago but the missions will remain

159
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,440
different right because the focus again

160
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,639
the mission for ot people is this srp

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,520
triad so even if the technology

162
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
convergence happened for the most part

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,639
in ot at purdue level 2 for example or

164
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,360
going forward in iot and

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
manufacturing or anything that you can

166
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
imagine the mission will remain

167
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,479
different for the otp okay so that's why

168
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,000
it's a little confusing for folks that

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
are coming from outside

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
now what exactly is ot well let's ask

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
this question taking a step back right

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,919
i'm sure in this traditional purdue

173
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,280
model

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,840
you'll see this neat little segmentation

175
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,919
you know you got this level zero devices

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,000
you got uh you know the controllers at

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
level one

178
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
the hmis and local con you know local

179
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,840
control operating stations at level two

180
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,039
um and you all are very familiar with it

181
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,440
the thing is you will not find a single

182
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
plant in the whole planet that is so

183
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
neatly segmented like this right this is

184
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,720
just a model that is useful however it's

185
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
not entirely accurate not entirely

186
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
relevant for each site

187
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,960
because there are many other things that

188
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
are not probably represented or

189
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,759
represented correctly um for that site

190
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,639
right

191
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,520
so

192
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,199
as an example the traditional purdue

193
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,199
model doesn't talk about clerks cloud

194
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,560
services

195
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,919
and these days you know with all the

196
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,160
optimization analytics there might be

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,680
some kind of tentacles from a cloud

198
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
service provider all the way back to you

199
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,880
know level three maybe even level two

200
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
and maybe some sensors the iot

201
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,560
or the industrial iot you know devices

202
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
there are sensors and then again you

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
know some kind of cloud connectivity all

204
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,479
the way back to level zero or level one

205
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,800
so those things are not represented here

206
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
right in fact if you go to this webpage

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,720
you'll see that there is a discussion

208
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,039
about if this purdue model is dead and

209
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
an alternative

210
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
pictorial showing you know what other

211
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
things would be considered relevant

212
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
along with the traditional purdue model

213
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,039
it's not dead but it's not entirely

214
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,280
accurate for you know each of the

215
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
uh sites that you would you will work

216
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,720
with right

217
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,599
so here i uh quote patrick miller again

218
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,440
another luminary i like to do this on

219
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,759
these slides because i want you all to

220
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,440
think about this and then go find them

221
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,360
on twitter or on youtube because they

222
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,599
have amazing content out there uh very

223
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,080
useful these are all ot luminaries right

224
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,680
he said we've always characterized

225
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,080
security in terms of ot and it but going

226
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,800
forward it's just t right that's because

227
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,120
you see all this technology here most of

228
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,360
this is now windows-based so if you're

229
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,960
coming from i.t

230
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,680
historically maybe 20 years ago

231
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
maybe the devices that you found here

232
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,640
were

233
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
proprietary and maybe things that you

234
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,958
didn't understand but a lot of it people

235
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,679
now will be very familiar uh with all

236
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
the hardware here

237
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
so it's not as different as it used to

238
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
be right so a lot more

239
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,440
unifying concepts and technologies these

240
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
days and that's again the convergence

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,519
now growing pains right

242
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,360
what we hear about an incident or after

243
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
an incident is our ot systems weren't

244
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,519
affected um in fact we heard this

245
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,080
clearly loud and clear after colonial

246
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,760
where they mentioned they shut down the

247
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,600
operation of the pipelines however they

248
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,680
said only the it systems were affected

249
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
and the ot systems were not affected

250
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
like it matters

251
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
right and we'll come to that in a second

252
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
we also hear we're air-gapped or we were

253
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,120
air-gapped i mean most people especially

254
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
in ot that talk about air gap

255
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
actually have never seen an air gap

256
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,320
they

257
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
have they probably heard this term from

258
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,360
someone in the military or maybe applied

259
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,519
this in the military in some context and

260
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
now use it you know misconstrue it as to

261
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
what that means

262
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,240
most ot systems are very connect in fact

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
with convergence with all the network

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,800
integration that we have there are very

265
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,839
few places that are truly truly

266
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,000
but we also hear about the rules we

267
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
follow all the regulations and rules and

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,160
most times it's in the context of nur

269
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,320
except in power in the u.s for example

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
or some kind of security management

271
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,120
system

272
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,079
uh in the iso context however as you all

273
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,480
know compliance doesn't mean security

274
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,959
right not always for sure

275
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,880
and then this is my favorite we take

276
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,279
security seriously this is no different

277
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,360
from you know web apps saying we take

278
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
your privacy seriously whenever someone

279
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
says that you typically want to run away

280
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,440
because you know for a fact that they

281
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
actually don't right

282
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,200
so the real questions to be asked are

283
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,640
you know

284
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
did the incident really impact the

285
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,920
organization's primary business

286
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
objective i mean this is the key right

287
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,480
so the colonial pipeline was not able to

288
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
operate that's all matters whether the

289
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,880
systems that were affected yt systems or

290
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
ot systems it is important for people

291
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
that are mediating it but it's not

292
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,120
important for the average outsider

293
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
what's important is to answer this

294
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,120
question and is there an rto the

295
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
recovery time objective like how long

296
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,760
did you expect to be down and how long

297
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,519
uh you know will you be down before you

298
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,200
know you plan to come back up or did you

299
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
have a plan right

300
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,360
and was there any unacceptable impact on

301
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
personnel health safety and environment

302
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,959
i mean

303
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,279
hsc or safety environment and health

304
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,440
this has been critical for ot industrial

305
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,240
control systems for a long long time 30

306
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
plus years if not forever because you

307
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
know we had osha and all these rules in

308
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,240
the past few decades right

309
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
and here i quote sarah flux who's my

310
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
co-lead for the top 20 secure plc coding

311
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,959
practices project she says security and

312
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,200
safety of the common objective of making

313
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,360
systems more resilient and this

314
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,120
resiliency you hear this term quite a

315
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
bit in industrial controls that is key

316
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
if you have a resilience

317
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,519
plan or if you have a resilient

318
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,279
structure in place you'll be able to

319
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,680
come back up and most of these places do

320
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,920
have a plan right they might have a plan

321
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,519
for emergency preparedness they might

322
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
have a plan for uh something going wrong

323
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
with the equipment

324
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,880
they might not have a plan for cyber

325
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,720
related activities and we'll talk about

326
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,279
that for sure however

327
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,399
you can

328
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,160
improve the security aspect of an ot

329
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,800
system or an ot context

330
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
by by talking about safety because

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
safety and security have the same

332
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,680
objectives the methodologies in getting

333
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,360
to where you want to be

334
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,120
is different but the

335
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
concept and the goals are very similar

336
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,639
now bad news isn't always bad folks and

337
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,200
this is where i'm so excited to be in ot

338
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
granted i'm biased because i've always

339
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,639
been in industrial controls and ot has

340
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,160
been my background but those of you that

341
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,600
are considering you uh or or recently um

342
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
and moved into ot this is probably the

343
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,560
best time to be in ot right so just a

344
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
little bit of history lesson on the left

345
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,880
historically the upgrades in ics and ot

346
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,480
systems were primarily capital

347
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
expenditures so

348
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,519
25 years was not unheard of right every

349
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,399
20 25 years you have investments you put

350
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,079
together a few million dollar project

351
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,320
and you upgrade either a plant or a site

352
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,760
or maybe a whole complex and you then

353
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
you know leverage it for the next 20 25

354
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,320
years you know there is very little uh

355
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
annual maintenance plan

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
um maybe budget-wise right you still do

357
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
annual maintenance but very little

358
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,639
expenditure plan for the rest of the

359
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,800
cycle because that's how you did it that

360
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
was a history

361
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,519
and the engineers

362
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,839
that were coding in the ics world they

363
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,920
were trained in process controls and

364
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,320
safety not necessarily security because

365
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
that wasn't something that was important

366
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
for them back in the day or important

367
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
for anyone else right

368
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,399
and the ot solutions

369
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,320
they had limited support in actually

370
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,399
making a secure solution possible for

371
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,760
example the encryption and

372
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,680
authentication were missing at level

373
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,480
zero on level one in the purdue model

374
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,920
vendors wouldn't support all the

375
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,639
hardware that was secure so one vendor

376
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,720
might say we only tested our solution

377
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
with this fortnite switch and not the

378
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
other cisco switch

379
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,079
another vendor might say the opposite

380
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,519
right so if you wanted to implement

381
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,440
something that's secure based on your

382
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,959
risk assessment maybe that wasn't

383
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,560
supported

384
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,079
and then patching works very differently

385
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,320
in ot to a certain extent even today but

386
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,040
historically very much so

387
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
limited patch windows right you can only

388
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
take an outage in a plant every so often

389
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,600
maybe once a year in a power plant once

390
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,240
every few years in a refinery so you

391
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
don't want to

392
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
take any other outage because that's

393
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,720
tied to revenue

394
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,480
and then installing a patch might break

395
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,800
functionality which again you know you

396
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,440
lost a view lots of functionality and

397
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
nobody wants that and then the patch

398
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
might not be available and if available

399
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,079
it might not have been tested properly

400
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
again ties back to breaking

401
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,279
functionality

402
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,160
and then

403
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
this is very uniquely ot folks patch

404
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,320
might not reduce risk i mean again this

405
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,199
is historical um but it's true to a

406
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,279
certain extent today as well

407
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,360
because if you didn't have encryption

408
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
and authentication at this level zero

409
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,199
one what difference does it make if you

410
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,440
patch a level two hmi

411
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,360
but you're still able to send commands

412
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,120
to level zero on one let's say someone

413
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,880
got unauthorized access because of

414
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
credential stuffing or in secure remote

415
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,279
access this patch itself by itself could

416
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,199
not have mitigated the risk because

417
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
that's you know you're still able to

418
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,600
send commands to the plc and take over

419
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,639
right

420
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,480
and then asset inventory didn't exist i

421
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
mean i've never seen a good asset

422
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,040
inventory existing a few years ago uh

423
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,959
most of the places would have a vizio or

424
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,519
a cad diagram or a pdf that's very

425
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,279
static it doesn't really show exactly

426
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,360
what's in the plan right and if you

427
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,560
didn't know what you have on the plan

428
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,959
and how do you protect now like i

429
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,880
mentioned the exciting piece right

430
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
things have changed so risk-based

431
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
investments are happening you know a lot

432
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,040
of places have considered opex you are

433
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,560
seeing annual maintenance whether it's

434
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,199
for a patch management program or some

435
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,279
kind of vulnerability assessment program

436
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,800
you're seeing that up excellent

437
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
investment security awareness is

438
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,959
increasing at all levels folks not just

439
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,800
at the engineers not just not just the

440
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,920
users uh management is asking questions

441
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,680
uh the boards are asking questions the

442
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,160
government you know regional and and in

443
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,920
federal everywhere you're seeing this

444
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,600
awareness increasing

445
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,160
and uh most new platforms uh do have

446
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,000
security features you know level zero

447
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,399
level one level two they all have you

448
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,480
know a lot of security features that the

449
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,639
key there is to actually use them and

450
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,959
implement them properly and then secure

451
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,639
protocols you know this was an issue

452
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,880
back in the at level zero on one now we

453
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,560
do have protocols that can again

454
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,880
leverage uh better communication options

455
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,680
with encryption that's available

456
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,600
virtualization i mean this is a big deal

457
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,759
a few years ago

458
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,519
it was very hard to find a virtualized

459
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,480
hmi but now you have it in fact

460
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
even plcs are being virtualized so we're

461
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,199
getting a lot more support that way

462
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,959
it really helps in patch management if

463
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,120
everything is virtualized right and then

464
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,720
asset inventory and asset management

465
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,519
solutions we now have multiple vendors

466
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,519
that are competing in this space and

467
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,199
able to provide you

468
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,639
this asset inventory and asset

469
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,079
management options

470
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,639
in fact dale peterson who puts together

471
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,959
the s4 conference every year he's again

472
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,759
another luminaries of this ot space he

473
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,839
mentioned you know regarding ot security

474
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,759
companies that profit does not appear to

475
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,160
be an issue in ot security as it hasn't

476
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,839
been in much of i.t security because

477
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,439
there's a lot of growth a lot of these

478
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,119
solutions are coming from these you know

479
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,199
relatively new companies that are just

480
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,880
accelerating at a phenomenal pace

481
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,760
now the landscape is evolving um there

482
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,599
are a lot of regulations and directives

483
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,199
being thrown whether it's the tsa

484
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,359
directives after the colonial um

485
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,520
pipeline incident or the emergency

486
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,840
directors or scissors guidance there's

487
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
so much going on in terms of you know

488
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
asking for access controls improving

489
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,080
accountability finding a person that is

490
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,440
responsible for

491
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
um both reporting things as well as you

492
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
know getting things done right and then

493
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
this push towards network monitoring and

494
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
logging so that you know if something

495
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
were to happen at a particular site or a

496
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,000
particular industry uh that the rest of

497
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,919
the folks can um you know do something

498
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,240
about it like learn from it

499
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,559
standards too i didn't put everything in

500
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,320
there but either the isa isd62443

501
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,799
is now considered a horizontal standard

502
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,120
it's being applied in everything from

503
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
transportation oil and gas power

504
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,440
healthcare so we now have common

505
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
standards across ot that you can

506
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,840
leverage of course the csf from nist

507
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,160
again this is widely used i will talk a

508
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,600
little bit about the you know some of

509
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,240
the functions in detect in a little bit

510
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,360
but then we also have some cool

511
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,480
practices

512
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,280
the

513
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,840
cce methodology from inl uh the

514
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
consequence driven cyber informed

515
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,679
engineering kind of highlights the fact

516
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,760
that in ot space it's not all about

517
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,160
appending safety or security after the

518
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,400
fact but incorporating security as part

519
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
of your risk assessment as part of your

520
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
engineering to actually engineer a

521
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
secure solution right you also have

522
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,720
cyber pha which is a pro in a process

523
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,280
hazard analysis combined with cyber so

524
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,520
that you can leverage existing pha that

525
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,760
you've done for safety right and then

526
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,679
add cyber to it so that you're doing it

527
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,919
as part of your plant in a risk

528
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,120
assessment

529
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,640
and then i'm part of the secure plc

530
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,880
coding practices again trying to improve

531
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
coding practices for controllers at

532
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,880
level one uh so this is cool right like

533
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
he has so many new things happening

534
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,280
again at a pace maybe that's more ot

535
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,799
like you know it's not a galactical

536
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
place but still compared to what was 10

537
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,360
years ago and at quite a bit faster pace

538
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,160
than

539
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
other people expect

540
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,679
and then we also have you know if you're

541
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,200
a defender you know you have a lot more

542
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,799
threat intel products now available

543
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,880
customized roti a lot of visibility

544
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,360
tools anomaly detection we also have

545
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,440
minor attack for ics framework right and

546
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,120
then the ics kill chain

547
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
a lot of research being done on s-bomb

548
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
so that you know both vendors and

549
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,039
integrators are now you know they're

550
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,039
expecting regulations to come in but

551
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,720
more importantly they want to track

552
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,480
better right compared to what they you

553
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,559
know we're doing before um so a lot of

554
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,320
investment a lot of research going on in

555
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,559
s-bombs even in the ot space and of

556
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,520
course ics for ics this stands for in

557
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
you know instant command system for

558
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,360
industrial control systems

559
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,679
and uh megan sanford who leads this

560
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
effort uh her statement here for many

561
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,039
years we've needed ics for ics to enable

562
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,799
collectively organized cyber and

563
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,880
physical responses in a unified way

564
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,039
because in the industrial controls world

565
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,400
you know we can deal with physical

566
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,080
responses we deal with them all the time

567
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,000
you know when something happens like i

568
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
found a fire or you know in the gulf of

569
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,120
mexico maybe there's a hurricane we've

570
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,159
had plans to deal with this for a long

571
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,360
time so security can be added to that

572
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
planning so that it's now part of what

573
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
we do right that that way it's not

574
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
really something strange but something

575
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
that we do right

576
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,480
now low hanging fruit i mean this is

577
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
another um interesting piece of the

578
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,280
puzzle um in the it world these are

579
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,799
these are done right so these are

580
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,840
clearly

581
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
very basic and maybe you would have

582
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
already done it a long time ago however

583
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,480
in the ot world we still have them as a

584
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,799
low hanging fruit so a lot of places

585
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,320
don't have access and authentication

586
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,679
controls mfa is not implemented

587
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,919
you know for example that osmo florida

588
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,000
instance you know insecure remote access

589
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
and no mfa so pretty straightforward

590
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,559
credential stuffing situation boom

591
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,240
somebody has access right

592
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,480
it's not that difficult to open a system

593
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,120
that is vulnerable to basic stuff that

594
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
you know basic stuff is missing

595
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
similarly in the policies and procedures

596
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,120
you know renewable media usage you know

597
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,360
goes back to stuxnet world uh things

598
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,440
have improved but you know it's still

599
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
uh pretty common to see you know no

600
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,159
removal media policies or enforcements

601
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,480
and no logging right so no records of

602
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,880
things happening so how do you do

603
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
instant response when

604
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,799
you know you don't know what happened i

605
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,799
if you don't have any logs or alerts

606
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,039
then it's pretty hard so these things

607
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,600
can be incorporated pretty easily right

608
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,880
and then there are things that we can do

609
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,159
in ot that are not typically easy in i.t

610
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,720
so white listing for example is so much

611
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,799
easier in ot because we know exactly

612
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,120
what needs to work and what it takes for

613
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
the hmi or which device to communicate

614
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,520
to that plc and we can white list that

615
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,840
and it becomes very difficult

616
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,799
you know

617
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,280
the app is not on white listed it adds a

618
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,200
layer of complexity to the attack if

619
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,360
someone was targeting you uh but in the

620
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,760
it world this is a difficult task right

621
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,679
similarly network segmentation controls

622
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,440
and whether you use a

623
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,200
zone and conduit model or some other

624
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,080
model

625
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,679
it's a lot easier to segment the

626
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,240
networks in ot and manage them with the

627
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
appropriate risk because

628
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
you know these networks are

629
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,720
relatively static compared to all the

630
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,880
chatter that you see in the i.t world

631
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
and then this is another very

632
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,520
interesting thing in ot risk reduction

633
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
as we all know risk equals what

634
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,400
likelihood times impact or consequence

635
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,240
and instead of just focusing on the

636
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,880
likelihood in the ot space you can

637
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,840
actually

638
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
maybe more easily reduce the risk by

639
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,320
reducing the consequence or reducing the

640
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,520
impact

641
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,679
of an event versus focusing on the

642
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,600
likelihood that might be super expensive

643
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,799
and we'll talk a little bit more about

644
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,159
it in a sec

645
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,039
but again here i quote uh leslie carhart

646
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,480
uh you know she does a lot of instant

647
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,840
response

648
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,520
she said maybe your users aren't the

649
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,679
weakest link in security maybe you are

650
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,520
the weakest link in enabling your users

651
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
to do their mission securely so if

652
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,840
you're coming across these basics

653
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
missing in action ask yourself if you're

654
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
a security person or an i.t person

655
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,280
helping your other fellows

656
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
as to why it is right why are these

657
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,440
things missing and how can we get over

658
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,559
that hump maybe we can help them

659
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,919
so who is affected so this again unlike

660
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,280
in it where

661
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
maybe it's just an individual or a group

662
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,440
of individuals getting affected in the

663
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,080
ot space because of um you know the

664
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,919
critical infrastructure and the

665
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,120
components there are many many people uh

666
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,880
affected very difficult so within the

667
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
organizations you know management

668
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,960
employees and customers who are

669
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,799
different in many cases

670
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,039
with consumers and users think again

671
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,000
colonial pipeline the customers for

672
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
colonial pipeline might be in the

673
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
valeros or in other refineries of the

674
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,919
world but the users are the end users

675
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,120
right so these are the people that are

676
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,520
buying gasoline so customers are not

677
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,039
necessarily users in critical

678
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,559
infrastructure

679
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,640
so you might have these problems with

680
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,039
the organizations however for the users

681
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,039
maybe price and resource availability

682
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,120
you know those are maybe you know more

683
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,520
more of an issue right and of course

684
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,600
governments uh whenever something

685
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
happens whether it's um because of cyber

686
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,760
or something else you know think about

687
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,480
the taxes you know back in february the

688
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,640
great um relatively

689
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,559
unstable situation for a few days you

690
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,919
know people died um which was very sad

691
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,679
and then a lot a lot of people didn't

692
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,240
have power for quite some time and so

693
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,760
you might have civil unrest you know

694
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,039
we'll have cascading effects on the

695
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,760
economy uh besides of course you know

696
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,919
political adversaries uh trying to

697
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,159
leverage the situation so if your grid

698
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,720
for example is in that marginal state of

699
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,320
collapse you know if you're that close

700
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,880
to collapse uh maybe a cyber incident

701
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,279
can put it over right so there are

702
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,559
things that

703
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,720
ot security has to deal with that maybe

704
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,640
i.t security didn't have to

705
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,240
and of course media a lot of

706
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,640
sensationalism i mean every time there's

707
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,960
an ot related item or maybe an insecure

708
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,360
remote access they start with stuxnet i

709
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,679
mean it's like this classic bingo right

710
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,080
that you you can check off

711
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,440
why like we just want to know what

712
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,159
happened and no confusion um we don't

713
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,559
want anyone to say a sophisticated cyber

714
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,039
attack you know happen no insecurity

715
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,880
remote access is not sophisticated

716
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,640
insecure remote access has nothing to do

717
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,200
with stuxnet right but it's hardly ever

718
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
reported correctly so

719
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,360
and something to keep in mind

720
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,440
and then experts it's not that difficult

721
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,039
to find different opinions even though

722
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,400
they're all well intended

723
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,200
and i use um you know a few examples

724
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,840
here um you know if you're arguing about

725
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,720
gnu and linux being you know

726
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,679
different

727
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,279
if you're arguing about linux being a

728
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,000
kernel versus an operating system those

729
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,679
are for the experts the average user

730
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,200
doesn't care right so they just want to

731
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,360
use an operating system for them linux

732
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,840
means all of it right similarly these

733
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,679
experts sometimes will give you opinions

734
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,640
that are

735
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,240
not intended for the general audience

736
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,559
but then the media you know takes and

737
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,159
runs with it and then adds to more

738
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,360
confusion

739
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,960
and of course vendors and and

740
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,880
consultants we talk about how they're

741
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,360
growing fast uh but sometimes it's horse

742
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
before the cart you know if you're

743
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,559
selling a detection product or if you're

744
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,640
selling instant response but they don't

745
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,559
have asset inventory then

746
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,120
you know it's horse before the cart

747
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
insurance providers sometimes are

748
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,799
pushing for best practices otherwise

749
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,400
they're not you know insuring and

750
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,320
sometimes they're excluding

751
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,080
ot because they don't know how to deal

752
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,600
with it right

753
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,880
sarah freeman who co-authored the cce um

754
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,799
book actually mentions this i need to

755
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,480
change how people think about managing

756
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,760
security uh and it's true because uh ot

757
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,200
security especially and it has to be

758
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,279
managed in an engineering fashion not

759
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,039
necessarily the same as it right

760
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,679
let's go a little um faster in the last

761
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,080
couple slides a quick reality check i

762
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,520
mean i mentioned it's an exciting time

763
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,840
to be in ot

764
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
but ot is a vague term but cyber

765
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,520
physical technology are pervasive right

766
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,440
so they're all over the place but the

767
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,520
different verticals leads to you know

768
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,120
different compliance regimens different

769
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,880
requirements and different impacts you

770
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,559
know what happens if a power plant comes

771
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,480
down is very different from what happens

772
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,279
when a pipeline comes down so

773
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,760
not all ot is the same right a lot of

774
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,279
common work being done like i mentioned

775
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,600
before uh with the standards and and the

776
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,880
regulations

777
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,320
um but ot is different in it to it in

778
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,200
many ways so many security solutions

779
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
need to be maybe customized or maybe

780
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,760
implemented uniquely uh but not

781
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
everything has to be has to be new right

782
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,440
so there are some proven iq solutions

783
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,640
that we can

784
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,440
fit or adapt instead of reinventing the

785
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,000
wheel for ot and in other times we can

786
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,919
just use an extension of process safety

787
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,919
or emergency preparedness whether it's

788
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,159
with the cyber pha or the ics for ics to

789
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,399
improve ot security versus having to you

790
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
know do something new right and then

791
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,399
it's meaningless for organizations to

792
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,960
focus on ot risk and i.t risk separately

793
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,799
because what matters is business risk

794
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,679
whether it's from ot rit

795
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,080
and then ransomware just affecting i.t

796
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,279
systems or someone saying oh these ot

797
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
systems were not attacked it's not

798
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,039
relevant right the key is if the

799
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,399
business can't function due to an

800
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,600
incident then

801
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,960
that's your problem right that's the

802
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,320
business problem

803
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,399
so here i quote daniel you know who

804
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,000
mentions not compromising security

805
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,520
requirements when making purchasing

806
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,080
decisions again if you just do what you

807
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,159
did 20 years ago in the ot space bought

808
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,840
the same kind of equipment wanted the

809
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,760
same functionality and just you know

810
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,440
have this tunnel vision then you're

811
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,880
going to miss the point about improving

812
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,240
ot security in the 20th and 21st century

813
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,600
and and do what is required right

814
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
and then we still have a few open

815
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,799
questions right especially if you don't

816
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,039
have compliance requirements uh or if

817
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,399
you only have directives you know

818
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,919
whether it's in healthcare or in

819
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,399
pipelines or in water for example

820
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,520
wastewater where there are no compliance

821
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,080
requirements or not as many as in the

822
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,240
power sector in the us for example uh

823
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,000
where do you start right you start with

824
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
personnel and training i mean this is

825
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,360
the first and foremost thing like you

826
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,039
train your ot people if you train your

827
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,080
ics people um that's the best bang for

828
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,440
your buck when you're beginning your

829
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,679
program right and then you identify in

830
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,840
this you know this csf that i mentioned

831
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,039
you know there are many things that you

832
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,360
can do but start with identifying your

833
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,679
asset inventory and do a risk assessment

834
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,360
of where you are so you can track your

835
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,039
maturity over time

836
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,960
and then leverage industry groups and

837
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,799
obviously the water associations the

838
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,559
water ice acts of the world for water

839
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,440
industry similarly for oil and gas you

840
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
know there is an ice act these days for

841
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,360
every critical infrastructure or you can

842
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,760
cross-collaborate with other ice axe

843
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,919
and of course cesar in the us and i'm in

844
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,679
vancouver canada you know we have our

845
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,320
equivalent cyber security center

846
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,399
governments are you know providing a lot

847
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,320
of information that you can leverage

848
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
establish a disaster recovery policy and

849
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,399
the recovery time objectives that you

850
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,240
can then track if you're able to meet

851
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,080
your goals or not like if you don't have

852
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,679
a goal if you don't have a destination

853
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,840
in mind you'll never get there right and

854
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,760
do a tabletop exercise or instant

855
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
response exercise to actually check and

856
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,080
make sure that your backups are working

857
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,039
or if you're able to meet your rto

858
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,640
obviously you can never especially in

859
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
the o2 world you cannot outsource

860
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,799
instant response 100 there's no way

861
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,520
because those people need to be aware of

862
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,000
your plan your situation your network

863
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,640
and only your people can be right so

864
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,000
you can have a retainer with a third

865
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,240
party but you have to be part of that ir

866
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
and then post incident you know

867
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,880
obviously you know you need to have a

868
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,559
trigger that says yep this is an instant

869
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,240
we have to do something about it but

870
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,919
then there are other open questions you

871
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,080
know to pay or not to pay uh some

872
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,679
countries are actually making it illegal

873
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,919
to pay ransom

874
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:52,960
and

875
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,320
even if you paid and you got the

876
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,159
recovery key let's say you know there's

877
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,399
no guarantee that it'll work and even if

878
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,480
that works and the data recovery might

879
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,360
take uh much longer than your rto right

880
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
so if it's not reasonable then you know

881
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,840
what's the point why pay um you know

882
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,679
because you should have other plans

883
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,640
other mitigation uh in place uh because

884
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,360
your

885
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,080
rto uh is much lower and you'll not be

886
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,519
able to come back up in this reasonable

887
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,840
time period so here i quote maggie

888
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,320
morganti she says you know security of

889
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,399
ics has global effects and requires a

890
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,480
global security mindset here she's

891
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,240
talking about security vendors and

892
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,000
integrators with this you know global

893
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,519
reach right products that go around the

894
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,760
world uh because yes you know whether

895
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,919
you're siemens or ge or schneider

896
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,760
electric or any of these big companies

897
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,000
that have products embedded in ot

898
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
systems around the world uh it is a

899
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,679
global issue right if something were to

900
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,880
happen in one country and then cascading

901
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,480
effects happen in other countries

902
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,919
because of critical infrastructure

903
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,000
failures that's a problem for everybody

904
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,279
so

905
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,679
that's all i have folks uh i'm happy to

906
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,360
