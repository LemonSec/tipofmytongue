2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,599
[Music]

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,239
[Music]

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,439
okay so uh hello everyone uh huge thank

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,320
you to grim khan for having me um happy

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
to be here the speakers are amazing so

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,359
i'm just happy to be here uh so i think

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,119
my topic might be a little bit different

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,199
today from some of the technical type

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,600
stuff i'm going to be talking about

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,280
integrating behavioral analysis

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,760
techniques into cyber security programs

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,239
and sort of talking about implications

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,399
of behavior and what it means to

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,879
different teams and

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,920
so let's go ahead and get started

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,039
okay so by day i'm a security architect

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,399
at ibm i work in the ciso's office for

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,480
the security innovation and remediation

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,440
team or seer as we call ourselves

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
uh by night i'm an adjunct professor i'm

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,520
also a doctoral chair so chairing

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,959
doctoral students

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,520
and i do have as mentioned uh two

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,320
doctorates uh dsc in cyber security

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,640
where i focused on studying

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,400
vulnerability scoring and vulnerability

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,119
chaining and so for another day if you'd

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
love for me to just like

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,880
talk for hours about vulnerability

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,159
scoring and vulnerability chaining

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,000
that'd be happy to do that too

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,799
uh

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,520
then the uh phd in human factors

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,439
i was studying still vulnerability

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,119
chaining but from a terminology aspect

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:33,840
so

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
understanding how vulnerability chaining

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,159
the phenomenon of sort of

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,960
uh how we remediate vulnerabilities how

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,640
we view vulnerabilities in combination

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,399
whether or not we do that if that's a

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,320
phenomenon um

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,079
my dissertation was just published in

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
proquest so again if you have just

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,640
several hours to waste reading a really

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,040
long document um it's on proquest if

48
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,280
you're interested uh i do come from a

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
background in i.t operations i was in

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,000
itops for about 12 years 11 12 years

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,680
before i moved into security about three

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,119
years ago

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:05,920
and

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,119
part of what we're going to be talking

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,119
about today is why i made the shift into

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,599
cyber security from it

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,239
i have a real soft spot in my heart for

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,800
vulnerability management uh for

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,120
from the i.t side from the cyber side i

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
know how challenging it can be so i i

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,040
really like to study that and and sort

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,319
of figure out how to solve some of those

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,560
challenges i love risk management and

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
then dfir is just a total passion uh

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,239
thing for me

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
all right so quick disclaimer all

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,599
thoughts feelings views in this

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,200
presentation are my own they do not

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
reflect any of my employers have to say

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,239
that

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,519
and also since we're talking about

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,840
behavioral analysis i am not a trained

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,519
psychologist i'm not a trained therapist

74
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,760
i do not have a degree in that

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,440
but i do love to

76
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
research and i love to see how

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,319
a lot of the

78
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,879
research concepts phenomenon that we see

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,640
in psychology can sort of help us

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,000
improve what we're doing in cyber

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,599
security as practitioners

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,400
okay

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,200
so

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,959
to break it down we're going to start

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,760
with

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
some of the current challenges in cyber

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,920
security uh it's going to lay the ground

88
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,280
fork for

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
uh what is behavioral analysis anyway

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,640
what do i what are you talking about why

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
are we talking about this uh sort of

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
what techniques are available and then

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
how is that going to tie us into cyber

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
security and some of the teams different

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,720
types of teams within cyber security um

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,000
how he can sort of apply those

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,319
techniques in a practical way because i

98
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,840
think that's the best thing about you

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,120
know getting an opportunity to speak

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,319
about uh topics like this is to give

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,000
anybody in the audience some actionable

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
takeaways something you can actually

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,200
tangibly do so

104
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,440
let's go ahead and get started

105
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,400
all right solarwinds

106
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,480
log for jay i realized i typed cough

107
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
there but i just wanted to cough

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,519
as well

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,879
uh

110
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,519
we are constantly dealing with an

111
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,360
onslaught of new types of

112
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,159
vulnerabilities new types of exploits

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,680
new and fun ways for the hackers

114
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
malicious actors to

115
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,760
infiltrate our networks and and

116
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,000
ultimately you know compromise our

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
systems whether it's with ransomware

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,959
malware

119
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
whatever it might be ddos gosh that

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,478
takes down stuff all the time um so

121
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,000
there's uh

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,520
there's really this

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,240
this need for us to

124
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
look at these challenges look at these

125
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,320
problems in a different way like

126
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
ultimately that's why i think

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
talking about behavioral analysis

128
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,800
talking about perception cognition

129
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
different psychological sort of concepts

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,160
is a different way for us to look at

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,240
some of these problems

132
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
i don't think i'm seeing anything too

133
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,720
crazy here when i say that uh annual

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,120
cyber security training is

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
in its the way that i've seen it

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
it's not that effective you know if we

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
train people once a year

138
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,440
it's really hard to say

139
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,800
you know what are they doing on a daily

140
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
basis and do they remember the training

141
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,080
if they took it six months ago do they

142
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
remember what the training said i know i

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,720
don't uh you know i but i do cyber

144
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,800
security every day so i get to sort of

145
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
see what's going on on a day-to-day

146
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
basis whereas you know a lot of general

147
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
users don't it's just it's not a part of

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
their necessarily a part of their job or

149
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
something they think about all the time

150
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,880
they've got lots of other things going

151
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,840
on

152
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,680
uh and this is where i wanted to bring

153
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,479
in the idea of cognitive limitations too

154
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,000
you know we've got phishing tests we've

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
got annual cyber training we've got

156
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,720
uh communication for security

157
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
assessments and audits we've got new

158
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,280
frameworks all this complexity added

159
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
into all of our cyber security programs

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,039
and that's just what we're doing in

161
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,600
cyber that's not to mention how our

162
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
users are sort of trying to digest all

163
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,919
this information that you know they

164
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,440
might not be technical that just might

165
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
not be part of you know what they do or

166
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,360
what they were trained in

167
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,639
and so

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,240
how can we

169
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,840
sort of twofold

170
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
how can we help our users

171
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,319
um you know not punish them or make them

172
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,319
feel bad about it but how can we help

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,800
them how can we make security easier for

174
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,759
them and then how can we as security

175
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,880
practitioners do a better job of

176
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,360
detection proactive security all of that

177
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
good stuff

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,199
and not just that from a technical sense

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,639
how can we work better as teams how can

180
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,520
we

181
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,479
um improve our own skill sets and and do

182
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,560
what we do best even better uh because

183
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
types of attacks and the amount of

184
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,400
information that's coming at us all the

185
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
time you know there's only so much that

186
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,440
we can ingest which is cognitive

187
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,960
limitations you know there's only so

188
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,840
much information that we can take in and

189
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,120
and really

190
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
uh put back into the work that we use

191
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,680
you know if i read about 12 to 15

192
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
different types of vulnerabilities a day

193
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,680
how much of that information can i

194
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,440
integrate you know into my daily job

195
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,599
since i'm in cyber security probably a

196
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,560
lot

197
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
but how much would an average user be

198
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,240
able to digest that information along

199
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,599
with all the other things that they need

200
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,360
to know for their own jobs you know it

201
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,360
gets sort of difficult so um with that

202
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,280
uh what is behavioral analysis uh what

203
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,560
are we talking about

204
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
so

205
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
in a nutshell uh

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
how do people behave

207
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,360
uh the field of behavioral analysis and

208
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
and people that work in this this field

209
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,520
they want to understand how people

210
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,960
uh work together

211
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
how do they

212
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
so for an athlete for example

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,479
especially high level athletes you know

214
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,360
when a second or a millisecond can make

215
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
the difference between winning or losing

216
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,919
uh how can you change someone's behavior

217
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,919
to help them improve

218
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,160
their ability um

219
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,720
how can you change someone's sort of

220
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,759
patterns the way they do things uh sort

221
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,440
of the the things that they do on a

222
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
daily basis how can you change that to

223
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,039
help them prove what they're already

224
00:07:59,039 --> 00:07:59,919
doing

225
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,599
um you think about having like a bad

226
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,759
habit like uh biting your nails or

227
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,039
something like that like how do we

228
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
change that behavior so that you're not

229
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,039
always biting your nails uh that's like

230
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,680
a really nice easy example about of

231
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,520
behavioral analysis

232
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,039
and

233
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,680
people who do this in as a profession

234
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
and as their daily job

235
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,960
they have to really be able to

236
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,479
look at

237
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,599
physical

238
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,800
emotional

239
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
you know these these sort of really

240
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,440
biological things that a human is doing

241
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,519
and i think one of the reasons why i

242
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,039
think this is such an important topic

243
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,360
for cyber security specifically is that

244
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,839
sometimes we lose the human in what

245
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,919
we're doing you know that people process

246
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,279
technology concept that we're always

247
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,720
talking about

248
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
um

249
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
we don't always talk about people as

250
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
human beings you know we say users or

251
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,519
administrators or analysts or malicious

252
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,480
actors

253
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,640
you know we don't think about the real

254
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,399
human that's behind there and i'll get

255
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,760
into this in a little bit you know red

256
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,880
teams it's a little bit different

257
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,000
because when you're doing social

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
engineering you're sort of you really

259
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,760
have to understand how people operate in

260
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,519
a technical space

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,040
you know this is more about

262
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
environmental factors as far as

263
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,680
behavioral analysis goes um

264
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
so you can sort of understand how

265
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
someone is working in their physical

266
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
environment

267
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
and how that may change the way that

268
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,240
they behave the way that they act and

269
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,000
the way that they ultimately would do or

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,519
do not do things

271
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,360
that are beneficial to them

272
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,080
so

273
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,680
health fitness all of that good stuff

274
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,480
quickly i wanted to touch on there are

275
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,920
three different types of behavioral

276
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,680
analysis just sort of top level things

277
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,600
that i wanted to discuss there's the

278
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,200
conceptual the experimental and the

279
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,600
applied the applied behavioral analysis

280
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
is specifically what i'm talking about

281
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,399
today

282
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
so conceptual this is like very

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,480
philosophical you know thinking about

284
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,959
things and and really

285
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,120
uh sort of studying from a theoretical

286
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
standpoint you know how do we think that

287
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,920
this works

288
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
um very useful and helpful but just not

289
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,320
what i want to talk about here

290
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
experimental you know this is really

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,760
just research this is really research

292
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,640
based

293
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,200
and uh this takes me to

294
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,720
one of my other big points that i wanted

295
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,360
to bring up as sort of i go through this

296
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,120
there isn't a lot of

297
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,360
i see this sometimes but there isn't a

298
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,240
lot of academic research that gets used

299
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,519
in a

300
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,600
technical practical way like on a

301
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,920
day-to-day basis i use research because

302
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,839
i you know did that with my dissertation

303
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,680
and with you know being a professor but

304
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,440
it's not something that i typically see

305
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,279
people like oh man i want to read this

306
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,959
academic journal this computer science

307
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,480
ieee or acm journal you know that may

308
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,200
have the latest research um you know in

309
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
in a practical or like a technical

310
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
environment

311
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,399
and then here when we're talking about

312
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,120
applied uh behavioral analysis this is

313
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,240
really

314
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,200
promoting behavioral change so

315
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,399
there are a couple of different again a

316
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,440
couple of different ways that you can do

317
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
this but actually

318
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,760
watching someone how they behave how

319
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,000
they act the things that they do that

320
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,160
might be positive or negative impacts on

321
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
their own life and then how do you

322
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,519
change that behavior so like someone who

323
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,920
smokes and wants to quit uh how can you

324
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,120
help them

325
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,480
you know quit smoking if that's what

326
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,680
they what they want to do

327
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
so this is what i was sort of alluding

328
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
to this discrete trial training versus

329
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,760
the natural environment training there's

330
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
a couple different ways that behavioral

331
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,200
analysis uh um you know psychologists

332
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
and therapists that that they do this

333
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
that they help to change behavior in

334
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,000
people

335
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,839
so uh one of the ways this discrete

336
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,440
trial training

337
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,519
you're really breaking down

338
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,160
complex behavior so it wouldn't just be

339
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,760
it may not be

340
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,600
smoking or something like that it may be

341
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
something rooted in

342
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,279
you know um something that happened in

343
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
someone's childhood or you know like a

344
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,200
fear of spiders or something like that

345
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,279
like i i don't know i'm not i mean okay

346
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,279
i'm definitely scared of spiders uh but

347
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,440
yeah so how do you break down that

348
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
complex fear that maybe has been built

349
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,839
up over years and years and years but

350
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,440
might be negatively impacting someone's

351
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,639
life

352
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,399
so how do you reward someone how do you

353
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,040
change the way that they do things um

354
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
versus natural environment training

355
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,160
where there's you're not

356
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,600
saying to someone you need to change

357
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,120
this behavior now and i'm gonna tell you

358
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,399
how to do it

359
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,560
you are waiting until someone is you

360
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,920
know someone would go to the therapist

361
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,240
and say okay i am tired of being scared

362
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,320
of spiders you know i run out of my

363
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
house every time i see one i can't do

364
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,399
this anymore i need help uh where the

365
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,440
therapist would then help them to

366
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,720
gradually

367
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
you know introduce the concept of

368
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,000
spiders maybe talk about it and then

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,320
maybe show pictures and then maybe do a

370
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,000
physical demonstration with a spider and

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,600
then maybe have them hold the spider

372
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
things like that where it's this really

373
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,480
gradual

374
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,880
gentle sort of way of changing someone's

375
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,959
behavior

376
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,639
and the idea is that you're hopefully

377
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,800
changing the way that they do things on

378
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
a daily basis

379
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
this is really what i'm talking about

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,440
here in regards to cyber security is

381
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,959
and we're going to get into a little bit

382
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,279
more more deeply but

383
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,160
how can we evaluate what we are doing on

384
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
a day-to-day basis and whether it's us

385
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,639
as cyber security practitioners or our

386
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,040
users or our user population whatever it

387
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,000
might be

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
uh the different groups that we work

389
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,720
with

390
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,279
how can we understand their behavior to

391
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,839
ultimately help them change it so if i

392
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,320
know that annual cybersecurity training

393
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,000
is not necessarily changing the

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
cybersecurity habits

395
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,600
of my users

396
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,560
what can i do to better help them

397
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
is it a nudge

398
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,760
is it an alert is it a face-to-face

399
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
meeting with them to talk with them and

400
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
introduce myself as a cyber security

401
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,880
professional something like that where

402
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,639
you start to say what are some of the

403
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,560
other things that i can potentially do

404
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,639
to help my users and maybe some of my

405
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,720
users that really cyber security does

406
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
not come easy to them

407
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,360
how can i start to change those

408
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,920
behaviors

409
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,160
so quickly because i'm in academia too i

410
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
had to talk about the latest research i

411
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
will not bore you guys to tears with you

412
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,639
know what all of these things are but i

413
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,880
did want to put some references up here

414
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,480
and some resources up here because i

415
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
wanted to talk about sort of what's

416
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,320
going on in behavioral analysis research

417
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,800
right now

418
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,440
in behavioral analysis they're talking

419
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,639
about a lot of the same things that we

420
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,920
talk about in cyber security in it ot

421
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,680
machine learning how can machine

422
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,680
learning how can ai help us sort of do

423
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,600
how can it help us change our behaviors

424
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,480
how can it help us learn maybe what what

425
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
we need to change you know maybe it's

426
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
not as simple as like oh i see i'm doing

427
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,399
this one task repeatedly in the same way

428
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,920
and i'm not getting you know i'm not

429
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
making this any better

430
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,480
maybe this tool can help me understand

431
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,320
that this same behavior that i'm doing

432
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,160
is not effective and it's not helpful

433
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
and i need to change that

434
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,760
um and then uh i just quickly wanted to

435
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,120
talk about this

436
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
uh probably because i think we're

437
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,760
probably all very familiar with social

438
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
media at this point but there's a lot of

439
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
behavioral analysis

440
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,839
that has really since technology is i

441
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,360
mean it's what we use all the time all

442
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,720
day every day

443
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
whether it's our laptop or tablet or

444
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
phone whatever it is

445
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,519
there is a lot of behavioral analysis

446
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,079
work that's being done on how social

447
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,120
media how technology impacts how we

448
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,079
um

449
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,399
how we function as humans right you know

450
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,360
because there's there's a lot of

451
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,680
research on technology addiction things

452
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,959
like that

453
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,399
which isn't what i'm talking about here

454
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,120
but

455
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,079
more so that there is a lot of the same

456
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,519
types of problems that they're seeing in

457
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,959
behavioral analysis that we're seeing in

458
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,120
cyber security with the way that people

459
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,399
keep doing the same things over and over

460
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
again so if we can start to understand

461
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,480
the behavior what why people are doing

462
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,399
what they're doing then we can change

463
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,160
that behavior and use positive

464
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
reinforcement or help people

465
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,279
to learn sort of better ways of handling

466
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,920
situations

467
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,639
all right so what in the world does this

468
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,639
have to do with cyber security

469
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,560
um you know i mentioned it sort of at

470
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
the top of this but

471
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,519
cyber attacks happen the same way that

472
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,120
they've been happening for a long long

473
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,839
time uh phishing attacks are still huge

474
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,759
i it was funny i heard someone the other

475
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,440
day mentioned that they're like oh you

476
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,800
know fishing i'm not as worried about

477
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,720
phishing attacks and i was like really i

478
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,000
was like there's still like sixty

479
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,839
percent i can't remember what this the

480
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,560
latest statistic was from one of the um

481
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,160
one of the reports from like verizon the

482
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,639
data breach report but like the phishing

483
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
attacks are still super high and when

484
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,720
you think about how these types of

485
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,959
attacks can happen like ransomware and

486
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,199
how devastating they can be if it

487
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,440
happens because of a phishing attack but

488
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,519
they're super devastating um you know

489
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,199
i'm still concerned about phishing and

490
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,040
how we can help our users you know not

491
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
click on that link or not download that

492
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,959
that file you know that word file

493
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,959
whatever it might be um

494
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,800
and we have a hard time

495
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,920
you know

496
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,120
stopping them

497
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
you know users need to have

498
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,440
uh access to certain websites they have

499
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
to have access to applications

500
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
so it's sort of this how can we help

501
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,160
change user behavior to help them

502
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
understand that certain

503
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,039
uh certain things that you click on

504
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
will always be you know a concern it

505
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,559
will always be a concerning thing you

506
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,079
know it's about changing mindset and

507
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,599
changing behavior

508
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
um you know cyber attacks can go months

509
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
or years without being detected

510
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,039
why is that you know how how is it

511
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,039
that we maybe our alerts aren't set up

512
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,840
properly maybe we are unable to detect

513
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,039
them because

514
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,480
you know the technology doesn't exist

515
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,080
yet for us to detect them maybe we

516
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,840
weren't looking out for this

517
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
maybe you know it could be any number of

518
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,320
factors right but the idea is that

519
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,480
um you know we have to understand as

520
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,039
especially cyber security practitioners

521
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,840
um

522
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,679
so many different types of attacks so

523
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,360
many different threats all the time that

524
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
we are you know take this log for jay

525
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
right there was another patch released i

526
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,799
think a day or two ago

527
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,919
and it's going to be something that's

528
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,640
going to continue to evolve that is one

529
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
product well not one product because

530
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
it's in multiple products but do you

531
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,520
mean it's one

532
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,240
exploits one type of explain and think

533
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,000
about how many

534
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
exploits are happening in the wild right

535
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,720
now how many apt groups out there are

536
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,400
you know targeting certain types of

537
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,559
industry uh you know like if you're in

538
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,080
the financial sector you've got a whole

539
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,440
other world of things you have to worry

540
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,640
about

541
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
and so

542
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,000
uh the point is there's so much

543
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,520
complexity with what we do every day

544
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,960
and if we can start to understand

545
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
what where our problems really are and

546
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,799
have those hard conversations i think

547
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,240
that's another really important point i

548
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,919
want to make sometimes it's a hard

549
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,480
conversation about you know

550
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,039
introspection what did i how did i

551
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,280
handle this situation could i have

552
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
handled it differently could i have

553
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,039
communicated more effectively because i

554
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
think we talk about like well

555
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,799
you know there was this alert

556
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,320
it was this ip it was this thing it was

557
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,600
this it was that

558
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,280
how about how we're communicating how

559
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,559
about how we're talking with other

560
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
people did i handle that well could i

561
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,720
have said it in a different way that

562
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
would have been more meaningful for that

563
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,480
individual um so sort of empathy

564
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,640
understanding collaboration all those

565
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,160
things that sort of come together that

566
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
can actually make us really more

567
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
effective as cyber security teams

568
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,880
um

569
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,760
because if we have certain behaviors or

570
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,679
certain patterns of behavior it could

571
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,400
potentially negatively impact the

572
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,480
security of a program and i'm not just

573
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,840
speaking about security practitioners

574
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
i'm speaking about anybody if we have

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,919
bad habits or bad behaviors or things

576
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,039
like that

577
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,200
like let's say for example if i'm if i'm

578
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,720
playing candy crush for eight hours a

579
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
day on my work computer um that's a

580
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,360
pretty bad habit and not just for me and

581
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,440
my work ethic and what i need to be

582
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
doing as an employee that's really bad

583
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
for the security posture of

584
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,360
the network because what if a malicious

585
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
ad pops up on my candy crush game and i

586
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,640
click on it

587
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
so uh so i think it's about starting to

588
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
help people understand that certain

589
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,120
behaviors have security consequences

590
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,039
so i wanted to talk a little bit about a

591
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,480
couple of different

592
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,320
teams i don't obviously have time to get

593
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
into all of them today but i wanted to

594
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,480
talk about a couple

595
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,360
so as a blue teamer uh

596
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,039
how are we training habits into blue

597
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,600
teams so as someone that comes from it

598
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
operations i have a very good

599
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,159
understanding of how systems work

600
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,200
together

601
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,600
what the typical day of an it operations

602
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,440
group looks like an engineer or an

603
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,360
administrator or you know an it

604
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,120
architect infrastructure you know

605
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,559
whatever it might be

606
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,320
um i sort of understand what the day to

607
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,000
day looks like

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
that helps me have empathy and

609
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,880
understanding for the it groups that i

610
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,679
work with now on the security side so

611
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,039
you know when i go

612
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,280
talk with someone who is you know hey

613
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,799
i've got vulnerabilities and i need to

614
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,720
fix them and i don't know what to do

615
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,559
instead of me saying well gosh you're

616
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,080
really going to need to figure that out

617
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,280
i can say

618
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
okay let's take these one at a time

619
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
let's prioritize these let's see what we

620
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,120
can do to make your life a little bit

621
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,640
easier if i can help provide more

622
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
information or if you're stuck or if you

623
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
can't apply this control or fix this

624
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,280
vulnerability what can i help you do to

625
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,000
mitigate what can i help you do to apply

626
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
something some other sort of control so

627
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,159
that way we know we're at least adding

628
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,159
some sort of security into your

629
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,440
environment

630
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
um so

631
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
as far as behaviors go having that

632
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,280
empathy and understanding um can really

633
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,200
change the interaction between it groups

634
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,159
um

635
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,480
burnout burnout is another thing as far

636
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
as you know behavioral analysis goes

637
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,880
if you're in a sock if you're working in

638
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,400
an operations and it operations

639
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,679
environment too

640
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,400
if you're working 24 7 and especially

641
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,240
you know i have so much empathy for

642
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,919
anyone that's working on all the log4j

643
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,320
stuff right now because it can be that

644
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,159
can be a full-time job and that means

645
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,760
that all the other things that you're

646
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,120
supposed to be working on sort of fall

647
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
by the wayside or you have to work extra

648
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,480
hours to do that

649
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
um

650
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,559
so how can we help to identify

651
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,280
burnout how can we identify the patterns

652
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,799
of behavior that come with someone who

653
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,799
is starting to get burnout so we can

654
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,440
help them so how can i help someone who

655
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,679
i see you struggling or i see is having

656
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,080
a hard time um

657
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,120
and then

658
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
how can

659
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,320
uh how can i help

660
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,799
my sock how can i help

661
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,799
manage if i'm managing alerts as a

662
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,280
security engineer managing our tools

663
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,600
how can i automate how can i change the

664
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,919
way that i do things day-to-day how many

665
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,480
manual tasks do i have versus automated

666
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,039
so how can i change the behavior of what

667
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,039
we're doing as a team because if i see

668
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,640
someone doing the same manual task every

669
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
day i'm going to be like yeah let's

670
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,520
we're going to create a script we're

671
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,120
going to automate that we're taking that

672
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,720
off your table because

673
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,400
that needs to burn out that leads to

674
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,799
people leaving their jobs and

675
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,720
you know turnover which is never good

676
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,559
for a security program especially if

677
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,480
someone had a lot of knowledge

678
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,440
um

679
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,520
uh specific to

680
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,120
that role and it wasn't written down

681
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,200
that's never good for a company so

682
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,120
or a security team so

683
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,799
how can we start to change the way that

684
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,760
we do things even within our sock so

685
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,200
that we can

686
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
um help the people that are you know

687
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,919
looking at 5000 alerts a day or

688
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,200
just constantly looking at network

689
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
traffic and so how what can we do to

690
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,840
sort of help

691
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,320
them um and then red teams i think

692
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,080
a lot of people that at least that i've

693
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,960
met that are you know ethical hackers

694
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,919
they do penetration tests um

695
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,240
they do understand a lot of the behavior

696
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,120
of

697
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,720
users

698
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,679
but in the way that how can i

699
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,159
how can i exploit how can i

700
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,559
what vulnerabilities can i use how can i

701
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,200
leverage what i have to create an attack

702
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,720
and then to ultimately you know provide

703
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,880
it to a blue team or provide it to you

704
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,320
know a company and say hey here's your

705
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,840
gaps and here's what you need to fix and

706
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,080
here's how to fix it um

707
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
but you know does that include

708
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,960
empathy i don't know maybe it does but

709
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,880
that's a question right like is that

710
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,000
part of the behavior that we have or is

711
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,880
it a technical exercise that i say i'm

712
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,159
going to test these 15 controls and see

713
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,760
if i can get in okay i can't get in that

714
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,799
way i'm going to try a different way i'm

715
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,240
going to try a different way is it a

716
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,919
technical exercise or is it a human

717
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,200
exercise

718
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,600
so i think as far as

719
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,559
looking at habits looking at behaviors

720
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,679
how

721
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,840
are you looking at the network is it

722
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
from a

723
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
purely technical

724
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,039
social engineering like i'm just going i

725
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,520
just need to break in however i can

726
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
or is there some sort of you know is

727
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
there another behavior or a pattern

728
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,480
that's going on that maybe inhibits

729
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,279
what's going on you know if um

730
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,480
if for example

731
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
like uh

732
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,960
uh pen pen test teams red teams that

733
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,720
i've seen they're so good at persistence

734
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,080
they have so much persistence

735
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,400
determination the ability to

736
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
just say you know what this isn't

737
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,039
working i'm going to try this instead

738
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,200
i'm going to try this instead

739
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
what if we could take that mindset that

740
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,440
determination that persistence

741
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
maybe that's a good behavior that we

742
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,000
want to integrate into other teams how

743
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,880
can we take that good behavior and help

744
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
other teams understand this type of

745
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,640
persistence this type of you know

746
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,039
determination to get something done

747
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,679
um so maybe it's a teachable thing maybe

748
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,440
it's not a negative thing but a positive

749
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,960
thing that we can help teach to other

750
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,120
people so again just another

751
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,480
consideration but for a different team

752
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,159
uh devsecops

753
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:34,960
so

754
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,840
you know for a security engineer or

755
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
anyone who's working with development

756
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,720
teams

757
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,559
i think there's this sort of um

758
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,279
it can be difficult to

759
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,960
uh understand if you're coming in from a

760
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,559
purely security perspective and you're

761
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,679
coming in and working with a team of

762
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,799
developers

763
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,559
what are the habits that are going on

764
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,799
what what what sort of behaviors have

765
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,200
sort of been adapted or have changed

766
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,360
over time within the development team

767
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,960
uh you know do they have a lot of

768
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
pressure on them to just get things done

769
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,679
really quickly

770
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,760
were they trained in security did they

771
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,440
even when you know when they were going

772
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,000
through whether it was a university

773
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
program or through training was security

774
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,760
taught to them were they taught to write

775
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,440
secure code or were they taught to write

776
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,320
code quickly efficiently and get it done

777
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,919
you know so it's it's sort of that

778
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,559
question too i think of of what habits

779
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,400
do they have

780
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,799
is it the habit or the mentality to code

781
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,480
securely or is that something we need to

782
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,600
help teach

783
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,880
um

784
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
so how can security engineers if there

785
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,320
is a deaf sex

786
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,400
ops program or something that's being

787
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,799
developed how can security engineers

788
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,679
work with developers uh product owners

789
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,360
you know vendors how how can third

790
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,760
parties contractors consultants how can

791
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,600
they work with other groups to help them

792
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,480
understand how to integrate security

793
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
um and i think by understanding what

794
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,799
their typical behavior is what a typical

795
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,720
day looks like for a developer i think

796
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,360
could certainly help have

797
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
that empathy and understanding figuring

798
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,200
out what they're doing every day so that

799
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
way they can come in and say you know

800
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,880
what i think this might be better for

801
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
you i think if we try this this might be

802
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,159
helpful

803
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,440
you know so that way you're coming in

804
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
from the perspective of

805
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,760
hey i'm i'm watching you do it what you

806
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,440
do every day i'm seeing you code every

807
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,640
day i'm seeing the projects you're

808
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
working on the teams that you integrate

809
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,640
with or you know sort of what your

810
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,440
timelines are even and now i can come in

811
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,679
and provide you know recommendations for

812
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,880
you and your specific team um instead of

813
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,720
just hey you have these vulnerabilities

814
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,960
fix them you know so it's expanding that

815
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
conversation by using behavioral

816
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
analysis

817
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,200
uh so

818
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,320
what can

819
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,840
i do about it what can you do about it

820
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,159
um i think the biggest thing

821
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,520
is

822
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,840
understanding that there are

823
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,799
other

824
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,919
tools and techniques outside of the

825
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,520
you know technical things that we have

826
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
you know this besides

827
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,760
nmap or fireeye or any virus or whatever

828
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,440
it is that you have in your environment

829
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,559
there are other things that we can do to

830
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,120
improve security within our programs and

831
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
across different teams you know it's not

832
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,279
just a conversation that has to be had

833
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,760
for a blue team or for a soccer for you

834
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,279
know network engineers or anything like

835
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,200
that that it can be a custom

836
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,919
conversation and that if we understand

837
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,640
the behaviors of our users our teams

838
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,600
ourselves that maybe we can help improve

839
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,360
the security of our program through

840
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
those methods too

841
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,200
it was one of the reasons why

842
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,640
i wanted to do the human factors

843
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,799
research and understand how we use

844
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,520
terminology because i think the way we

845
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,279
use terminology the way we talk to each

846
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,399
other uh sometimes can impact the way

847
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,919
that you know security is actually

848
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,200
implemented uh or you know sort of works

849
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,559
in our environment

850
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,000
um

851
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,880
i

852
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,080
certainly

853
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,720
request that people look at research

854
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,399
there is so much research available

855
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,960
academic or otherwise uh on behavioral

856
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,440
analysis and i think if we

857
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,960
continue to do this there's certainly

858
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,480
some gaps in the research especially

859
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,799
when it comes to to cyber security that

860
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,960
you know i know i would love to work on

861
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,360
uh but i think if we can just sort of

862
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,200
know that this exists

863
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,120
do a little bit of research on it and

864
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
start to understand maybe your own

865
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,360
behaviors first so what are my behaviors

866
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,399
how do i

867
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,399
you know what am i doing to impact

868
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,799
security in my environment um and then

869
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,240
sort of expand that conversation to

870
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,919
other people

871
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,880
and even uh

872
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,399
i think that the other biggest thing

873
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,640
that i wanted to to mention too is that

874
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,120
this is not a negative conversation this

875
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,520
is not a well you did this and you did

876
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,880
that like the finger pointing thing that

877
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,159
doesn't work

878
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,399
what does work is

879
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,880
talking with people and having empathy

880
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,720
for them and understanding what their

881
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,440
challenges are and i think ultimately at

882
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,880
the root of

883
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,559
what's going on with cybersecurity and a

884
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,919
lot of the things that we have going on

885
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,720
that we just can't seem to fix um i

886
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
think if we can bring it back to the

887
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,399
fact that we're all humans and we all

888
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,080
make mistakes and we all have our own

889
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,840
patterns of behavior and if we can

890
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,679
understand them and improve them that

891
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,440
that will ultimately help improve the

892
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,720
security of our programs

893
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,000
so

894
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,640
research research research research i

895
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
probably say that like 15 more times

896
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,840
um

897
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,520
this is something that i think a lot of

898
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,360
cyber programs probably don't have the

899
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,600
budgets for because a lot of security

900
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,960
programs are still small i know they're

901
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,120
getting a lot bigger these days but

902
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,559
um

903
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,480
a human factors engineer

904
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,039
a cognitive psychologist why not

905
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,559
consider hiring one of those on your

906
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,600
security team um i know a couple of

907
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,720
great researchers out there want to

908
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,799
mention dr margaret cunningham

909
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,039
she does she's she was a cognitive

910
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,559
psychologist and now she's in the

911
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,159
security world and she blends a lot of

912
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,159
the research together

913
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,799
it's super helpful like the the blending

914
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,240
sort of some of these things together

915
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,919
can be very helpful and help you know

916
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,840
your team uh improve what they're doing

917
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,679
already um

918
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,200
consider training teams on behavioral

919
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,120
analysis techniques why not have a

920
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,600
psychologist come in and do a seminar uh

921
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,799
do a training you know why not

922
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,159
it can't hurt anything it might be

923
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,360
helpful so

924
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,159
um

925
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,440
and then understanding the different

926
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,080
types i think of behavioral analysis and

927
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,519
how they might be applicable to your

928
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,000
cyber program specifically um could be

929
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,320
really helpful

930
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,279
um

931
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,960
peer pressure

932
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,799
i this is something i i haven't

933
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,080
mentioned in the the presentation yet

934
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,440
but i think it's an important

935
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,760
conversation if we think about the

936
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,559
external factors right so not just

937
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,480
um you know what am i doing as a cyber

938
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,000
practitioner within my own group and in

939
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,440
my own you know sort of bubble but

940
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,000
how do i feel do i feel peer pressure do

941
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,039
i feel pressure from the industry to

942
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,559
have certain certifications to have

943
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,320
certain training to have to do this this

944
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,519
this and that

945
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,440
uh whatever it might be

946
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,840
you know um versus

947
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,159
thinking about how our behaviors and how

948
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,080
we actually interact with each other

949
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,960
might be just as impactful um instead of

950
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,720
feeling maybe like this pressure to do

951
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,960
something in a certain way but sort of

952
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,360
evaluating introspection self-reflection

953
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,519
like seeing how those things might

954
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,240
benefit us or benefit our programs as

955
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
well

956
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,039
um

957
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,840
so with that that sort of ends my my

958
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,039
presentation uh again huge thank you to

959
