00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,039
take it away paul

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,800
all right first off uh thank you grimm

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,199
for allowing us this time to uh

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,000
participate in your first time speakers

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,840
uh to track two has definitely been an

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,080
awesome experience following grim for a

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,760
very long time

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,360
and today i'm going to talk about

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,960
kind of a segue into what uh

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
doc said uh you know with the broken

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,480
system the hybrid the vuca

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,879
uh distilling information

16
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,840
and

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,680
you know it definitely wasn't planned it

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,320
just so happens that you know

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,680
some people are just like-minded like

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,039
that

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,800
so a little bit about whole cyber human

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,800
initiative

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,640
we like to joke and between the advisory

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
board and the board of advisors our

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,840
advisory board and the board of

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
directors we like to joke that it's

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
about kind of like a justice league or

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
an avengers right because we're calling

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,439
it an initiative

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,240
uh and just like the avengers

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
they're a reactive force

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
and how we're reacting is the broken

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,159
hiring system

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,159
uh when you look at some of these job

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,159
descriptions and you follow uh people

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,159
like naomi buckwalter when she puts

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,119
these

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,040
unicorn job descriptions out for entry

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
level when you see cissp or a masters

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,520
you know what's next a phd

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
uh so we're fueled by the community so

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,280
everything that we do

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,479
you know we've done

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
copious amounts of research

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,159
grooming

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,920
linkedin you know scrubbing to find

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,280
posts

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,840
and

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,600
understanding where this talent gap is

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
that hr

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
and hiring managers say exist

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
and it doesn't

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,799
you know on average

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,840
between

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
what

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
20 non-elitist type discord groups

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,639
you're looking at

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,720
tens of thousands of talent that's just

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,120
right for picking

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,879
and that's what we do we pull talent and

61
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,519
resources

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,920
from a lot of the influencers out there

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,760
you know a lot of them are actually

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,200
when i approached the idea about the

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
whole cyber human concept

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
i really pulled in people like gerald

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
auger james azar

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,560
stefan simeroth

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
our partner uh boost the books peter

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
klein

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
and

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
we just started to grow with it

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
uh yeah at first it was just gonna be

74
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,480
more of you know we're gonna host a

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,440
monthly

76
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,680
high engagement for mentorship and

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,879
tutelage

78
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,720
and it turned into you know just one day

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,840
after

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
seeing several people that

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,720
you know i mentor

82
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,120
on their last rope ready to cash out and

83
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,720
not apply for

84
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,519
you know any more

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,159
jobs in cyber uh and it's kind of

86
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,599
disheartening because you know that

87
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,200
perseverance

88
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
is kind of the thing that

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
that really drives home

90
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,040
in cyber security you know it's

91
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
continuous learning environment you have

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,879
to be a dedicated lifelong learner

93
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,840
so using the you know the resources

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,120
uh

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,879
specifically free free to inexpensive

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,560
and it's kind of

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,640
kind of how we build it we don't want to

98
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,319
charge candidates

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
you know we have a candidate program

100
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
and you know we really want to drive

101
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
home how to fill

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
these cyber security job gaps

103
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,480
and some of the things that we

104
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,519
we've been doing is to to help bring

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,400
awareness to what cyber security really

106
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,200
is

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,080
and

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,480
there's many different representations

109
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,000
of um

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,720
what someone thinks cyber security is

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,640
and often

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,439
they think the pen tester they think the

113
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,000
sock analyst but those aren't the only

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
roles in cyber there's many other roles

115
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
in cyber um not everyone's a hacker not

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,880
everyone is a coder

117
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
it helps to have those skills but it is

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,639
not a requirement for all the roles

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
and that's one of the things that

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,840
we help

121
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,080
candidates as part of the first step

122
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,199
is to do

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
the self-discovery to figure out which

124
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,280
of the many roles within cyber

125
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,919
really aligns to them

126
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,560
and then how can we uh

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,880
help guide their learning their

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
education to

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
meet what the market is looking for but

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,639
also do it their way to highlight their

131
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,240
strengths to

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
highlight what they're passionate about

133
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,680
so that they

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,320
take their full self into the role and

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
you're not just trying to fit some

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
cookie cutter definition of what they

137
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
think cyber security is

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
exactly right and then you know we can

139
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
pay homage to our veterans right so

140
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,479
when you look at a 10 to 20 year veteran

141
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,360
uh or a mill spouse or a dependent

142
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,120
they have so many hard and soft skills

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,160
that are encoded into their etho

144
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
that you know

145
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,120
they're shooting for these entry-level

146
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,199
roles and getting shot down because

147
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,240
they're getting told they're over

148
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,759
experienced

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,960
and then they're trying to apply for

150
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,039
these senior technical roles

151
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,240
and they're getting shot down because

152
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,560
they don't have experience

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,360
so

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,120
when we meet with a candidate especially

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,720
you know a veteran or a career pivoter

156
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,639
we kind of hone in on

157
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,880
what skills they already have

158
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,400
right so if we're talking about sewing

159
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,360
and food management maybe they have 14

160
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
years and they're you know a regional

161
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,520
manager

162
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
why

163
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,479
why are you as a regional manager trying

164
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
to apply for

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,960
these type of roles that

166
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
that won't suit you currently right if

167
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,080
that's your end game you want to be a

168
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,759
practitioner

169
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,440
look at the mid to senior level roles

170
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,479
for now

171
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
to get your footing you know become a

172
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
project manager

173
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,080
uh a sock manager

174
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,360
you have different types of rules where

175
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,880
you don't have to be a hundred percent

176
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
technical you just have to know the

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,919
business

178
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,000
and know what each one of your teammates

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,880
can accomplish on a day-to-day basis

180
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,280
and you know really breaking down

181
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,520
uh the color wheel to them and you got

182
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,280
the infosec color wheel you got the

183
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
cyber security color wheel

184
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,680
and then you got a more robust one with

185
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
critical infrastructure

186
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,280
so when we talk to our candidates and we

187
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,400
we've

188
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
really uh what we focus on is this is a

189
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,639
nice framework

190
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,240
and we send them over there they look at

191
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
the 52 rolls

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,759
the 33 sub specialties

193
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,000
and they really break it down and look

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
at the rule uh the roles

195
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,919
responsibilities of duties and the

196
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,360
skills

197
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
that are required for those roles

198
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,280
and it just so happens when they do that

199
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
we can help align them

200
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
with their certain color wheel

201
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,400
which is actually something that we've

202
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,759
been working on with a badging system

203
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,199
for our candidates

204
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,440
so when we present a badge

205
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,000
it's going to have a nice color based on

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,680
you know what color will their effluent

207
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
you know and the first thing we like to

208
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,840
do is talk about the front end go ahead

209
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,240
chris i was gonna say uh well uh while

210
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
we're finishing off the color wheel i

211
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,440
think the color wheel helps to show the

212
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
different groupings of rolls so they're

213
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
not overloaded with the 52 but um also

214
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,840
to show that everything is not just um

215
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
the red team not just the sock but the

216
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
different areas that they can

217
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,080
potentially look into

218
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,039
um

219
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,639
pivoting over to the front end system

220
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,599
one of the biggest detractors for many

221
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,840
applicants is the applicant tracking

222
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,800
system

223
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
and

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
it was initially created to help scale

225
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,080
applicants when a lot of people were

226
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
applying the problem is

227
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
it is broken in

228
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,319
it

229
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,440
filters out too many of the qualified

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,479
applicants simply because the user or

231
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,840
the system

232
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,120
um

233
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,400
doesn't click on a keyword that someone

234
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,280
had in their resume or that the employer

235
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,159
was looking for so it then

236
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,559
uh

237
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,559
de-prioritizes them on who gets picked

238
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,399
uh for those roles the other problem

239
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,360
also comes on the candidate side where

240
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,680
you're not tailoring their resume

241
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
specifically for those roles so that

242
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,399
they won't get pinged when um recruiters

243
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
or hiring managers are searching through

244
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
the applicant tracking system

245
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
which is why i'm a big promoter of human

246
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
to human engagement it kind of bypasses

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,920
the applicant tracking system you get to

248
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,839
know the hiring managers you get to know

249
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,160
your peers ahead of time

250
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,120
and

251
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,959
meet and talk to them

252
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
and that's how you potentially could get

253
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,160
into a role i know it

254
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,480
involves a lot more time networking with

255
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
individuals but

256
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,440
it

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
provides you with that quality

258
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,200
connection to a hiring manager to appear

259
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,320
and that connection could get your

260
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
resume or your application

261
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,320
uh to the hiring manager um

262
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,120
and their their qualified list sooner

263
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,720
yeah you know that you know networking

264
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,600
is

265
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,839
hands down look at look across linkedin

266
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,240
look across twitter and facebook

267
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,959
networking is one of the single most

268
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,760
impactful things that give people jobs

269
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,959
now you can bypass the ats all together

270
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,480
you know when you make that lasting

271
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
connection that meaningful connection

272
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,120
you know not not saying go out and

273
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
you know

274
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,320
personal invite and say hey you know uh

275
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,839
you work for this company it's cool i

276
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
want to get to know you and then your

277
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
second message is hey i've seen this job

278
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
description and i'd love to talk to you

279
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,680
about it no build that rapport get to

280
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
know them right

281
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,720
because once they know you

282
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
they can kind of

283
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,240
let the panelists know

284
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,000
you know when you interview your your

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
style right because the interview

286
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
process is

287
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,120
very very mistreated

288
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,279
uh you know you figure the ats is your

289
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,959
first interview

290
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
and a lot of candidates that apply for

291
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
jobs

292
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
they have a spray and pray resume right

293
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
they list everything right

294
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,040
uh and they just keep adding and adding

295
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,720
and adding that way they can bypass that

296
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
ats

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
but then it's not tailored when it gets

298
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
to that hiring manager or that technical

299
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,120
lead that's gonna interview you

300
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
you know and most of the time

301
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,800
when you get to the panelist side when

302
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,399
you sit down with the five to six folks

303
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,279
that are going to interview you

304
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,959
this is the first time they've seen your

305
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,959
resume

306
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,480
so you know if there's things that

307
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
don't line up for that job and they're

308
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,079
already looking at it and that's their

309
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,480
first impression on you as a team

310
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,440
right

311
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,760
uh speaking of resumes you know we just

312
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,680
got done talking to a gentleman

313
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,279
that had

314
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,440
you know it was a nice resume it has

315
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,920
definitely put put a lot of time into it

316
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,600
but

317
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,920
it had sitting for sec plus in 2019

318
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,680
so the attention to find detail on your

319
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,959
resume

320
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,800
you know cyber security is about fine

321
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
detail

322
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,680
so if you're putting stuff that you've

323
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,279
already accomplished

324
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
take it out

325
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,880
uh you know because right now you're

326
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,360
looking at you know in anywhere between

327
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,880
three to six interviews and that could

328
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,639
take up to two months

329
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,959
and this is why it's critical to network

330
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
you get that internal referral and

331
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,279
you're bypassing a lot of the internal

332
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
stuff like talking to a recruiter

333
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
talking to a techno recruiter

334
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
talking to the hiring manager you know

335
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
tech lead and so on

336
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,399
but some people just can't network

337
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,160
you know when we talk about different

338
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,560
types of personalities

339
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
some people just don't have that skill

340
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,839
and that's kind of

341
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,839
what we do as a community you know if

342
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,040
you look at

343
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,600
cyber security community in general

344
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,920
we're very upfront

345
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
we're very giving

346
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,480
and it really relies on the applicants

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,079
and the candidates

348
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,399
to do the work do being the key word

349
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,079
and we talk about that here in a little

350
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,440
bit too

351
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,959
but candidates don't do it they don't

352
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,120
use the network like it's supposed to

353
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,959
and as you mentioned that mean

354
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,800
meaningful connection once you have that

355
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
meaningful connection with someone you

356
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
can

357
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,120
then

358
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,399
um

359
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,000
unders they can understand what you're

360
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,720
looking for and even if that company the

361
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,040
fit with that company is not good they

362
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
could recommend you to someone else and

363
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,720
that's that's the brilliance of

364
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
networking

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,880
um

366
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,160
so let's move on to our next

367
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,800
yeah system broken api

368
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,519
now go ahead

369
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,680
paul you want to take this away um i

370
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,480
love your your story about the

371
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,399
uh dod

372
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,480
requirements and

373
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,560
how that got misused and using as a

374
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,279
or abused as a filter

375
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,440
absolutely so

376
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,680
we call the the broken api right you

377
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
know we

378
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
as managers as leaders we're holding too

379
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
much value in certifications

380
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,959
to the point that has become an entry

381
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,880
level requirement

382
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,440
you know when we talk about when

383
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,839
a lot of us old farts got

384
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,440
you know novel search and stuff like

385
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
that those are bragging rights

386
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,560
you know

387
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
it used to be you know i'm a

388
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
professional and now i'm an expert

389
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
because i just got to surf

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,360
uh

391
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,480
but

392
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
you know and i think

393
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,519
when we look

394
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,120
2010

395
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,959
to now

396
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,880
i think it was built off a broken dod

397
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,760
model you know the 8140 8570 was created

398
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,600
over a decade ago

399
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,279
and that's the dod cybersecurity

400
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,120
workforce model

401
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
and it's a broken model

402
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,880
uh you know why would you

403
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
why would you bring a broken model into

404
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,240
the industry

405
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,560
and my paul cummings opinion is too many

406
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,320
company executives are born from dod

407
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,680
cloth

408
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
uh you know when we think about veterans

409
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,839
service members

410
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,720
uh

411
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,920
government employees and dod contractors

412
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
they've all been institutionalized in

413
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
the mindset that

414
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
you know this is on paper what i have to

415
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,399
get

416
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
in order to do my job

417
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,880
you know when we look at somebody

418
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,680
you know as far as like a navy i.t

419
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,560
uh

420
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
you know an avit you go to a ship for

421
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,839
your first uh first ship and you're

422
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,000
you're there for five years and let's

423
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,920
say you don't get the luxury of being in

424
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
adp or the information assurance office

425
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
and you get stuck doing you know

426
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,079
communications technician

427
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,000
well you've done that for five years now

428
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,360
and you're ready for your short duty

429
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,279
you're ready to go do something

430
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,839
that has meaning

431
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,279
you know because you know a lot of comm

432
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,680
stations they just don't have the luxury

433
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,360
of computer

434
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,519
help desks and you know administration

435
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,199
stuff like that

436
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,560
but

437
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,680
you know now you've got this person

438
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,600
that's been in for five years

439
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,279
and

440
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,199
they're told they can't select for

441
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,199
certain roles because they don't have

442
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,839
security plus

443
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,920
and they can't get security plus because

444
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,160
when you look at the dod they want you

445
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
to have x amount of time

446
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,680
in order to submit for that

447
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,800
certification to get paid for

448
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,040
and that leads to a lot of broken boot

449
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,079
camps

450
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,480
boot camps that are costing 25 to 3 000

451
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,160
dollars

452
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,440
or twenty five hundred three thousand

453
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,399
dollars

454
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,160
and yeah they're four or five days long

455
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,399
and they're just teaching a test

456
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,040
um you know personally i i despise boot

457
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
camps i went to one

458
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,320
uh

459
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,279
shortly before i retired from the navy

460
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,440
and the instructor said straight off

461
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,279
straight out the gate i'm only required

462
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,800
to legally teach you two hours of book

463
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,600
and then passed everybody in class

464
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
an exam cram

465
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,959
you know and

466
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,759
hey

467
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,079
here you go keep taking this

468
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,839
you know this test over and over again

469
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,720
so you can practice taking the test

470
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
so that's that's my roundabout example

471
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,600
of you know how

472
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
how we've adopted a broken system

473
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
you know when you look at security plus

474
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,880
it says two years minimum as a require

475
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,480
recommendation but

476
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,920
you look at boot camps they don't follow

477
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
that

478
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
and and that model has pivoted over to

479
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,720
the private sector as well and when you

480
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,400
look at many of the

481
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,000
entry-level requirements for

482
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,079
cyber security roles they're they're

483
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,760
asking for three to five years

484
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,039
experience and while many can say that

485
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,359
there's true that there isn't an

486
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,720
entry-level role in cyber that's

487
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,199
what breaks the system because there are

488
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,559
ways to

489
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,360
skill up with on-the-job training with

490
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,959
apprenticeships with

491
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,840
models like that where you can bring

492
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
someone in

493
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,640
teach them give them a subset of the

494
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,520
tasks and as they grow an experience

495
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,400
give them more tasks but if everyone's

496
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
asking for three to five years of

497
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,120
experience you'll never find

498
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,360
you you'll constantly say that you don't

499
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,520
have that the talent that you're looking

500
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
for because you're setting unrealistic

501
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,760
expectations for what someone needs to

502
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,559
do

503
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,600
and

504
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,720
while a small company could say well we

505
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,120
need someone to be able to hit the

506
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
ground running which is a term to

507
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,840
absolutely hate

508
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
um they're setting up

509
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,559
false expectations for what they

510
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,520
consider an entry-level role because

511
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
when when they get to that role most of

512
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,120
the times

513
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,360
they're not doing things that an

514
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
entry-level person are doing you're

515
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
doing mid to senior level roles and

516
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
that's truly where we have the biggest

517
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,160
gap is mid to senior level roles and

518
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,840
leadership roles and we're looking to

519
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,520
help re-modify change the expectations

520
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,640
and create a pipeline and a growth model

521
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,200
to work with companies to develop talent

522
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,640
from xero and move them up

523
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
and i wouldn't even say zero really you

524
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,320
know you got a lot of people out there

525
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,840
that

526
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
that are curious you know they get on

527
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,679
the youtubes they watch

528

how to hack xyz or how to use wireshark

529
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,480
you know for their home environment

530
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,880
stuff like that and then you got kids in

531
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,400
stem school

532
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,240
you know some of these kids in stem

533
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
school you know we have one candidate at

534
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
16 years old

535
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
that blew me away

536
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,480
you know we did our intake

537
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
zoom last night

538
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,960
not only did he skip a grade

539
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,679
but

540
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,360
you know he's already got collegiate

541
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,200
level

542
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,120
uh education under his belt for

543
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
computers right

544
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,080
and

545
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,000
his guidance counselor is trying to lead

546
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,200
him towards a plus to get a plus right

547
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,559
off the bat

548
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,080
when

549
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
why why why do i have to have this piece

550
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,880
of paper to justify that i know what a

551
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
computer is and the software and

552
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
services that run on it

553
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,919
you know why are you already gating me

554
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,280
for

555
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
you know a help best technician type

556
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,000
role

557
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
um

558
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,799
you know and degrees is another thing

559
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,240
that's you know highly mistreated you

560
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
know when there's no

561
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,679
when you look at say associates where

562
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,080
it's a two-year degree

563
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,520
you probably spent

564
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,400
five courses

565
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
roughly you know fifteen

566
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars

567
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,559
on uh coursework before you even touch

568
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,360
your first elective

569
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,600
when you know a high schooler can go out

570
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,200
and get a certification based on the

571
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,440
role that they want to do

572
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,120
and have that true return on investment

573
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
not only for the company but for that

574
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,240
person

575
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,400
if you look at a degree and you're

576
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,919
you're talking about a fifteen thousand

577
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,559
dollar associates

578
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,320
and you're applying and the first job

579
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,480
you get is forty five thousand dollars

580
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,600
sixty thousand dollars a year

581
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,039
you know you gotta take in consideration

582
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,240
that you've already spent fifteen

583
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,039
thousand to get to that so really you're

584
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,679
still paying that debt

585
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
not to mention

586
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,320
for many entry-level roles

587
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,600
having a bachelor's as a filter

588
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,280
is

589
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,120
it hurts the underrepresented it hurts

590
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,960
individuals that

591
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,480
might not be fit for college where

592
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,400
paul and i look at

593
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,760
cyber security as a trade versus

594
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,840
something that's technical you don't

595
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,760
need to have a

596
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,159
degree to be successful in in cyber

597
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,360
security and most of the successful

598
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,799
individuals

599
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,200
in cyber security they came from a

600
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,679
variety of different backgrounds music

601
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,960
history liberal arts and they didn't

602
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,480
need to have a degree to be successful

603
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
but it's also you know

604
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,240
let's face the facts you know it's not

605
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
just the hr it's not just to hire

606
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,960
managers not just job descriptions

607
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
it's also

608
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,080
the applicants and the candidates you

609
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,600
know when they get mentorship they're

610
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
expecting

611
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
here's a handout go do this you're gonna

612
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,320
get a job and it goes back to

613
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,440
you know they're shooting themselves in

614
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
the foot because they don't want to do

615
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,559
the work

616
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,360
uh and that's partly a lot of it

617
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,840
and then we talk about the back ends

618
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,640
you know sadly biases still

619
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
still exist today

620
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,679
uh

621
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,440
but you know for the sake of calling the

622
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,600
kettle black talent is talent no matter

623
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,400
the age race sex sexual preference

624
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,600
religion gender identification

625
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,280
our threat actors don't care about that

626
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,799
why are we

627
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,559
right

628
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,080
you know we don't give credit to our

629
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,919
veterans and military spouses that have

630
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,159
hard and critical soft skills

631
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,400
you know often and sally too often a

632
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,640
veteran who has 20 years in the service

633
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
who is not an iot or cyber security

634
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,159
specialist

635
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,840
are always told

636
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,720
go entry level start entry level

637
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,840
why

638
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,679
you know when 28 to 30 percent of roles

639
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,120
that are unfilled are mid to senior

640
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
level roles

641
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
where they already have copious amounts

642
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,559
of leadership

643
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
absolutely and and the other thing when

644
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,600
it comes to

645
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,919
neurodiversity uh gender biases cultural

646
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,360
biases

647
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
they

648
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,080
filter out um

649
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,480
[Music]

650
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,080
subconsciously

651
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,840
a large variety of the the talent that's

652
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,559
out there because they don't look

653
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,000
sound

654
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,919
come from a similar background as them

655
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,559
but the problem is if everyone's coming

656
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,799
from that same background having that

657
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
same train of thought

658
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,320
we won't have the diverse the diversity

659
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,080
and thought to be able to solve the

660
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,960
complex problems that

661
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,919
threat actors are creating uh threat

662
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,200
actors they they're gangs they come from

663
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,440
all sorts of environments they they

664
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
don't screen based on those things if

665
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
you could do the job they'll take you

666
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,760
like they don't care so why should why

667
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,919
should we have

668
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:00,960
those

669
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
implementations or those filters um as

670
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,080
well

671
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,600
absolutely yeah and then how how we help

672
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
each other you know how can we help each

673
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,679
other as a community we need to develop

674
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,440
lifelong learners

675
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,880
right you know when you talk to some

676
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
candidates they they think that they're

677
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,840
going to do this they're going to get

678
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,120
the job and that's the only thing

679
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,880
they're going to do

680
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
so we have to develop that

681
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,720
you know we have to as a community

682
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,039
partner with employers

683
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,279
help them find that diverse talent

684
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,440
you know diversity can bring a lot to a

685
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,600
table when you have different mindsets

686
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,640
and different culture type thinking

687
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
and at the end of the day strengthen the

688
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,840
community

689
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,039
as well as open their eyes to how

690
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,520
that diverse where that diverse talent

691
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,480
can come from and show them that the

692
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,960
benefits of having that diversity

693
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,799
so that's where we come to the whole

694
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,200
cyber human

695
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,880
yeah the whole cyber this whole cyber

696
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,919
human approach uh the way we do it you

697
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,799
know to really secret sauce is

698
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,600
you know

699
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,360
the soul-searching

700
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,039
identifying you know you got those

701
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,400
people i want to do a soccer analyst or

702
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,480
i want to do pen test boom

703
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
those are two sexy terms they want to be

704
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
in those roles

705
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,000
they don't understand the 52

706
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,159
you know roles and 33 sub-specialties

707
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,520
that they can

708
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
absolutely do right now

709
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,840
and use the other job as their dream job

710
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,679
and build that two-year year and seven

711
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,880
year plan

712
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,840
you know what is your actual endgame

713
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,760
you know part two

714
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,919
uh so we broke our worksheet our

715
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,600
candidate worksheet up into two parts

716
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,880
yeah the first one is we want to get to

717
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,159
know somebody

718
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,240
candidate emails you know request uh

719
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,520
information

720
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,440
you know and we get them over

721
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,799
the worksheet

722
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,720
uh part two of the worksheet though you

723
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,919
know after

724
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,679
after they've shown that they have

725
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,720
actually

726
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,039
dive deep into the roles they understand

727
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,760
them and we verify it through you know

728
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,200
our intake

729
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,000
they get part two which is rigorous

730
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
uh and it's rigorous for a reason you

731
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,279
know because cyber security is supposed

732
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,720
to be challenging

733
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,600
you have to welcome the uncertainty as

734
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
you know daily buck walter would say

735
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,480
and you know everything we use is free

736
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,840
education

737
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
uh we don't get our candidates to spend

738
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,840
any money on anything we just give them

739
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,279
taste of things

740
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,400
things like

741
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,120
the immersive labs beta

742

rangeforce community edition so you can

745
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,679
a little you know learn a little bit

746
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,960
about blue team

747
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,640
uh this is

748
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,880
you know ics vlp

749
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,080
you know when we talk about their

750
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,200
virtual any

751
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,960
virtual learning pipeline

752
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
there's a lot of it that translates over

753
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,600
in traditional iot and cyber already

754
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
you're just now learning about this new

755
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,039
threat that has come to light with

756
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,360
colonial pipeline and several other

757
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,679
breaches to critical infrastructure

758
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,679
so now it gives you that ability to to

759
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,120
really have that

760

um

762
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,919
and these are just some of the you know

763
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,760
trainings that they do and they have to

764
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,080

this is the speci you're leaving with

788
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,480
this is the specific type of role that

789
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,840
i'm looking for

790
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,919
and then we're working to partner them

791
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,720
up with companies that are looking to

792
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,919

793
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,279
make the match come together

794
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,120
yeah we use that with swot

795
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,640
you know it's

796
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
if you can understand swot and use that

797
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,880
in your daily grind for applying for

798
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,520
jobs you're not going to fail

799
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,720
it's a tried and true model

800
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,880
and i'm glad that chris was able to get

801
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,520
it uploaded to the uh our

802
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,840
presentation

803
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,679
yeah one of the things that um

804
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,720
with the swat with networking it's

805
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,440
really just finding ways to provide

806
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,399
value and to show the employer the value

807
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,840
that you can deliver to them so

808
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,320
take take your background show the value

809
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,039
that you've provided there and then

810
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,640
translate that to how you're going to

811
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,200
provide value to the company and

812
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,520
networking is the key

813
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,840
um not just networking with computers

814
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,159
but networking with actual people

815
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,720
and that's the whole human

816
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,480
initiative aspect because we want to

817
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,279
make it human again versus just being

818
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,360
another number in the applicant tracking

819
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,200
system

820
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,360
right and that's kind of how you know we

821
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,039
designed the training right we chose

822
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,200
training based off of it's going to give

823
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,440
you a fill for each color of the color

824
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,640
wheel

825
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,240
you know the critical thinking that's

826
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,840
required in your

827
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,720
a lot of different roles orange red blue

828
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,039
and it's like

829
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,480
you know it's just one of those things

830
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,960
that baffles me that when somebody that

831
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,520
just approaches sock analyst that's all

832
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,960
they know they don't they can't tell you

833
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,480
anything about

834
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
what other roles do

835
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,480
uh

836
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,399
and that leaves us you know as we get

837
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,840
close to the end you know

838
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,880
yeah this is for helping this is the

839
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,679
whole human initiative plus you as in a

840
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,399
company so we want to help the company

841
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,200
by

842
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,640
helping them review their job

843
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,159
descriptions show where they are

844
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,640
limiting themselves in the talent pool

845
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,360
help

846
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,640
deliver them pre-qualified pre-assessed

847
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,240
talent as well as making recommendations

848
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,559
on how they can screen the talent how

849
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,360
they can find the best talent and then

850
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,559
help them with prioritizing the talent

851
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,760
that they have

852
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,200
for their interview that way they're

853
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,240
closing in on great talent quickly

854
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
now plenty contributions we are brand

855
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
new so obviously it's a lot of

856
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,120
out-of-pocket expenses however we just

857
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,720
made a partnership with a veteran-owned

858
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,279
company called proper patriot

859
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,120
and they're going to back sell t-shirts

860
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
polos and hoodies for us

861
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,279
now

862
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
when you see them they are going to be

863
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,039
pricey but the reason they're pricey

864
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,279
is the proceeds directly feed a mini

865
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,519
scholarship program that we're starting

866
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,360
where we provide scholarship-based

867
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,960
challenges

868
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
for folks to get certifications that

869
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,480
have really you know true return on the

870
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,919
value for the jobs that they're looking

871
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,679
for

872
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,159
and we need more strategic partnerships

873
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,000

874
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,600
daily we're talking to companies that

875
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,279
want to partner up

876
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,320
and

877
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
