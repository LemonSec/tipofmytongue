hi my name is elaine harrison newkirk

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,279
and i'm really excited to be here as a

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,080
new speaker for grim pound six grim has

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,480
one of my favorite virtual conferences

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,560
i've been watching them since they

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,760
started i'm here to talk about fun with

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,760
miter tech navigator and nist sp

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,480
800-53

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,200
if any of you have experience with nist

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
you likely don't equate it with the word

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,200
fun

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
i'm hoping that some of the tools i'm

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
going to show you will

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,800
if not make this a little more fun at

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,360
least make it more efficient and easier

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,719
to do your risk assessments

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,440
i currently lead the customer support

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
program at an amazing startup company

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,039
known as site

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,760
we've built an adversary emulation

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,560
platform and we also offer purple team

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
consulting

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
prior to working at site i was a blue

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,759
teamer i worked last as a network

28
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,360
security engineer in the healthcare

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,920
sector and before that as a network

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,640
administrator in finance

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,439
i did originally start out as entry

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,400
level pc tech and worked my way up into

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
cyber security after a few years of

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,439
working as a tech

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,240
i

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,040
before that i was a hotel manager but i

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
quickly learned that i preferred

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,360
computers over people

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,720
i volunteer for cyber security nonprofit

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
i'm an education lead there my job with

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,240
csmp is to procure cyber security blogs

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,360
from people i also write them myself and

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,200
then i publish them

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
if anyone's interested in writing a

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,360
cyber security focus blog reach out to

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
me on linkedin or twitter and we can

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,280
talk about it i do need new bloggers for

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,080
2022.

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
i'm a mom of three awesome young women

50
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,080
and a bearded dragon named taco

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,239
as you can see from my picture he's

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
pretty clingy he's my co-worker he

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,400
shares an office with me

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
but he has no problem in invading my

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
personal space

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,360
he is pretty quiet so i'm cool with that

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,879
except for when he decides he's going to

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,040
take a nap on my keyboard or his worms

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,239
get loose on my desk

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,440
today i'm going to talk about how i came

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360
across attack navigator and the nist

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,840
mappings i'm also going to talk about

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,360
miter attack attack navigator and ssp

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
800-53

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,120
and what they are

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,440
and lastly i'll talk a little bit about

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,519
how defenders or the blue teamers can

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,000
use these tools to their advantage

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,879
i'm hoping this won't be another boring

70
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,800
slideshow i'm going to try really hard

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,120
not to read off the slides although i

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,920
probably will read some word for word

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,879
i do have a live demo planned

74
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,959
i did make my

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,080
sacrifice to the demo guys earlier today

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,560
i left them some twinkies on the table

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,879
with a glass of milk

78
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
so hopefully they will see me in their

79
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,920
favor

80
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
and not burn down my demo

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,040
when i started working at scythe back in

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,920
march i was tasked with learning how to

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,040
use the adversary emulation platform

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
because i needed to be able to support

85
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,680
our customers so as i was creating

86
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,720
campaigns and utilizing the features i

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,200
noticed in the reporting there were

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
nist 800-53

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
summaries available to be used with

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
attack navigator in json form

91
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
i didn't really know what a json file

92
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
was i had heard of them but never used

93
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,720
them

94
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
and i had also heard of a tech navigator

95
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
but didn't have a lot of information on

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,879
that

97
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,640
so i got on google and did some research

98
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
and reading

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
and then i tested out the site summaries

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
in attack navigator

101
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
as i was using attack navigator with the

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,358
summaries and customizing them and

103
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,358
trying out all of the features

104
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,880
i had

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
uh really started i had started wishing

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
that i had known about this previously

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
when i worked in healthcare as a network

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,560
security engineer it would have made my

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,680
life a lot easier to have that tool and

110
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
all that information at my fingertips

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
so i thought it was so cool and i

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
thought that i it would be great if i

113
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,479
could share this with other people

114
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,800
who maybe didn't know about it either

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
and i wrote a two-part blog for cyber

116
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,720
security non-profit

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
i also wrote more of a site-centered

118
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,280
blog forsythe for our customers

119
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,400
minor attack is a free and open source

120
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,919
collaboration

121
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,240
red and blue teams globally collect

122
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,880
information and submit it to mitre

123
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,039
this is a knowledge base that contains

124
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,600
adversary groups their tactics and

125
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,960
techniques and software that they're

126
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,000
known to use as well as mitigations that

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
are known to work with those techniques

128
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
the miter attack framework focuses on

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
enterprise mobile device and industrial

130
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,320
control systems or icf

131
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,280
you can see on the mitre attack homepage

132
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,360
there's already a lot of information

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,600
right here on the first page

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,759
you can click on these links and the

135
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,680
different techniques to get more

136
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,759
information about those

137
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,479
there's also headers here at the top so

138
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
you can

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
you know drill down into

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
whatever

141
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,440
information you're looking for

142
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
let's say

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
we want to look at a group a particular

144
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
group that we've been reading about that

145
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
maybe is

146
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,360
is targeting us let's say apt41

147
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
so on the apt41 group page

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
there's a little blurb about the group

149
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,600
it also notes associated groups

150
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,759
when the page was created and when it

151
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,840
was last updated

152
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,240
you have a section here for associated

153
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
groups in their descriptions so this

154
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,199
will take you to the wicked panda page

155
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,759
you have the

156
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,479
techniques that are used by the groups

157
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,639
so you have the domain they might target

158
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,440
the miter attack id number for all

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,360
techniques starts with a t

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,240
these are sub technique numbers

161
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,199
and then the minor attack technique name

162
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,840
and how the group uses it

163
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,400
as you scroll further down

164
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,720
there will be a list of software the

165
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,479
group's known to use

166
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,960
these id numbers start with an s also

167
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,080
the group id numbers start with a g

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
there is reference information and then

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,199
all of the different techniques that is

170
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,680
are used with that software are also

171
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,039
here

172
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,639
then further down at the bottom of the

173
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,440
page are references and links

174
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,039
for more information if you want to

175
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,960
really dig in and

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
learn more about that group

177
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,599
later also

178
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,680
offers free training

179
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,400
this is a great training page

180
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,639
training sorry this is a great training

181
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,520
class it's a hands-on and self-paced

182
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,199
class it does get you using minor so you

183
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
can get more familiar

184
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,120
on how to navigate it and how to use it

185
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
and if you're just starting out learning

186
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,919
about minor i would suggest that you do

187
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,120
check it out

188
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,240
i know that

189
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,319
many infrastruct professionals already

190
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,680
utilize mitre on a weekly or daily basis

191
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
but even for you

192
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,919
if you do use motorola it might not be a

193
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,878
bad refresher

194
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,080
my co-unicorn natalie kano wrote a blog

195
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,639
for the scythe unicorn library

196
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,400
titled simplifying the miter attack

197
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,039
framework in this blog she breaks down

198
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
all of the components that make up the

199
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,199
miter attack framework and explains what

200
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,639
each of them are and how they work

201
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,680
together

202
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,560
she did a fantastic job with this blog

203
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,400
if you're starting out learning about

204
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,160
minor this is a

205
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
resource that you really should check

206
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,800
out and read the link is here to get the

207
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,280
blog from the unicorn library it's free

208
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
for everyone

209
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
we also won't ask for your information

210
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,839
to read the blog you can just read it

211
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,839
in her blog she noted the more moves we

212
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,760
can predict the more chances we have to

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,559
win

214
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,360
natalie's also from the blue team side

215
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,320
and

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,279
as far as her statement goes she's right

217
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,920
the more you know about your adversary

218
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,720
and how they're going to try to attack

219
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,279
and infiltrate you

220
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,839
the better chance you have of creating

221
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,680
your defenses and keeping them out

222
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,360
the blue team can use motor attack to

223
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,480
gather cyber threat intelligence or cti

224
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,160
they can

225
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,720
research groups that are likely to

226
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,279
attack their sector for example when i

227
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,160
worked at healthcare i would go to mitre

228
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
to research groups that were known to

229
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,279
target healthcare with ransomware

230
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
and then the minor attack matrices offer

231
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,080
a well-organized easy

232
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,560
to visualize site

233
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,599
full of information

234
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,839
the tech navigator was created by minor

235
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,320
attack this is a github project it's

236
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,480
available as a website but you can also

237
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,720
download the components and set it up in

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,440
your own lab or in your network if you

239
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,120
wanted to

240
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,360
this is just another option

241
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
given by mitre to manipulate miter

242
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,240
attack matrices

243
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,279
and

244
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,600
and the components within the attack

245
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
navigator to create your layers

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,079
for visualization

247
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,719
it's highly customizable

248
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,920
you're able to create your own layers

249
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,880
there's also layers available online

250
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,360
that were created by other people

251
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,600
this screenshot is of a layer that was

252
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
created by matt graber

253
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,600
to help boot teams with application

254
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,720
security

255
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
it's titled windows application control

256
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
mitigation coverage

257
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,680
this particular layer focuses on

258
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,880
enterprise and minor attack version nine

259
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,839
and it's drilled down to just windows

260
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,200
devices

261
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
the legend shows that the red

262
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,880
techniques have no mitigations tied to

263
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,279
them where the darker green techniques

264
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,680
have the most security controls and

265
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,959
mitigations tied to them

266
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,440
and this is what the actual layer looks

267
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,680
like

268
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,079
and then you would be able to come in

269
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,200
here and

270
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
customize this layer the way you want it

271
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
if you wanted to try it out just try it

272
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,920
out to get used to using an attack

273
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
navigator or it's possible that this is

274
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,000
something you've been looking for and

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,720
can use it for a resource

276
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
this special publication 800-53

277
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,480
security and privacy controls for

278
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
information systems and organizations

279
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,320
that's a mouthful if you can say all of

280
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
that without stumbling or reading it off

281
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,959
the screen like i'm doing i will buy you

282
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,320
lunch

283
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,560
this document was created as a guide for

284
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
federal and critical infrastructure

285
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,519
infrastructure information systems

286
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
originally it was just meant to be used

287
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,920
on the federal level

288
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
as time went by

289
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,560
and

290
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,120
more information security people

291
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
became aware of it they started using it

292
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
in different sectors

293
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,000
for risk assessments and to just to

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
ensure that they had defensive depth

295
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,880
each

296
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,440
family or category of security controls

297
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
contains multiple controls within it

298
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,040
and it's a really

299
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,079
long

300
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,120
large document

301
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,800
if you go to the nest page revision 5 is

302
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,240
the most recent version of this

303
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,880
the nest page itself has a lot of

304
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,760
at excuse me a lot of information

305
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,160
there's also templates and spreadsheets

306
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,440
and other resources available here

307
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,040
if you don't know a lot about this or

308
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
you're just learning this is another

309
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,320
great resource

310
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,279
you're able to download the pdf file or

311
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,000
you can just read it online

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,720
it is nearly 500 pages of dry readings

313
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,399
if you've never been to the desert

314
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,880
without water read this document and

315
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,079
you'll understand how that feels

316
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,279
it is very dry and detailed but there's

317
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,839
so much useful information in this

318
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,160
everybody should at least

319
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
check it out

320
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
the center for threatened form defense

321
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
released a set of mappings between minor

322
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,399
attack and nist in december of 2020.

323
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
the goal of this project

324
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
was to

325
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
enable the blue teamers to

326
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,079
have a tool that would make it easier to

327
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,399
map the threats and techniques to the

328
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,440
nest controls and

329
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,600
make it more efficient for them to do

330
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,680
their risk assessments and close their

331
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,360
security gaps

332
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,600
this was quite an undertaking and i'm

333
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
sure it took some time to go through all

334
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
of the tech miter attack techniques and

335
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,839
map those to the security controls it's

336
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760
definitely not something i would want to

337
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,959
undertake

338
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
but i think it's a fantastic project and

339
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,120
i'm really happy that the center for

340
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,839
threatened form defense decided to do it

341
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,040
the attack control framework mappings is

342
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
the center for threatened form defense's

343
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
github page

344
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,000
and

345
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,639
this page contains the

346
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,920
all of the mappings from mitre 2 nest

347
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,519
the readme file has multiple folders and

348
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,040
files within it

349
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,680
and there's a lot of information so

350
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,079
my first suggestion is to read through

351
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,079
everything which will help give you a

352
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,839
better understanding of how it's going

353
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,160
to work

354
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
this is what the github page looks like

355
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
as you can see there's multiple folders

356
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,199
here

357
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,040
this is the frameworks folder which is

358
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,920
where all the layers are housed

359
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
and then down here there's different

360
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
repository contents pages

361
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,760
we're going to focus on the use cases

362
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,000
there's several use cases here that can

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,519
be used by blue teamers it's possible

364
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,120
that the blue team already has a

365
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,279
scenario similar to this or they're

366
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
trying to just

367
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
come up with scenarios and need a little

368
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
bit of a push

369
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,760
we're going to focus on scenario number

370
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,800
four we are going to look to determine

371
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,760
what security controls can be used to

372
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,959
mitigate techniques used by a specific

373
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,279
group

374
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
there's also an option in the readme to

375
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,560
download a spreadsheet

376
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,440
of the nest tomato mappings in an excel

377
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
format

378
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,480
this spreadsheet's another great

379
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
resource

380
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,519
it has all of the security controls and

381
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,720
which are mapped to which techniques

382
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,959
it is a lot of information but i think

383
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,600
it's really great for a quick reference

384
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,240
you'll see there's a control id here for

385
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
the nist

386
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
security control

387
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,680
the security control name the mapping

388
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,560
type

389
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,959
the miter attack technique id and then

390
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,759
the miter attack technique name

391
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
let's say that you're looking at a layer

392
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,320
and you see that there's a specific

393
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
technique

394
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,360
that maps to ac-16

395
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,079
unless you have all of these nist

396
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,440
control ids and control names memorized

397
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
you're not going to know what that is

398
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,079
if you do have these all memorized you

399
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,519
deserve a medal

400
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,920
or at least a trophy

401
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,360
so you could look up the

402
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,360
acdesk-16 on here and see

403
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
that it is the security and privacy

404
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,440
attributes control

405
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,000
so as i said before for my demo i'm

406
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,720
going to use use case number four

407
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,519
and we are going to determine

408
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,880
which of the nist

409
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,880
800-53 security controls

410
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
will mitigate

411
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,640
the techniques used by a specific group

412
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,000
the first step is going to be to open

413
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,640
the layers so we're going to go

414
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,480
well i actually have already downloaded

415
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,119
the layer but if i had it we would go to

416
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,280
the frameworks folder on the attack

417
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,679
mappings github page

418
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,840
and then we'll go to attach version 9

419
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,039
and download the nest 800

420
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,840
800-53r5 overview layer

421
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,400
that will download it as a json file and

422
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,480
then we would open it up in the attack

423
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
navigator

424
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,360
each family within the github page does

425
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,080
contain multiple overview and mapping

426
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,480
layers there's a lot of them

427
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,520
so you can layer upon layer within a

428
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,600
text navigator it would take some

429
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
practice i think but depending on what

430
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
your scope is

431
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
you might find that useful as well

432
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,360
the next step is to customize the layer

433
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,679
for the thread group so once the layer's

434
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,799
been open i'm going to go to the

435
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,960
selection controls

436
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,200
and then i am going to

437
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
select the threat group

438
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
i have decided to use samara as my

439
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,039
threat group because i like the name

440
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,760
once the threat group's been checked or

441
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,120
selected

442
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,280
the techniques that are known to be used

443
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,600
by the threat group will will change to

444
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,559
be outlined in a black border they're

445
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,280
not that easy to see they're really hard

446
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,200
to pick out from just the white

447
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,960
non-bordered ones

448
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,679
so

449
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,640
i'm going to choose background color to

450
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,400
make them easier to see right away

451
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,240
and then after that i'm going to filter

452
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,039
my

453
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,360
platform down to just windows we'll say

454
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,160
that i work in a windows shop and right

455
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,640
now i'm just concerned with seeing

456
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,520
what

457
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,840
techniques this group is going to use

458
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,400
potentially use to

459
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,520
come after my windows devices

460
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,840
so here's an example of my how my layer

461
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
would look i'm going as i said i'm going

462
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,960
to select the threat groups chamera my

463
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,520
background color is going to be purple

464
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,600
elaine why would you use purple

465
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,760
i don't know i work for a purple team

466
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,960
company my hair is purple and it's also

467
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,880
my favorite color which is why science

468
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,400
hired me

469
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,799
and then the platform will be windows so

470
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,360
the purple techniques the purple boxes

471
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,799
in this example

472
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,440
are all techniques used by chamera when

473
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,039
attacking windows devices

474
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,120
when you hover over each technique

475
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,000
there's a little pop-up box that shows

476
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
it will show you the

477
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,039
the

478
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,720
miter attack

479
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
title the technique title

480
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,720
the id number so this is t1047

481
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,120
the score the score is the number of

482
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,760
possible mitigation controls that would

483
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,400
apply to that technique and then the

484
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,080
list of the nist security controls

485
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,600
as noted below that

486
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,799
so now we're going to

487
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,120
give things to the demogods and hope

488
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,479
that this goes smoothly

489
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,240
first thing i'm going to do is go to

490
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,480
attack navigator

491
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,720
and open an existing layer

492
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,039
and upload from local because i already

493
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,320
saved my overview layer

494
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,919
i'm not going to upgrade the layer to

495
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,159
attack version 10 because the nest

496
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,880
mappings haven't been updated yet so

497
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,799
we're going to open and attack version

498
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,120
9.

499
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,039
it does take a little bit to load um

500
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,799
sometimes it loads quicker sometimes

501
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,880
it's slower i guess it just depends on

502
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,039
the amount of use on the site or your

503
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
connection

504
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,520
so you can see here that it did open the

505
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,919
overview layer and some of the boxes

506
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,679
already have a variation of blue in them

507
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,120
some are just white

508
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,039
the boxes that are white the techniques

509
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,440
here that are just white have no nist

510
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,480
controls tied to them at all

511
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,559
whereas the blue boxes the lighter

512
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,280
colored blue box has the

513
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,360
lower number of missed controls this one

514
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
has a score of one

515
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,080
it has one nest control tied to it

516
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
where the darker box the darker

517
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,559
techniques have more controls

518
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,919
this one has 24 and then there's 24ness

519
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,760
controls noted in the comments

520
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,679
first thing i'm going to do is select my

521
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,520
threat group so i'm going to go to the

522
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,679
little magnifying glass under selection

523
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,320
controls

524
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,159
and then the sidebar will open

525
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
you can see here that you have

526
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
techniques to choose from threat groups

527
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
software and mitigations

528
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
you can mix and match you don't have to

529
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
select just one item

530
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,200
again it really depends on what your

531
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
scope and focus are

532
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,280
i'm searching for shimara because i

533
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,799
already know

534
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,120
that i'm selecting just a thread group

535
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,799
now if you look here on these white

536
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,799
boxes these are probably the easiest

537
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,880
ones to see when they become outlined in

538
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,440
black when i select the chameras some of

539
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,480
these are outlined in black

540
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,120
again still not that easy to

541
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,960
to see if i hadn't told you about it you

542
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
may not have noticed i didn't notice the

543
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,640
first couple times that i used them

544
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,159
so the next step i'm going to select my

545
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,919
background color

546
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,600
conveniently they have a purple that

547
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,320
matches my hair

548
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,400
now you can see the techniques used by

549
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,840
shimara much

550
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,440
easier they kind of they just pop right

551
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,679
out

552
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,640
next step is to filter down to just the

553
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,400
windows platform

554
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,360
all of the platforms are selected

555
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,080
there's linux mac windows azure office

556
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,039
says

557
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,840
google workspace docker

558
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,360
there's a lot of choices here

559
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,600
again for this example we're just going

560
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,760
to drill down to windows

561
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,559
as i deselect these other options you'll

562
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,720
see that the number of techniques

563
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,440
decreases

564
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,400
now we're looking at techniques used by

565
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
chamera

566
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,159
that are

567
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,640
targeted toward windows

568
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,520
sorry sometimes it is slow like i said

569
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
the ones with the yellow underline do

570
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
have

571
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,400
nist controls tied to them or the ones

572
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
that don't have a yellow underlined have

573
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,880
no nist controls

574
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,240
my suggestion would be if if there are a

575
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
lot of techniques showing up that have

576
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
no nist controls tied to them

577
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
that you investigate these these

578
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,679
techniques

579
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,760
get gather a lot more information on

580
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
them maybe what processes are used what

581
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
kind of logs are generated and then

582
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,279
tweak your security tools to detect

583
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,919
alert and even block

584
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,320
because there's not really any other way

585
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,080
to mitigate those right now you want to

586
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,000
make sure you know that these

587
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,240
these activities are going on in your

588
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,240
network

589
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,840
there's also an option here

590
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
to

591
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,200
expand so you can see the sub techniques

592
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,159
this is

593
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,679
more than likely something that you're

594
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,919
going to want to do if you're really if

595
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,679
you're working on a project and really

596
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,240
digging it

597
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,520
and then there's other controls as well

598
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,080
there's a way to add comments you can

599
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,720
change scores you can really customize

600
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
this to your needs

601
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,799
the other thing i do want to point out

602
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,880
is that this is web-based

603
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,760
so

604
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,080
make sure you download your layer as a

605
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,960
json file when you're done tweaking the

606
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,120
layer and customizing it the last thing

607
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,200
you want to do is spend a couple hours

608
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,720
working on this

609
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,679
and then close the web page and lose it

610
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,000
all so be sure you download it before

611
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,159
you're done

612
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,279
there's also an option to download as a

613
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,840
spreadsheet as a excel file

614
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,039
this is kind of cool it comes it opens

615
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,600
as the layer

616
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,279
so

617
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,640
uh

618
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,720
this could be another way that you could

619
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
kind of

620
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,799
look up the different controls for each

621
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,159
technique

622
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,279
you can mouse over the little red corner

623
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,679
here to see the comment the comment

624
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,440
shows the different controls that are

625
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,039
mitigated

626
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,880
and then you could go to the nist

627
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,360
to miter mapping spreadsheet to look

628
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,480
them up and from there you could start

629
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
creating your plan

630
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,760
you know assuming that maybe you don't

631
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,679
have some type of software that could

632
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,919
correlate that for you that's another

633
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,919
option

634
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,159
i do want to thank the demogods for

635
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,640
being kind to me and not harassing me

636
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,880
this time i'm sure they'll make up for

637
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,679
it next time

638
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,799
so i'm hoping that i've shown you some

639
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,120
some of the ways that

640
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
the attack navigator and miss mappings

641
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,360
can benefit the blue team

642
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,640
again you can

643
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,720
as a blue teamer you can use the

644
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,360
information to review the nest controls

645
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,000
for each technique identified or even

646
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,840
just learn more about what techniques

647
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,640
are going to be used by which groups

648
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,279
again i did state previously that this

649
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,480
can be customized you can add scores to

650
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,159
prioritize the higher risk gaps like you

651
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,039
could

652
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,159
add a score and a comment to a technique

653
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,760
that is a really high risk that you

654
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,320
don't have a control in place for

655
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,240
and then

656
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
the techniques that you already have

657
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,919
controls in place for you could add

658
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,240
scores or change the color or add notes

659
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,480
to that as well

660
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,399
this tool is going to help you to

661
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,559
identify security gaps

662
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,600
and when when you know what the gaps are

663
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,919
you can also identify what tools you

664
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,240
might already have available to mitigate

665
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,880
those gaps

666
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,320
we talked about

667
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,919
sorry we talked about

668
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,559
tweaking your policies and your existing

669
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,799
security applications your sim or your

670
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,320
firewall to deduct alert or block on

671
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,360
these

672
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,120
techniques that may not have any

673
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,520
controls tied to them or obviously that

674
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,120
do have controls tied to them and you

675
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,159
can just add that extra layer

676
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,720
and then as you close the security gaps

677
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,679
by adding in more security controls you

678
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,960
can go back to your layer and

679
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,360
remove those particular techniques or

680
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,159
change the color coding or scoring to

681
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,000
show that you've made progress in

682
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,559
closing gaps

683
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,360
lastly this can also show an overlap in

684
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,840
security controls

685
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,720
again by adding to the visualization

686
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,480
you'll know which techniques have

687
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,559
multiple controls in place

688
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,120
to protect against it and that's

689
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,320
creating your defense in depth

690
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,559
organizations can really benefit from

691
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,440
using this to start with it's free who

692
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,600
doesn't love free

693
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,320
this is a well-known and

694
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,480
mitre attacking mister very well known

695
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,640
in the information security world and

696
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,039
associated with best practices for

697
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,399
security

698
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,640
so it's it's well trusted it's free

699
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,840
and they're updated often

700
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
another reason an organization or

701
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
security department might benefit from

702
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,559
this

703
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,720
is that they can they can relay

704
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,960
technical information to non-technical

705
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,840
people

706
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,000
suppose your cso has to report to the

707
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,880
board

708
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,000
you can

709
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,200
create one of these layers and

710
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,320
show the board in a visualizing a visual

711
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,919
way

712
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,240
where your gaps are or

713
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
where they are in

714
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,200
leaders can also utilize these

715
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,480
visualizations to ask for money to

716
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
justify

717
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
you know new projects and requesting

718
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,919
more resources or more security

719
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,640
applications

720
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,080
i've included the links to my two-part

721
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,399
blog series i'm hoping that you did find

722
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,399
this to be an interesting talk and you

723
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,360
might want to pursue utilizing the tools

724
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,200
so in the blogs i do have the

725
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,640
step-by-step

726
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,440
like i did for the demo to help you out

727
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
i probably should have mentioned at the

728
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,080
beginning that you didn't have to take

729
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,399
notes because the blog links are here

730
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,360
if you did

731
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,279
take notes then you've got double

732
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,960
documentation and you're good to go

733
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,360
i would like to thank micah brown he was
