00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,880
and my talk on

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,599
all the data and why death by alerts and

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,559
logging is bad

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
so who am i and why should you care what

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,399
i have to say

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,120
well i have over 25 years of it and

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,960
security experience

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,800
i started

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,520
on a tandy 486 that we got from radio

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,480
shack if anybody remembers those

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,559
i upgraded to a whole eight megabytes of

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,600
ram

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
got into da shell to play duke nukem and

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
i've been traveling ever since going

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
down this path

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,319
uh first and foremost i am a father

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,000
to my three beautiful children i have

25

last five years i moved into cyber

34
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,680
security

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
where i was the lone cyber analyst for

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,079
my unit for those without a military

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,720
background think about it as a small to

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
mid-size organization about a thousand

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,280
people

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,000
um i did compliance analyst

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
jack of all trades master of none

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
i am a part-time security researcher i

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
do have a full-time job with tanium i'm

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
an enterprise service engineer

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,720
and my focus is on security operations

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,040
i'm a lifelong learner i love learning

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,640
new things i try to learn something new

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
every day

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,079
you can see some of my certifications on

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,560
the right a lot of knowledge a huge

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
history buff both military and

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,878
regular history

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,120
but enough about me this is all about

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,920
you

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
and why you're here

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,239
we're gonna go on a journey today

57
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,319
we're gonna talk about where we are

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,599
today with log event collections

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,080
the data you need how to make your data

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
more effective

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,520
and really we're going to focus heavily

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,480
on how to reduce alert fatigue

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,319
so over the next

64
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,920
25

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,760
ish minutes we're going to talk heavily

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,040
on these topics

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
so where we are today

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,879
alert fatigue is real folks

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,879
like if you are a sock analyst a

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,160
responder

71
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,879
anybody that has ever done any type of

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,120
work in this realm

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,879
you know it's real

74
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,040
because we collect

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
way too much data

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,959
data we don't need

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
events we don't need

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
all kinds of fud that come from our

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,760
firewalls network devices and everywhere

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,959
so

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,560
i have a screen capture that i pulled

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
down from security onion

83
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
this is squeal

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,159
if you're not familiar with security

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,040
onion

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
and squeal squeal provides a pane of

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,319
glass one pane of glass for all your

88
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,000
your events

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
but it could be your elk stack your

90
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
splunk instance

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,440
whatever

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,400
seam

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
logging device that you're using

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,200
when you come in

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
on your work day

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,519
you don't want to see that little

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,200
button over there you don't want to see

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
it that small

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,360
but why does it get so small again

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,640
we collect

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,720
thousands of events

102
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,200
and we don't need that many events

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
you don't want to see that because you

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
know you're going to have a bad shift

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,360
trying to go through all those events

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,560
so why do we collect so much data

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
well there could be a multitude of

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
reasons

109
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,239
but the two primary ones we are going to

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,599
focus on

111
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,799
is

112
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,959
usually we collect too much data for

113
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,519
regulatory and compliance

114
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,600
things of that nature

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
and management decisions

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,720
because in today's world

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,400
every corporation

118
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
or every customer doesn't want to be the

119
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,080
next target

120
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
they don't want to be hit by the next

121
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
ransomware

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,479
so

123
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,000
management will sometimes make the

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
decision

125
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
that we need to collect all this data

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,160
to make us to make them feel safe that

127
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
all that data will provide better

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,720
incident response and that's just not

129
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,400
the case

130
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,880
going through thousands of alerts trying

131
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,680
for

132
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
trying to find what your responders need

133
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
it just makes life difficult

134
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,120
again

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,600
way way way too much data is collected

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
and passed into our seams

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
and it provides

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,400
little to no value

139
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,080
compliance

140
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
it's out there folks like you're not

141
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,400
going to get rid of it it's it's just a

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,360
thing

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
that is going to keep getting worse so

144
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
much compliance if you work in commerce

145
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
you have to deal with pci if you have

146
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,240
european partners you have

147
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
gdpr

148
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,479
if you work in the fed space you have

149
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,160
the cyber security maturity model

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,479
fisma if you work in medical you have

151
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,639
hipaa

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,800
iso

153
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,440
27001 the international standard

154
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,440
and these are just a few that i've

155
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,560
listed

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,880
but there are over 150 regulatory

157
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
frameworks out there

158
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
i pull that from secure controls

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,039
framework they have a nice excel sheet

160
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,120
that breaks it all down

161
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,639
if you are an auditor and you have to

162
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,880
deal with this more power to you

163
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,360
because there are so many compliant

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
complainatory regulations out

165
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,960
and more and more coming out every day

166
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
with the next attack

167
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
or the next thing that pops up there's

168
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
usually another compliance piece that

169
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
follows it

170
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,719
so we have to collect that data

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
breaches

172
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
breaches again

173
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
hard to prevent

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,280
over 5200 breaches last year alone

175
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
and more and more we're not out of 2021

176
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
yet

177
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,560
so who knows

colonial pipeline

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,840
we all heard about that one all over the

184
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
breaches happen

185
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,919
and they happen every day

186
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,160
more and more and with everyone's

log 4j

189
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,319
there have been no breaches that i know

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,360
of

191
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,319
major breaches reported due to log 4j

192
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,759
but it's coming

193
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,680
like we can we might as well just accept

194
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
the fact that it's coming and we just

195
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,919
need to be prepared for it if you want

196
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,599
to look at all the breaches go pull the

197
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
verizon breach report it's a good model

198
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,440
it's good reference so you can track all

199
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,080
your track the breaches

200
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,280
and find out more about them

201
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
so

202
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
why don't i need all this data that i'm

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
getting

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,039
i'm getting

205
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,199
thousands upon thousands of thousands of

206
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,879
alerts every day

207
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
why don't i need it

208
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,199
well you don't need all the data because

209
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,479
there's only a small subset piece

210
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,479
that can really be useful in an incident

211
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,680
response now

212
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
you need to make sure you have that

213
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,479
subset piece you want quality data not

214
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
quantitative data

215
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,080
and in today's environment we've seen a

216
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,680
lot of just

217
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,879
quantity

218
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,840
not quality

219
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
so for your incident responders to be

220
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,599
effective you need to make sure you're

221
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,000
providing them quality data and you get

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,479
that by having quality alerts quality

223
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,880
logging

224
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,719
too much data slows down our tools and

225
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,200
increasing latency

226
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
and

227
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,839
as we know

228
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,120
time is money

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
internet speed

230
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,160
is money

231
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
ask amazon how much money they lost a

232
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,279
couple weeks ago

233
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,200
if you work especially if you work in

234
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
the commerce area

235
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,160
your network goes down you're losing

236
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
money every single second that that

237
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,760
network goes down and you don't want

238
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,519
that to happen you don't want to push

239
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,200
all that data across your network

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040
we process a lot of useless data

241
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
you

242
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,560
you do you don't need to know

243
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,720
when every time somebody goes to google

244
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
and it increases false positives it

245
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,399
takes time from the analyst

246
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,160
to

247
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
siphon through that data

248
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,839
and if they report something they

249
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,160
believe to an incident to the responders

250
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,640
it takes the responders time

251
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,519
and false positives take time away

252
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,200
from something that could really be

253
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,279
going on in our network

254
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,680
so again i'm going to repeat myself

255
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,800
quality

256
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
over quantity

257
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
these are things that we need to make

258
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
sure happen

259
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,720
but now

260
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,959
how do we do that

261
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,640
how do we handle

262
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,519
compliance management and like i said

263
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,680
this is a journey we're traveling we're

264
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,320
gonna get there

265
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,279
so

266
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,360
i'm not at if you're an analyst you're

267
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,480
an ir guy you're a threat hunter

268
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,519
i'm not asking you to know

269
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,680
the compliance regulations but you

270
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,360
should have an understanding of what

271
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
those regulations

272
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,160
are

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
and the type of data you collect with

274
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
those regulations

275
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,600
so

276
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
you have the understanding so you can

277
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
talk to your management team sit down

278
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,160
with your auditing team in your legal

279
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
team and say hey

280
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
are we collecting everything that we

281
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,320
require or are we collecting more

282
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,839
and if we are collecting more do we

283
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,360
really need it like

284
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
all we're doing is filling up space and

285
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
getting useless alerts

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
you don't want to collect more than is

287
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
required

288
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
unless it's a customer ask

289
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,200
it's all about your customer and your

290
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
environment

291
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,920
again these are methods

292
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,600
that i have used

293
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
they may not be right

294
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,680
the right way there's no one right way

295
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,959
but try to trim down your compliance

296
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,839
and if you can store it somewhere else

297
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,959
stored in aws instance store in azure

298
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
stored in a server

299
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,040
it can always be there if you need to go

300
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
back and reference it

301
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
for an incident

302
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,200
but try not to push it into your scene

303
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,519
because you want to cut down on those

304
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,920
noisy alerts that keep coming in just

305
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,800
for compliance sake

306
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
management

307
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
the human element so what can we do

308
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
about management

309
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,839
well we gotta have those hard

310
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,399
conversations with managers

311
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,040
and say look there's too much

312
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,440
like i can't go through a thousand

313
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,839
alerts a day the team can't go through

314
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,519
all these alerts

315
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
we're having false positives we're

316
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
taking too much time

317
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,120
but also while you're having that

318
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,800
conversation find out what management's

319
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,639
end goal is

320
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,560
maybe there's a reason they have they're

321
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,680
collecting all the data

322
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
find out that end goal and try to meet

323
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
in that middle ground

324
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,519
you need to reduce your alerts

325
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,399
for quality alerts

326
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,680
but brian

327
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,279
what do i do about that one manager

328
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,240
that just won't hear it we need all the

329
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,920
data because i say we need all the data

330
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
okay

331
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,440
so in the military

332
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
the trick i learned

333
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,120
was you have to show them them upper

334
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,720
managements and then c levels the

335
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
metrics

336
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,000
because it's hard for someone to argue

337
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
with data

338
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
they may want to

339
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,040
but if you show it to them

340
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
in black and white

341
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,839
they can't argue with it

342
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,680
so take your team

343
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,440
do your due diligence

344
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,040
and say for instance

345
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,399
say for example you have a splunk

346
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,200
instance and it's costing your company

347
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
three million dollars

348
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,120
annually to run this splunk instance

349
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,440
you do your due diligence try to you see

350
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
what you can take out what's effective

351
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,279
what's not effective and go back and

352
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,120
show up for management present it to

353
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,839
them

354
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,839
and say hey

355
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,680
if we cut down this we're still

356
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,279
effective actually we're twice as

357
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,040
effective because we're not taking our

358
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
time we're not taking up too much time

359
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
going through noisy alerts

360
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,839
and we can save our customer

361
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
x amount of money and then take x amount

362
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,600
of money and turn it into your training

363
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
budget

364
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
but always remember you sometimes you

365
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
have to show

366
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
why your way is more effective that your

367
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,199
time is money

368
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,320
and metrics and data it's hard to argue

369
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,279
with those things they may try

370
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,839
but it's hard

371
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,680
so

372
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
this is a method

373
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,320
again

374
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,560
it is one way to do things is a

375
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,279
three-step method

376
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,680
it is not by no means

377
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
going to be sufficient for everyone

378
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,040
but step one for data collection and how

379
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,040
to reduce your alerts and your noise

380
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,480
start with logging and tagging your

381
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,880
compliance data now that you've talked

382
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,639
to your compliance team and your legal

383
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,880
team and you found out exactly what you

384
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,680
need

385
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
tag it and bag it no more no less

386
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,480
and if you can again

387
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,639
get it out of your scene

388
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,440
store it somewhere else

389
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,399
and that'll help reduce the noise

390
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,160
once you've got your compliance and your

391
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,519
regulatory

392
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,240
alerts and logs set

393
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,880
you move on to step two

394
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
you switch to

395
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
logging for intrusion detection purposes

396
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,839
and i've listed a few examples detect

397
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,360
what's a log

398
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,120
incident response

399
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,399
malware

400
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,199
windows security there's thousands and

401
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,680
thousands of references out there

402
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,320
and i have more later in the slide but

403
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
find out what's works for you find out

404
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,560
what works for your customer

405
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,880
because that's the end goal

406
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,600
to support your customer

407
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,040
and once you do that focus on your

408
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,199
deeper logging your powershell your

409
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,639
command line

410
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,959
eric conrad gives a great talk

411
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
on what to log

412
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
now i'm extremely passionate about seam

413
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
tuning and logging

414
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,360
and here's why

415
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,000
back when i was a young sock

416
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
analyst security guy

417
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,959
we got my brand new shiny software my

418
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:53,759
seem

419
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,360
vendor agnostic

420
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,320
be any scene you want

421
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,160
i installed it i got it going and i

422
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,519
thought man i'm going to be the world's

423
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,440
greatest stock analyst

424
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,720
i want everything

425
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,560
so

426
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
had everything going

427
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,600
i come in the next morning

428
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,680
alerts i'm surprised the appliance

429
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,519
didn't start smoking

430
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,199
so many alerts don't even remember

431
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,880
exactly how many but so many so 12 hours

432
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
and a bottle of advil later

433
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,680
i finally got through all the alerts

434
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
and i learned that day that failure

435
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
is the greatest teacher

436
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,639
so i started doing my due diligence my

437
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,920
research going to google saying hey what

438
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,600
event logs do i need what event ids

439
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,560
do i need everything from the firewall

440
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,160
you know what's going to make me more

441
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,680
effective

442
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,959
so i learned that day that all the data

443
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,720
is bad

444
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,040
because makes your eyes hurt and your

445
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,519
head hurt

446
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,839
so anyone that's ever taken a security

447
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,839
course or anything this is the first

448
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,799
thing

449
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,280
know your environment

450
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,880
and this is going to come with time and

451
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,480
experience you're not going to walk

452
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,640
through the door day one as a sock

453
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,520
analyst or an ir and know everything

454
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,240
so understand and have patience but

455
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,880
understand your common ip space

456
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,199
your common ports applications you have

457
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,199
in your environments your username and

458
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,640
convention your computer naming

459
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,319
convention

460
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,720
so if you understand those things and

461
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
you see those noisy common alerts that

462
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
come in

463
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,919
you know what to look for and you can

464
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,400
quickly market and move on market and

465
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,280
move on market move on until you can

466
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
find something that comes

467
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,160
that looks interesting

468
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,039
so

469
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,039
when i was in

470
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,960
i had

471
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
an alert come across i had two computers

472
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,640
talking to each other

473
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,559
and we know that's bad

474
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,640
like no computers talk to computers

475
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,600
right

476
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,360
so i went to the firewall guy and said

477
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,520
hey block them

478
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,760
well i come to find out for those that

479
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,559
don't have military background

480
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,799
certain applications that we have do

481
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,799
funky things

482
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
and it was two computers talking to each

483
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,799
other passing data to each other

484
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,120
to push up to a server and it was for a

485
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,840
big exercise

486
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
it's very interesting to explain why i

487
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,720
did that

488
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,280
but again i never took the time to talk

489
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,600
to my stakeholders

490
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,320
the application users and find out why

491
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,039
what do they use what are their ports

492
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,280
i learned a lot that day

493
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,240
talk to everybody all your stakeholders

494
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,799
understand your critical assets

495
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,880
you know so you know

496
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,919
hey

497
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,840
my server's called this and i'm seeing a

498
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,120
lot of funky stuff going to that server

499
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
so you can hone in on it maybe do a

500
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,840
little bit more analysis

501
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,840
and try to learn your network and

502
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,799
applications as good as your red team

503
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,400
you know volunteer for purple team

504
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
engagements they're really going to help

505
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,919
you focus

506
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,840
and find out what you need

507
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
make friends

508
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,600
you know reach out to your stakeholders

509
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
as i said earlier

510
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,440
why do you do that because if you know

511
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,720
[Music]

512
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,480
what your firewall is trying to collect

513
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
if you know what your edr is trying to

514
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
collect what their purpose is

515
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,640
what they actually need what your ir

516
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,440
team needs to be successful

517
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
they can cut down on the noi you can cut

518
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
down on the noise it's all about quality

519
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,679
as i've said

520
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,240
quality quality alerts

521
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,840
in your scene

522
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,679
and if you know what

523
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,280
they need you can help facilitate that

524
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,320
you don't

525
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,360
we all try to be in a silo

526
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,720
you don't need to be this is a team

527
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
effort that's the only way we're going

528
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,400
to stop threat actors if we all work

529
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
together

530
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,280
so

531
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,520
talk to your teams and

532
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,799
they can see

533
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,720
tell you hey this is what we're blocking

534
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,280
at the firewall this is why

535
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
this is what you need to look out for

536
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,600
and it'll make you a better analyst

537
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,720
be a part of the community

538
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,480

you know always open for questions and

546
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,120

557
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,679
thought i knew

558
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,480

563
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,600
your environment what do you do in your

564
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,799
environment

565
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,159
will help make

566
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,720
you a better analyst and help solidify

567
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,440
your environment

568
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,480
lab

569
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,640
lab lab lab lab lab

570
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
if you are in the cyber security field

571
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,559
and you do not have a lab you're

572
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,799
probably not doing it right

573
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,440
and i'm not saying you need a massive

574
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,159
dell server farm lab

575
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,120
no

576
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
but you should at least

577
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,039
mimic what your company has

578
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,320
go on

579
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
ebay and get you a

580
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,559
a cheap refurb server and try to build

581
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,320
it out as best you can whether it's

582
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
splunk elk

583
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,919
he radar any vendor

584
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,640
throw you a couple clients on there

585
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,080
and go go get atomic red team or caldera

586
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
and practice your craft

587
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
run those attacks

588
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,880
so you know what those events look like

589
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
and you can hone in

590
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,039
and tune your systems at work

591
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,919
you are playing the ultimate nerd sport

592
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,520
and if you don't think the offense is

593
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,799
practicing

594
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,799
you're wrong you need to practice your

595
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,600
defense too

596
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,400
so

597
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
as i said more resources

598
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,600
this is very sans heavy i am in no way

599
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,080
promoting sans i know their courses are

600
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
very expensive but they do have a lot of

601
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
free good

602
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
information out there they have the blue

603
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,080
team github

604
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,919
their cyber defense and training

605
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,400
resources on their website

606
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,320
and the sans blue team wiki all

607
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,720
fantastic free resources

608
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,480
and right now and for the foreseeable

609
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,240
future i believe most of their

610
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,960
conferences are virtual and free so if

611
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
you get a chance check them out

612
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,879
sans is a great tool

613
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,159
continue your quest for knowledge

614
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,320
lifelong learner it's it's one of the

615
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,640
traits you need to have in this business

616
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,880
to keep up with things that are going on

617
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,400
in the world

618
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,159
there are

619
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,240
thousands of resources these are a few

620
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,720
of my favorites uh the blue team field

621
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,320
manual

622
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,280
the blue team handbook

623
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
it's really good for socks seams and

624
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,360
threat hunters all these books are very

625
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,679
small

626
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,080
fit in a desk drawer fit in your go bag

627
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,159
the operator's handbook has a lot of red

628
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,320
team purple team blue team little bit of

629
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,679
everything

630
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,280
fantastic book

631
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,039
fantastic book

632
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,279
and the last one the hacker playbook

633
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,200
series

634
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,720
but brian you've spent all this time

635
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,600
talking about blue team why hacker

636
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,440
well

637
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,000
these books give you kind of a guideline

638
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
if you've never read them

639
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,480
kind of a a model of how red teams and

640
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,279
atps do their thing

641
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,279
and if you lab that

642
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,919
and you read it and you practice it

643
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,080
you could incorporate that stuff in your

644
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,200
scenes

645
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,640
and in your logs

646
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,760
again quality quality alerts to reduce

647
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,000
the fatigue

648
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
because you know if you put garbage in

649
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,879
you're gonna get garbage out

650
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,440
so those are my tips and tricks as

651
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,200
always you're gonna hear it

652
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,360
if you continue in cyber security rit

653
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,840
you're gonna hear this know your

654
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,080
environment make friends make friends in

655
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
your environment make friends outside of

656
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,400
work because that community knowledge

657
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
that we all have

658
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,000
you know somebody out there may have a

659
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,039
way

660
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,480
that is better than what you're doing it

661
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,279
lab lab lab lab i can't say it enough

662
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,720

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,000
your craft

664
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,559

if not thousands more

670
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,919
and always continue your quest for

671
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,559
knowledge youtube read a book
