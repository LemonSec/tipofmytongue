following this discussion but what i'd

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,920
like to first take you to

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,239
is

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,480
a place

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,239
uh back in 2000

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
2004

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,280
and so in 2004 uh a younger

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,599
me was a company commander in

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,879
afghanistan in iraq uh we just spent

88
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,879
over a year uh

89
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,159
in combat

90
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,080
flying over baghdad supporting uh a 39

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,159
000 person organization

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,400
spread across baghdad

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,319
and we thought we were going home and so

94
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
we were we were relaxing

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
sitting down uh

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,239
folding up our aircraft getting ready to

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,120
leave

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,720
uh this place called uh iraq in order to

99
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,959
go home

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,480
but unfortunately

101
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
uh i got a call from a commit my

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,599
commander my boss who said hey

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,760
the decision has been made

104
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,840
that you and your team have to go back

105
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,519
to combat

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,280
have to go back to a place you've been

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,239
flying over primarily because

108
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,560
over the previous five to seven days

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
while we were gone

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
other aircraft had been shot down and

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
the decision was made that we were the

112
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,560
closest uh and were able to jump back in

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
to the fight and support

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,759
and help extend operations

115
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
not just in baghdad but further south

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,440
and so

117
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,520
me as a young

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,320
captain had to explain to my team this

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,479
group of gentlemen on the screen

120
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,520
that hey

121
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,000
you're not going home to see your family

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
i need you to get ready in 48 hours to

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,240
jump back on those iron horses and get

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,479
back in the fight

125
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,840
because our nation needs us right

126
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,600
now so it had nothing to do with the

127
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,199
technical expertise they were these were

128
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,360
all professionals these are all amazing

129
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,440
pilots amazing crew members who played

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
amazing maintainers and amazing

131
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
non-commissioned officers who could get

132
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,960
the mission done

133
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
it absolutely nothing to do with their

134
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
technical competence that i had to focus

135
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,479
on i had to focus on how do i influence

136
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,840
persuade

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,600
and inspire

138
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
these individuals to jump back into

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,840
the fire of a combat zone

140
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
this is very similar to what

141
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
all of you been engaging in over not

142
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
only the past two years but over the arc

143
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,840
of your careers but more intensely over

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,919
the last few years as we think about how

145
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,039
has covet

146
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,320
impacted you and your teams how is the

147
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,759
shutdown open shutdown reality

148
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,440
exposed vulnerabilities in your

149
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,720
processes

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,320
and it's not the technological expertise

151
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
that you need to worry about

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
it's mainly the soft skills they're

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,759
actually the hard skills

154
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,639
so

155
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,960
i want to describe further describe this

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,759
new normal that we're in and suggest

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
uh how systems thinking a different way

158
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,039
of

159
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,319
looking at these problems or challenges

160
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,720
flip it to more opportunities and then

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,840
also suggest eight ways to consider

162
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,280
leading the remote teams and and our new

163
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
normal in which we are operating as a

164
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,000
few key takeaways

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
so i think we all remember

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
uh this kind of arc

167
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,919
2019 everything's going great they were

168
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,880
honest very similar to the summer and

169
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,680
and

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
the what's happening you know as we're

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,360
in the middle of the pandemic

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
and then we all became very

173
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,759
connected to this visual

174
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,840
the spikes this reality of this thing

175
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,720
called

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
covet 19.

177
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,720
we've all we've always been exposed to

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,759
coronavirus but this became a pretty

179
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,319
nasty situation that

180
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,080
for the first time for all of us

181
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
completely shut down the markets and had

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,400
us tumble really quickly

183
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,120
and we we noticed that it didn't just

184
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,120
hurt uh our partners and allies in asia

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
but also on the continent and actually

186
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,919
shut the globe down it's like a really

187
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,960
bad sci-fi movie that we all have

188
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
experience

189
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
but as we come into

190
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
2021

191
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
you know we're starting to see vaccines

192
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,919
um

193
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,440
folks are getting a shot and we think

194
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,479
we're good

195
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,199
everything's fantastic we're outside

196
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,960
we're engaged with each other we have

197
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,360
parties we're having gatherings we're

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
feeling good about ourselves

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
and then we've now all become very

200
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
connected

201
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
to this new variant omicron that's that

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,560
spreads faster

203
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
so now we almost have to take a lot of

204
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
the lessons that we've learned

205
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,840
and

206
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,360
re-imagine

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
uh and re-event how we're going to

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,759
operate with something that's even

209
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,680
that spreads even faster

210
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
but we don't want to shut down

211
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
and it completely changes our ideas of

212
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,520
what normal is this this term new normal

213
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,199
has been thrown around a lot over the

214
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,280
past couple years but i would argue that

215
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,759
it's really not a new normal it's just

216
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,960
become

217
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,720
our normal and we have to think about

218
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
how are we going to operate

219
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,960
and as we think about organizations that

220
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,759
emilia went to 100 remote some have said

221
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,440
they're going to remain remote

222
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,319
uh some try to bring people back these

223
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,160
are all the challenges in which we have

224
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,879
to deal with right now

225
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,879
because this has become

226
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
our normal with us engaging in this way

227
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,958
uh the world has now become even flatter

228
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,719
uh on the screens with little square

229
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,880
with uh squares and now we're trying to

230
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,519
be as productive as human possible

231
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
and even in that environment we have a

232
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,519
whole lot of folks who wish we could go

233
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,920
all the way back to 2019. we get back to

234
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,080
2019 back to the you know back to the

235
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
future we will be ecstatic

236
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,880
but we recognize now that maybe

237
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,920
this open office cubicle farm concept is

238
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,320
not going to come back anytime soon

239
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,200
so we're going to have to think about

240
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,440
the hybrid model how are we going to be

241
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
able to go in and out of this reality

242
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,959
effectively

243
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,320
as leaders

244
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,519
because again

245
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
similar to the combat zone it's not the

246
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
technical competence

247
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
that's the challenge it's our ability to

248
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,160
inspire persuade

249
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
others to want to engage

250
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,640
because

251
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
some of us can be in the office some of

252
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
us could be in this flat world but at

253
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,959
least from the organization that i spent

254
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,440
most of my adult life in the training

255
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,519
never stops we don't have that luxury

256
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,120
because we live in this vuca environment

257
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
and vuca

258
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,519
means volatile uncertain complex and

259
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,959
ambiguous

260
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,920
and so

261
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,519
if we think about

262
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
being in this kind of environment that

263
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
we're in it's very dynamic

264
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,000
there's things going on it's not linear

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,680
and we need

266
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,959
leaders

267
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,240
and teammates who are comfortable

268
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
being uncomfortable and are able to

269
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
consistently sustain the ability to

270
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,480
operate in this kind of environment

271
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,959
because the the world in which we

272
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,399
uh live in has a lot of kind of wicked

273
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,760
problems

274
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,079
the challenge is that sometimes our way

275
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,160
at approaching these problems is

276
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,399
sometimes a mismatch between what we

277
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,640
think is going to work

278
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
and what actually is going to work

279
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,040
so i like to suggest to you

280
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
maybe to take a a systems thinking

281
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,040
approach to this uh vuca world

282
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,720
and maybe change

283
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,040
your mental model and how you think

284
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
about

285
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,959
approaching the challenges that have

286
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,760
become uh ever present

287
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,079
in your reality

288
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,880
and so we think about this vuca world

289
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,160
this vulnerable certain complex and

290
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
bigger biggest environment

291
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
there's a real world reality

292
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,959
but a systems approach a way to think

293
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,200
about a systems approach is maybe

294
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,079
thinking about what are the distinctions

295
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,480
in the reality that we're operating what

296
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,040
are the systems that we have

297
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,959
what are the relationships and the

298
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,519
perspectives this is a system this is a

299
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,120
systems thinking framework there are

300
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,320
many this is one and this is taken from

301
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
my colleague at cornell derek cabrera at

302
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,120
the cabrera lab where

303
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
he's done extensive research on the dsrp

304
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,519
method because we have the real world

305
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,440
that has real boundaries

306
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
we throw things together

307
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,440
we create a bunch of systems

308
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,120
but sometimes you may forget the

309
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
interconnectedness of these systems and

310
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
they're in a massively complex way in

311
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,959
which you operate

312
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,240
and the dsrp allows us

313
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
to quickly

314
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,880
go in

315
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,959
figure out what those distinctions are

316
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,079
recognize that every large system can be

317
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,240
broken down into smaller groups because

318
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,560
it's easier to eat an elephant one bite

319
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,920
at a time

320
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,120
we can then distinguish those

321
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,480
relationships and recognize every

322
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,399
component every person

323
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
every division

324
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,760
has a perspective and you start to

325
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,040
understand

326
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,639
how to put yourself

327
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,600
in other shoes in order to attack and

328
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
smooth out challenges and problems

329
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,639
because this is the world that we're

330
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,279
living in uh it's challenging

331
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,680
there's cyber threats uh we're trying to

332
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,360
protect data

333
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
and so

334
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
we have the real world

335
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,760
but when we have that real world systems

336
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,160
you can approximate how it's going to be

337
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
you have some mental model

338
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,639
the world informs you and you're in a

339
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,160
constant loop

340
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
which means that you're

341
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
you have the real world you approximate

342
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,399
you leverage dsrp

343
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
to inform how you're going to

344
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,519
react to the world as it is

345
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,399
not

346
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,839
the world you wish it to

347
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,279
be because the reality is the training

348
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,079
must continue or in this case the way in

349
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,440
which you operate

350
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,120
must continue because

351
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
as we sit here

352
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,200
your organizations are being probed you

353
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,279
have folks trying to get after get the

354
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,680
data that that we have i mean although

355
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,399
technology integration has massively

356
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,279
made our lives easier it's for every new

357
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,399
technological

358
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,839
intervention

359
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,720
there's

360
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,279
five six hundreds of different branches

361
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,519
and sequels of challenges that we have

362
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
to engage in

363
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
and so

364
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
because training doesn't need to stop we

365
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,360
have to think about

366
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,880
how are we going to lead these remote

367
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,440
teams now this is something we've all

368
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,680
become very connected to over the past

369
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,839
two years if we think about most

370
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,160
organizations had less than 20 percent

371
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,480
of its uh population working in some

372
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
kind of remote uh status

373
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,560
and now even post pandemic that has gone

374
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,160
up to about 70 percent

375
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
and so when operating remote

376
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
environments

377
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
i would suggest that their teams and

378
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,000
they're leaders

379
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,040
and the scale is weighted towards the

380
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,360
leader

381
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,839
and so something that the leaders can do

382
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,639
is think about quickly

383
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,399
using a lead framework

384
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,079
how do we leverage the particular

385
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,920
platform there are many platforms go to

386
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,519
media and zoom

387
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,920
ms teams but what is the what is the

388
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,760
platform you're going to focus on and

389
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,399
ensure that all of your teams

390
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,240
are able to leverage in a meaningful way

391
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,639
and then how are you going to lean in as

392
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,920
a leader

393
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
leaning in means

394
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,000
leaning to the friction the friction of

395
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,240
what's really going on how do you really

396
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
measure productivity

397
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
how do you ensure your teammates are

398
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,560
doing okay what's going on behind the

399
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,199
screen that requires a frequency of

400
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,360
interactions to kind of get through the

401
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,839
friction and so you so leaders have to

402
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,320
engage

403
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,800
and by engaging you're able to adapt to

404
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,079
the environment and the seesaw effect of

405
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
we're going to all be fully remote we're

406
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,519
going to come in two to three days a

407
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,000
week we're gonna come in one day a week

408
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
we're gonna have this kind of cadence so

409
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
if you think about the way in which

410
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,160
you're adapting

411
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,639
are you adapting in a way that's almost

412
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,040
like whiplash to your teammates or are

413
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,759
you providing a level of predictability

414
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,880
that

415
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
enhances productivity

416
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,519
over time

417
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,600
and then

418
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,959
fundamental

419
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,160
for all leaders to be affected

420
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
is the ability to distill quickly

421
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,279
information and provide the important

422
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,639
points

423
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,399
in order to allow

424
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,600
your team

425
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,519
to operate effectively

426
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,560
because

427
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,880
no matter how much technology exists

428
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,920
no matter how buca the world is

429
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
when providing uh

430
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,079
when looking at surveys around what

431
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,519
makes effective or ineffective

432
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,360
organizations what makes effective or

433
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,839
ineffective

434
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,560
leaders it all comes back to

435
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
how does the leader communicate

436
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,880
and the way what the leader communicates

437
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,160
how does that leader make the team feel

438
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,079
and is it a psychologically safe

439
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,920
environment where everyone feels they

440
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,360
can speak up

441
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,279
are heard

442
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,880
is inclusive

443
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,639
uh and valued

444
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,680
and all of that is on the backs of

445
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
leaders no matter

446
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,959
what industry

447
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,839
we're operating in

448
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,680
and so

449
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,399
remote work requires far more managerial

450
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,839
engagement

451
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,759
and active engagement than when we're

452
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,600
just in the office and i think that's

453
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,199
that's something that we've all learned

454
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,359
over the past two years and i would

455
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
argue must be remembered

456
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,559
as we move through a sustained reality

457
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,640
of our current environment and as we

458
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,439
push through into the future because now

459
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
we're going to have a

460
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
second segment of the workforce that

461
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
really is very comfortable operating

462
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,720
remote

463
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,039
very comfortable operating in this

464
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,959
virtual world

465
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,320
and we have leaders who have to adapt to

466
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
being far more engaging

467
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,160
than prior to 2020.

468
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,640
and so i would suggest that you we think

469
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
about building agile

470
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,520
tech organizations it really just comes

471
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
back to some fundamentals

472
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
i suggest thinking about how do you love

473
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,640
the systems thinking approach

474
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,240
not very complex

475
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
just recognizing the world that you're

476
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,760
in

477
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,120
thinking through the mental model that

478
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,400
you have

479
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,720
the framework that you leverage in order

480
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,559
to be effective

481
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,520
and then

482
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,440
maybe think about leveraging lead

483
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,200
ensuring that the platform that you're

484
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
utilizing virtually and non-virtually or

485
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,919
hybrid is is the one that you need

486
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,440
leaning into the friction and not

487
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,200
running away from it

488
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,840
when you lean in your teams feel it when

489
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,200
you run away

490
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,400
your teams feel it and the reality is

491
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
people don't leave organizations

492
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,320
people leave people

493
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
and

494
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,160
think about how adaptive are you to the

495
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,320
environment you're in

496
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,000
do you feel comfortable in it are you

497
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,480
able to pivot when necessary i mean

498
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,559
those are some some

499
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,200
really self-reflections required to

500
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,559
really think about how adaptive you are

501
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,280
and how well do you distill

502
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,440
large values of information and plot the

503
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
important points and then share that

504
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,960
with your team

505
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,480
again communication is the key

506
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,200
to any organization to be effective for

507
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,039
any organization to scale

508
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,440
and in order to have an agile tech

509
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,039
organization

510
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,520
a lot is not necessarily the leader

511
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,919
who is the person on the keyboard who's

512
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,919
the person in the

513
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,400
the sock who is

514
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
when the breach happens is right there

515
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,400
at the keyboard

516
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,679
able to make a decision to influence the

517
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,160
reputational risk of the firm

518
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,440
then it's going to be based on the

519
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,520
information that that person has at the

520
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,840
time that the leaders at the time and

521
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,280
how much practice the team has had

522
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,200
across so

523
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,960
again communication

524
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,799
is imperative

525
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,160
i'd like to thank you all for your time

526
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
and attention i look real look forward

527
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,639

528
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,480
