00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,920
so you want to land a job in cyber

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,160
security but you look at the many many

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,400
areas of cyber security and you don't

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
know where to begin with

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
i'm don a current student studying

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,640
information security in this

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
presentation i will show you how i got

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
started things i did to help me to get

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,680
started with a career in cyber security

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,160
if you're new to infosec welcome i

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,320
wanted to share a little story of my own

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,719
how i got into cyber security

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,120
growing up i was this kid who likes to

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
poke around things and make use of

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,320
things creatively

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,559
in middle school i randomly browsed a

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,120
video that talks about ethical hacking

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
and i thought that was the coolest thing

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
in the world and i wanted to do that

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
so i browse the internet and people say

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,439
that in order to hack

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,760
you need to learn low level coding like

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
c programming

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
i learned how to code my first ever

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,680
program hello world nc

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
when the lying hello world exclamation

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
mark pops up on the command prompt i

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,640
feel like such an ethical hacker and i

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
feel like such a cool kid

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
and if you're thinking if the story is

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
going towards the direction of some

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
young genius hackers

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
i'm sorry i'm gonna let you be

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,799
disappointed so because of some

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,280
life-changing events i had to drop

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
i had to take home some family

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
responsibilities and had to drop

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
learning at the quahogy

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
fast forward to three years ago when i

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
just started college

44
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,479
i was still trying to figure out what i

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,520
wanted to do with my life and my family

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
really wants me to pursue a career in

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,640
law

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
but here's the thing so how american

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,640
school law school works is that you can

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,479
only earn your law degree after your

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,680
bachelor's

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
so i picked to have my undergrad degree

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
to business because i like people i like

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
talking to people

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
at the time i really enjoyed my first

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,560
business technology class

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
my professor mentioned that cyber

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
security is trending and in my major we

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
should check it out so i checked out my

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,239
school cyber security club and boom

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,640
this isn't the exact thing i wanted to

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,360
do

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,040
since middle school

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
i never knew that you could make a

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
career out of being a hacker

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,519
i have found my home and to be honest i

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,120
kind of regret not following through in

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
middle school with my passion

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
and i'm not letting myself regret it

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
again by dropping

71
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,400
as a result i started learning more

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
cyber security knowledge i got my

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
comptia security plus certification two

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
summers ago i also become more involved

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,440
in the cyber security club

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,920
on my in my university i became an

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
officer and i built the university of

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,280
women's cyber security chapter

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
currently i am a security advocate and i

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
go to a lot of conferences

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,680
and that helps shaping who i am and my

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,840
professional career which i will talk

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,080
about later

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,599
last year i tried for the first time

85
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
applying for cyber security internships

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,400
i found it really confusing because a

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,480
lot of job descriptions looks like the

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
following

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,720
an internship role that requires just a

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,840
lot

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,599
in-depth knowledge about networking

92
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,959
protocols

93
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,200
strong work experiences strong

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,519
experiences in scripting

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,840
and certification such as oscp cissp

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,799
which are definitely not interlocked

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
in particular cissp requires a candidate

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,439
to have at least

99
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,680
five years of security working

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
experiences and yet this role is for an

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,799
internship

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,280
there are many many examples like this

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
just getting into info just getting into

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
cyber security as a beginner i

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,920
definitely not did not have this many

106
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
experiences but i managed to have three

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
offers

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,918
so i don't want you to be scared away

109
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,720
because of the job qualifications

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,960
next i wanted to talk about a plan i

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,479
have for myself to land these offers

112
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,800
step number one is to get involved with

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
the community my tip of advice is to get

114
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,199
involved with the cyber security on

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
twitter and join discords and go to

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
conferences because that's the way that

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
you can get an understanding of which

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,440
certifications i should pursue next what

119
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,160
conference is everyone else going to and

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
what skills should i learn

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,800
step number two is to increase

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
face-to-face interactions

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
browsing twitter is a good way to get

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
information i like face to face because

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,639
you can get a small chat with a friendly

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
stranger while you're sitting next to

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
each other

128
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,639
and also with face to face is more real

129
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
to me because you're actually talking to

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,919
a person

131
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,360
you can do this step by going to

132
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
conferences meetups and hacker

133
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,000
associations

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,880
step number three is to apply and land a

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
job after we go to those conferences and

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,320
meet people it is show time for us to

137
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,560
apply follow up and land the job in

138
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
cyber security

139
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
and next i will explain in detail on

140
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
things how

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,440
that i did for those three steps

142
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,039
so there are many ways that we can get

143
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,120
involved with cyber security including

144
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,360
being active on twitter

145
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
at the first conference i went to

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,919
everyone was going by their hacker which

147
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,400
is their twitter handles and almost

148
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
everyone knows each other from twitter

149
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,000
and it's also a really good way to get

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
to know the most recent vulnerabilities

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
and cyber security professionals insight

152
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,840
into them which helps in terms of

153
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,080
interviews because they'll ask you

154
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,039
questions

155
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
um according to the most recent

156
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,039
vulnerabilities

157
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,039
i also liked playing capture the flag

158
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,240
competitions i played a couple of them

159
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,720
um and capture the flag competitions

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,919
also known as ctfs they're a jeopardy

161
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,199
style

162
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
gamified way of learning so what you do

163
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,120
is you solve a challenge you get a flag

164
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
you enter the flag and you get points

165
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,800
things with

166
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
ctf competitions is that

167
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,319
you can play it individually or you can

168
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,280
play it as a group

169
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
it's a really good way to learn cyber

170
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
security through going through a

171
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
hands-on way of learning

172
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,919
i i enjoy reading cyber security books

173
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,240
because they give you a general a really

174
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,080
in-depth knowledge on a particular topic

175
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,639
also studying certifications are a good

176
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,960
way because certifications give you

177
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
security knowledge in the theoretical

178
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
sometimes they give you a

179
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,400
practical knowledge in term depending on

180
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,680
which certification you are looking for

181
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,759
um one thing i wanted to know is that

182
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,520
for if you want to work in a large

183
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
company

184
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,880
um they use certifications to

185
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,039
differentiate their candidates

186
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,440
so in their their um hr screening resume

187
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,919
screening they'll look for specifically

188
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,599
which certifications

189
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,720
to differentiate um between candidates

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
to candidates so if you have this

191
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,560
certification it gives you a leg up

192
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
next one is connecting with cyber

193
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,880
security professionals on linkedin

194
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,120
i love this community and the

195
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
professionals in this community are

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,280
really really really helpful and so

197
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
friendly i would not hesitate to connect

198
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
with them on linkedin and ask your

199
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,000
questions away

200
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,120
i also listen to podcasts um usually

201
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
when i'm driving long distance where i'm

202
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,599
just driving in general if i wanted to

203
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,479
get my infosec news of the day i just go

204
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,479
ahead and listen to podcasts cast they

205
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,039
give me another perspective on what's

206
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,639
the most recent vulnerabilities

207
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,639
watching hands-on youtube videos also

208
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,960
really helped me because i get to see

209
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,919
from

210
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
another person's perspective of how they

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,800
did it versus um and how i should be

212
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,599
doing and if something goes wrong i just

213
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,639
google the the problem and boom it tells

214
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
me what to do and how i i knew that i

215
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,559
did it different from theirs

216
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,640
next i'll give you some examples on what

217
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,120
i used for resources

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
before i start with the resource slide i

219
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,959
just wanted to have a disclaimer that i

220
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,720
don't have any affiliation with any of

221
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,560
the recommended individuals or

222
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,200
organizations except for grim con those

223
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,040
are just examples or resources that i

224
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
use and i have found helpful

225
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
i know i mentioned twitter a lot of

226
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,640
cybersecurity on twitter but what is it

227
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,399
exactly you may wonder

228
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,480
so cybersecurity on twitter is not a

229
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,120
specific person or specific set of

230
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,880
people that you need to follow but it's

231
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,680
just

232
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,800
that

233
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,399
cyber security professionals are really

234
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,279
active

235
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,000
on twitter so you can follow anyone

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,880
who's you think it's in your expertise

237
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,200
and let's just by doing this by

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,519
following each other let's drop your

239
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,040
drop your twitter handle into the

240
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,959
discord chat and let's just follow each

241
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,640
other and um let's create this community

242
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
and um grimcon speakers are also really

243
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,440
good way to start following because

244
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
speakers we usually as speakers we

245
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,200
usually really like to give back to the

246
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,080
community and uh we're really um happy

247
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,959
and

248
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,240
into help helping each other um in in

249
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,120
this community

250
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,200
i really like um the tribe of hackers

251
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,080
series um for in terms of books

252
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,720
because the travel hacker series they

253
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,519
have three different books

254
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,320
security leaders red team and blue team

255
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
red team stands for the offensive side

256
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,640
of cyber security while blue team stands

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,839
for the defensive side of cyber security

258
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,560
this book has a collection of cyber

259
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,399
security professionals

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
recommendations advice in terms of if

261
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,800
you are new to cyber security what you

262
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,959
should be aware of so

263
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,839
just beginning with to begin with i read

264
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,600
that book and i found it tremendously

265
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
helpful for me

266
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
in terms of certifications

267
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,600
come to your security plus gives you a

268
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,760
really good foundation skills and

269
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,160
theoretical uh radical knowledge on

270
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,279
security

271
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,519
security that you need to know so it

272
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,839
kind of helped me pave the way and when

273
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,279
other people on twitter are talking

274
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,839
about oh this vulnerability is coming

275
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,839
from all kinds of they're using all

276
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,079
kinds of lingos and i can can kind of

277
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,240
sort of understand because of that

278
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,279
obtaining that certification

279
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,440
networking is also really important in

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
terms of cyber security and i recommend

281
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,800
cisco ccna um having a networking

282
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
foundation under your belt is

283
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,040
tremendously useful

284
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,240
podcasts i really enjoy listening to

285
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,760
document diaries

286
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
because and they go over like hacker

287
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
stories um in each series and i really

288
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
enjoy listening to them while i'm

289
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,079
driving

290
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,320
jack fransider is also really good um

291
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
storyteller

292
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,120
cyber outlier daily i listen to it to

293
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
get my influence that news of the day so

294
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,279
um just to

295
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,200
understanding more what's going on

296
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,680
what's happening in the secured security

297
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,560
world in the day

298
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,040
um and john hammond he does cyber

299
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,240
security ctf walkthroughs and i like

300
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
watching him when i'm stuck at a ctf

301
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,519
network chuck does

302
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,760
hands-on youtube videos hands-on

303
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,600
security videos

304
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,120
and black hill information security does

305
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,040
really good security educational videos

306
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,440
in terms of project to break it in

307
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,399
um i would recommend always do your

308
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,200
a home lab because you can't number one

309
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
you can practice it on your own in a

310
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,079
safe environment number two you can also

311
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,320
configure it on your own and becoming

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,800
your own syst admin get your experience

313
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,880
under the belt

314
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
for ctfs um there are three ctfs i

315
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,519
really enjoy playing

316
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,240
cyberstar pico ctf and national cyber

317
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,839
league those are really beginner

318
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
friendly ctfs um and there's our

319
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,600
gamified way of learning and

320
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,880
for pico ctf in particular um it's

321
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
established by it's developed by

322
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,200
carnegie mellon university and i will be

323
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
soon be um starting my master's in

324
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
carnegie mellon university so it'll be

325
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
really cool for me to look from a

326
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,760
developer perspective as opposed to a

327
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
player perspective

328
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,000
and for um blocks for my readers novi is

329
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
really good follow uh

330
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
novai does really cool

331
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
um

332
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,200
youtube videos and he writes a really

333
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,959
cool blog on

334
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,959
a set of instructions when what we

335
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,839
should

336
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,680
only what you can do

337
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,880
in terms of hacking too

338
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,240
so as a student i also got involved with

339
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,720
my school cyber security club which

340
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,560
introduced me to so many different

341
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
technical knowledge i learned about

342
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,360
networking so setting a home lab with

343
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,399
kali linux wi-fi hacking cryptography

344
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,600
web app pen testing password tracking i

345
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,199
also teamed up with other students who

346
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,240
are playing

347
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,560
to play regular jeopardy style ctfs and

348
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,040
social engineering competitions where we

349
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
were selected to compete internationally

350
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
and place top and osen open social

351
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
intelligence

352
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
we had guest speakers from hiring

353
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,240
companies to speak and hire us

354
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,120
i also helped building our community a w

355
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
of university chapter of women's cyber

356
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,360
security where we created the women's

357
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
cybersecurity group to be more like

358
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
community focused different from the

359
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,639
technical cyber security club

360
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
we had female guest speakers um and it

361
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,959
was really helpful for us to learn their

362
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,360
security journey and what their advice

363
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
is for a few future female cyber

364
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,160
security professionals

365
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,959
we also played ctfs together we hosted

366
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,440
coffee chats but mainly a sociable

367
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,600
aspect for students interested in cyber

368
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,800
security to get to know each other

369
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,040
now our women's cyber security group has

370
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,120
grown from three family members to more

371
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,800
than 30 students

372
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
and additionally for each university

373
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
there is usually its own stock and

374
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,800
hiring for

375
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,360
student workers stock stands for

376
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
security operations center and they're

377
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,040
really they're responsible for

378
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
monitoring and analyzing the

379
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,839
university's security posture and

380
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,680
incidents those positions normally don't

381
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,920
require any experiences and it's a good

382
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,599
way just to get your foot in the door

383
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,920
now conferences are my favorite

384
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,079
resources because the ability to make

385
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,320
one-on-one connections there are free

386
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,160
budget-friendly and more expensive

387
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,880
options some such as like local meetups

388
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,680
from hacker associations from where you

389
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
can meet local cyber security

390
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,319
professionals

391
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,839
some conferences are free and

392
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,320
educational such as grim con if you

393
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,399
enjoy those ones and want to try out

394
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,040
more options security b-sides are my

395
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,639
absolute favorite budget-friendly option

396
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,399
the first conference i would went to was

397
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
the local b-sides and was such a warm

398
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
community and everybody seemed to know

399
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,360
each other and welcomed newcomers when i

400
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,880
indicated that i was interested in

401
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,639
joining

402
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,639
if money is not an issue for you or if

403
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,160
you have the choice to go to a more

404
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
expensive conference i would definitely

405
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,839
recommend defcon rsa and black hat

406
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,519
defcon is one of the largest hacker

407
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,600
conventions in the world and coolest in

408
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,279
my opinion

409
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,160
i went to defcon 29 and it was an

410
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
absolute blast for me

411
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
they have villages such as biohacking

412
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,519
car hacking iot villages and where they

413
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,519
have workshops and labs that allows you

414
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,480
to hack into them legally my favorite

415
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,199
was the packet hacking village where the

416
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,199
famous wall sheep is

417
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,680
so defcon has this unwritten rule that

418
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,519
you want to secure your bluetooth and

419
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,759
wi-fi at a conference because otherwise

420
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,480
if you get hacked via those your name

421
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
and password will go on the wall of

422
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
sheep

423
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,320
yeah clear text and everybody will see

424
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,360
it

425
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
and also i wanted to share a good story

426
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,279
from defcon special shout out to elle so

427
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,079
i met out besides we kept in touch and

428
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,320
met up again at def con at the time i

429
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,120
went with my school to defcon we had

430
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,920
around 20 students when we met up again

431
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,320
she introduced it to us to even more

432
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,920
cyber security professionals in

433
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
different expertise

434
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
all the way ranging from network

435
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,919
security dfir

436
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,599
and threat intelligence to csos

437
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
and we started discussion group for us

438
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,919
students to ask them questions so it was

439
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,839
really cool for us because we started a

440
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,199
mini con in middle of the def con and we

441
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,199
attracted other conference participants

442
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,359
to join us slowly

443
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,760
in the end we had about 50 people in our

444
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
discussion group and we all enjoy the

445
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,000
session a lot el if you're still

446
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
watching thanks for the introduction

447
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,799
again

448
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,559
black hat unfortunately i have not been

449
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,000
that for myself

450
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,760
um but i've heard many good things about

451
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,160
it there are more uh there are more

452
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,880
expensive options and are more like

453
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,039
more like cyber security conferences for

454
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,679
the managers

455
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
next we're going to talk about how to

456
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,559
prepare for conferences usually for

457
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
conferences they will post a schedule

458
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,840
online several weeks in advance

459
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,000
they typically have several tracks

460
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
before i go to a conference i usually go

461
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,760
look up on the talks that i'm interested

462
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
in going to and mark them down in my

463
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
calendar on where the talk is when is

464
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,559
the talk and who is talking

465
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,960
when a conference is soon approaching i

466
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,799
connect with the speakers on twitter and

467
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,280
i usually say hey i saw you are talking

468
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
at this conference really look look

469
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,679
forward to hearing your talks

470
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,679
so this kind of helps me to leave a good

471
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,760
first impression with a speaker so when

472
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,200
i'm talking with

473
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,440
when i'm talking with them in person

474
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,400
later they already know who i am

475
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,559
and during the conference i usually just

476
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,880
go enjoy the conference experience

477
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,720
and talk with the people sitting next to

478
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
me to learn about more about what they

479
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,520
do

480
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,559
making friends in this field um because

481
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,480
cyber security is really small and the

482
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,919
friends that you make today may be your

483
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
co-workers the next day

484
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,679
i would also connect with them on

485
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,840
twitter linkedin see what their interest

486
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,799
areas are and find commonalities or ask

487
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,520
about them their areas of expertise

488
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,600
follow up with them see what conference

489
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,840
they're going to

490
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
now you have them in your network

491
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
another point i wanted to stress is to

492
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
leverage the brand that you have in

493
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,880
conference for more connections so for

494
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,440
me it was my university's name when i go

495
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
to a conference i wear my university

496
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,600
cyber security club officer polo because

497
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,679
it gives me authenticity and helps me

498
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,600
start with the conversations

499
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
when i went to defcon i had other

500
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
students recognize my polo and told me

501
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,799
that we played cctc together

502
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,039
and i also had recruiters coming up to

503
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,919
me because of that

504
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
after we finished step one and two it is

505
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,760
time for us to complete the last step

506
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,520
apply interview and land the job

507
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,840
applying is a game requires us to play

508
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,679
strategically

509
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,080
and i made a plan for myself when i

510
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,280
applied

511
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,600
i applied for 10 jobs a day

512
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,240
and in fact the more you apply the

513
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,480
higher chance you will get an interview

514
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,559
opportunity

515
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,360
but um as i applied to many jobs i kind

516
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,480
of got lost so i would go on google and

517
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
search and the same jobs i applied for

518
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,120
would show up again

519
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,919
so

520
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,600
i decided to make an excel sheet for

521
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
myself to keep track of the jobs i

522
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,960
applied for

523
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,600
contact i can follow up with whether i

524
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,679
heard back from them if i got an

525
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,640
interview

526
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,760
what's the interview state and time

527
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,240
it is now so much more efficient and

528
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
organized

529
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,559
i also wanted to emphasize on the

530
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,200
quality of applications

531
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
having connections in the community in

532
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,360
the company you apply for

533
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,039
allows us to get a higher chance of

534
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,880
getting an interview

535
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,280
that is why networking preparation is so

536
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,880
important

537
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,360
the next piece of advice i want to give

538
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,280
if you're a student is to not limit

539
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,440
yourself to your school's career

540
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,200
center connections

541
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
i used to only apply within my

542
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,520
universities network but i kept getting

543
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,159
rejections so i realized that i should

544
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,880
probably broaden my horizon and start

545
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
searching on google linkedin and even

546
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,159
twitter

547
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,480
that's how that's how i start to get

548
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
interview emails

549
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,559
the next one is for my ladies beat the

550
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,200
imposter syndrome

551
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
women don't really apply for the job

552
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,520
unless they fulfill the job requirements

553
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
a hundred percent while men apply when

554
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,159
they fulfill as 60

555
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,720
so i want to encourage my ladies to go

556
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,799
ahead and apply don't feel like you're

557
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,919
not qualified and don't let you reject

558
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,679
yourself

559
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,760
the last and most important one is to

560
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,080
stick to your plan and keep applying

561
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,360
until you find a job that you're

562
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,158
satisfied with

563
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
to prepare for interviews

564
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,320
it is more important for us to use it is

565
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,159
so important for us to use our osun

566
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,320
skills and on the company's culture

567
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,840
interviewer information if you have them

568
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,640
osun stands for open source intelligence

569
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,960
and overly getting prepared for the job

570
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,080
interview

571
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,039
and

572
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,280
never hurts this by

573
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,400
this means overly oh set your job

574
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,360
and you should also show your passion

575
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,919
from the ctfs that you played projects

576
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,080
that you've done relative experiences

577
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,159
that you have had whether if you had

578
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,880
worked experiences or not

579
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
a job can teach you the things that you

580
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,799
need to do but it can't teach you

581
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,760
passion

582
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,919
that's why hiring managers love to hire

583
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,600
passionate people

584
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,159
and to follow up i would also ask about

585
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,880
the timeline when you'll be hearing back

586
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,600
in how many interviews there will be so

587
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
that you can get an understanding of

588
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,720
when we should follow up

589
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,880
thank you notes this is to leave an

590
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,039
impression on the interviewer the

591
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,880
general rule of thumb is to send a thank

592
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,280
you note as soon as possible

593
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,720
but for holidays or fridays interviewers

594
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,320
are usually ready for the holidays or

595
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,600
the weekend

596
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,600
so sending a note on monday morning or

597
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,080
the next work work day would actually be

598
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,120
good

599
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,879
it is all about making an impression

600
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,520
the last lastly i just wanted to share

601
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
some additional resources

602
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
i don't have any affiliations with those

603
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,440
individuals but i found them super

604
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,760
helpful in terms of job hunting

605
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,640
um jason blanchard he does content and

606
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400

607

608
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,120

609
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,000

610
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,960

611

he teaches you how to do that

612
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,600
he also does twitch live stream on cyber

613
