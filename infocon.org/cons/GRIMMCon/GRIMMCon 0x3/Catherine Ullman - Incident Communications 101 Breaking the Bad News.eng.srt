1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,399
so

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,360
catherine welcome on that positive note

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,160
uh that's this is this is our 2020 uh

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,359
gloom and doom discussion woohoo

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,960
always good to have a little gloom and

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,480
doom well that's how we're going to

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,960
close that

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,720
year we're going to put it all into one

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
big ship pile we're going to set it on

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,519
fire

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,039
these recordings will still be available

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,400
afterward but we're going to we're going

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
to have a more positive 20 21.

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,200
i agreed absolutely but on that note

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
what's your prediction for

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
what you think is going to be a new

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,640
trend in 2021

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,680
on the threat side

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,600
i you know i i don't i don't truly

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,280
believe we're gonna see anything

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,840
new per se i mean everything old is new

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,559
again right

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,079
so even with what we've recently seen

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
um you know most recently with with

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,960
fireeye

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,960
and solarwinds um

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,519
certainly that was uh not a good thing

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,119
right that there was a whole lot of

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,280
um devastation to an awful lot of

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
companies and entities

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,040
but at the heart of what was done wasn't

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,439
super new i mean we've known that that

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,640
was a possibility

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
so i don't know that we're going to see

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,320
anything truly new

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,439
what i expect is we will see things that

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,640
are old

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,920
done in slightly different ways that

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,040
make them come across

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
new enough that the media decides to

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,479
jump on it and run with it

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,400
that's kind of that's my prediction

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,840
because that's kind of what we've seen

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,439
right when people talk about all of this

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,799
stuff

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
i and they say to me you know oh you've

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,399
been in security for you know for how

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,600
long and i don't know how you stay on

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,720
top of it all i'm like

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,320
because it the change is not

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,040
radical it's the same problems we've

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,119
been encountering for a very long time

53
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,119
and while it's cool because this stuff

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,560
does evolve to a certain degree and

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,119
there's always new stuff to learn

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
the the heart of the of what we've seen

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,119
has not changed

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,959
yeah that sophistication is not as

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,800
sophisticated as

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
it is portrayed no but i am grateful

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,599
that at least

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,599
when they use the word sophistication

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,360
with the solarwinds thing

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,000
you know and they used apt they were

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
actually not just talking about

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,239
a business email compromise so you know

67
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
yay for using the right word

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,840
um because i've certainly seen plenty of

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,400
that yeah

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,239
it's easy to attribute that

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,680
no i was just going to say it's easy to

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
attribute that uh

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,480
and kind of play off your negligence or

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,280
your breach

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,480
if you call it apt if it was

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,239
sophisticated you're not really liable

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,200
so it's no big deal

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,920
right like that kind of uh playoff blame

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,560
game

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000
i get from a liability standpoint a

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
business standpoint like as a

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,319
businessman like yeah i would love to

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,760
have someone to blame that

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,680
on but we really have to kind of start

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
to get away from that as

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
the professional industry that we are

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
we'll leave that to the cyber insurance

88
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,319
companies and let them

89
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,080
you know play off their liability

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,920
however they want but

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
yeah and i think i think one thing we

92
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
will start to see and we're already

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,599
seeing

94
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,040
right are those insurance companies

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,959
going hmm

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,120
no i'm not going to pay for this anymore

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
no we're going to change the contracts

98
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,159
when you get hit with this thing we

99
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,360
already know about

100
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,560
you're out of luck so

101
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,599
yeah yeah cyber insurance is going to be

102
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
a dangerous game to play and again we're

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
going to end up with more lawyers

104
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,159
because they're going to have to read

105
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,280
through all of that

106
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
fine print and we'll be doing some

107
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,879
circular

108
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,480
investing we'll call it

109
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,280
agreed i like how we brought in the

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,200
third rail of cyber insurance here

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
because that's its own

112
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,760
separate problem anyone got solution on

113
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,079
that one

114
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,360
and that ties into the ransomware issue

115
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,439
because ransomware has been

116
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,840
ravishing the the down market right i i

117
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,599
break the world into three categories we

118
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,560
have the haves

119
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
which we spend most of our time talking

120
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,080
about have problems

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,599
right when we're talking about like you

122
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,200
talk about uefi

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,639
i mean you're talking about the top of

124
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
the top you know littlest percentage

125
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
that can even consider a problem like

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,320
that let alone understand what it is

127
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,600
and then you have this other really

128
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,199
small group that's just below those

129
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,919
halves

130
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,000
and then everybody else is a have-not

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,280
and those have-nots are

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,280
municipalities local communities

133
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
water treatment plants small to

134
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,440
medium-sized businesses

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,960
and they're the ones that are getting

136
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,880
torched by ransomware and

137
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
my prediction from several years ago on

138
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,720
what was going to happen with ransomware

139
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,560
was i considered it the

140
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,120
collateral impact of connectivity which

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,360
was no one's going to target a community

142
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,840
bank

143
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
right there's nobody sitting there going

144
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
like well i really want to go hit peoria

145
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,000
because there's

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
so much money there but peoria happens

147
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
to use a lot of the same systems because

148
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,320
as much as we have all these different

149
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,360
vendors there's still

150
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
fundamentally a significant monoculture

151
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,759
and everything's connected right that's

152
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,360
what the internet does

153
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,320
and so what happens is you know insert

154
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,720
large financial bank can protect itself

155
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,080
and that ransomware that's going after

156
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
them just happens to sort of slide off

157
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,039
and knock that community bank offline

158
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,039
yeah i would agree i would absolutely

159
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,320
agree and i think too

160
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,800
i mean so i'm in higher ed and and

161
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,720
that's another space

162
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
um that has been hit pretty hard and

163
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,039
what we see with some of this stuff

164
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,880
it's really common that the attacker

165
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,320
puts puts something

166
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,000
out right through through email and

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
once it's downloaded and they get to the

168
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
next stage what they're doing at that

169
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
next stage is looking around and saying

170
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
hey where did i land is this an

171
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,840
interesting place should i keep going

172
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,039
so the target the true targeting nature

173
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,240
of some of this stuff is

174
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,400
is that it isn't it's just what can i

175
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,319
get into and when i get to that next

176
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,520
stage

177
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
look at that i'm in a thing and it's and

178
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
it might be cool and there might be

179
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
useful data here

180
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,360
so yeah that target of opportunity and

181
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
target landscape really you're

182
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,000
you're getting to the point where at the

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
end of the day

184
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,120
criminal enterprises even apt groups are

185
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
still business entities they still have

186
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,479
deadlines they still have timelines they

187
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,319
still have budgets they have

188
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,600
objectives and goals that they're trying

189
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
to meet and so while they're putting

190
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,960
time into the development

191
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,560
of you know whatever whatever it is

192
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,319
ransomware c2

193
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,000
that target of opportunity then has to

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,759
become monetized in order to

195
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,360
keep the lights on pay the bills maybe

196
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,800
they're contractors maybe they're

197
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
selling off access to apt groups so

198
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
that continual need to

199
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,199
provide money and sustainability at the

200
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,160
end of the day that we're all

201
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
capitalists even even the criminals are

202
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,759
capitalists

203
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,160
that capitalism has to pay for itself

204
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
and that is where we come down to

205
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
that target of opportunity or what can

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
we get for what we've done

207
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
i agreed which sets us up

208
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,039
really well for breaking the bad news uh

209
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,000
which is your talk

210
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,720
that it does

211
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,479
oh i got to make you presenter you do

212
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,240
i got carried i love it then i will

213
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,960
gladly share it

214
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,159
there you go boom all right

215
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,560
all right should be able to see it now i

216
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,319
hope

217
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,919
with our little grim fellow in the

218
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,240
corner

219
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,599
i liked the candy scythe i did too

220
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,440
i did too which is why i sort of crapped

221
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
him out of the other image because i

222
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,400
i couldn't cleanly get him otherwise

223
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,280
but uh yeah so we'll talk a little bit

224
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,680
here

225
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,479
about things like ransomware and

226
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,919
breaking the bad news in

227
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,360
the industry um because certainly

228
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
as we just discussed this is a huge

229
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
topic

230
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
so here we go this is this is the agenda

231
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,879
this is going to be a very short version

232
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
of a presentation

233
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,319
that i typically spend a little more

234
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,280
time on but i think we can really

235
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
hit the highlights and the really

236
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,479
important stuff and spend most of our

237
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,520
time there

238
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
so i'll talk briefly about myself and

239
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
why this is important if you haven't

240
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,479
already figured that out

241
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
and then we'll talk about some strengths

242
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,319
and weaknesses that we see within

243
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,360
infosec

244
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,639
that ultimately play a role

245
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,160
in in all of us being able to

246
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,919
communicate this information

247
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
and we'll talk about communicating at

248
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,839
different levels within our organization

249
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,279
and then we'll talk a little bit about

250
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,120
non-verbal communication which is

251
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,039
equally as important and some final

252
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,799
thoughts

253
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,279
so this is me well not really this is my

254
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,320
sloth mini

255
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,480
that i used to um was an adopted sloth

256
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,800
at the zoo locally she unfortunately

257
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
passed away a few years ago but

258
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,680
i love sloths this is really more about

259
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,320
me

260
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
um i've been with the university at

261
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,760
buffalo for more than 20 years

262
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,920
i'm on staff with some things i do a

263
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
bunch of volunteering and talks and i

264
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,560
have some degrees and some

265
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,920
certifications and other

266
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,920
assorted stuff so what's the motivation

267
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,720
behind this

268
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,440
well if you weren't just uh hearing us

269
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
talk a moment ago

270
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
ransomware and other forms of attacks

271
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,959
are pretty common

272
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,680
so you know the odds of getting hit with

273
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,000
something like that are pretty good

274
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,399
even when we've seen perhaps in some

275
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,560
cases a decrease in breach we've seen an

276
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,000
increase in records

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
so these are the statistics going

278
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,839
through september of this year

279
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,360
because that information is basically

280
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,440
quarterly so this

281
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
this shows you literally what the odds

282
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,600
are and you know if that really isn't

283
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,320
enough

284
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,800
realize that last year alone and of

285
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,000
course we're just coming the end of this

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,839
year so i can't wait to see what these

287
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,959
numbers show us

288
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,279
but last year we we lost roughly a

289
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,480
billion records

290
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,360
and a huge chunk of them they may have

291
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,920
you know

292
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,640
been not pii right they're not sensitive

293
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,600
data

294
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,360
but you could wind up with additional

295
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,800
exposure so this really

296
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
is something that you're likely to run

297
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
into and the reason why that

298
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,640
this talk came about is that i

299
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,720
recognized we seem to spend a lot of

300
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,079
time talking about

301
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,000
ideally how to prevent bad things from

302
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
happening and we talk about how to clean

303
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
up after bad things do happen but we

304
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,959
don't talk about

305
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,720
communicating while those bad things are

306
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,040
going on so that's really the focus here

307
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,320
today

308
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
and if you haven't seen this quote i'd

309
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,519
be very surprised

310
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,959
this idea that there's you know only a

311
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,640
couple of types of company

312
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,959
the ones that have been compromised in

313
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,399
some way and

314
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,839
you know the ones that are going to be

315
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,440
again right

316
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,560
if you don't know that you've been

317
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
compromised you probably haven't looked

318
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,519
hard enough

319
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,480
so sorry for the bad news but now let's

320
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,839
talk about this our strengths and

321
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,079
weaknesses

322
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,560
really this problem that we run into and

323
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,920
by this problem i mean sort of the

324
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,120
larger problem of

325
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
compromise and the possibility of

326
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
needing to do ir

327
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,360
is not a technology problem it really

328
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
isn't a lot of this is a people problem

329
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,240
and so if you

330
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,560
think it is maybe you should take a step

331
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,959
back and realize that all the technology

332
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,800
in the world can be incredibly helpful

333
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,240
and it has a role

334
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,279
but people play a huge role as well and

335
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,000
that's the

336
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,519
kind of the point of this particular

337
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,399
quote so what are we really good at in

338
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,680
security and

339
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,839
in i.t in general well we're great at

340
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,920
fixing things there's a problem we get

341
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
hyper focused and we want to solve the

342
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,040
problem right

343
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,959
so that's what we do and we are

344
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,880
spectacular at that that's what we are

345
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,399
known for

346
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,040
what we're not always good at and what

347
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,519
we're known for not doing well

348
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,800
is communicating with people so

349
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
whether or not you recognize this this

350
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,079
particular image is

351
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
from a skit on saturn in it live

352
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,000
where they have this computer guy who

353
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
you know kind of behaves like a jerk

354
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
and this is the attitude he gives right

355
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,480
it's the computer that's stupid not you

356
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,560
right and we do this and we don't

357
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
necessarily do it with

358
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,720
bad intention we're not trying to be

359
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,680
jerks

360
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,800
in most cases but the reality is that we

361
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,360
are

362
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,399
in some cases not so nice and it's

363
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,040
it's very easy to get caught up in

364
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,880
focusing on fixing the thing

365
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
and not the bigger picture with the

366
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
people

367
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,800
we don't have patience patience is tough

368
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
and and i've been there and i've been

369
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,399
in situations where you just want to

370
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,399
scream and tear your hair out right

371
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,760
because the person you're talking to

372
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,279
people they just don't get it or they're

373
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,440
not listening or they don't understand

374
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,079
but realize that that goes both ways

375
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,600
when you get frustrated

376
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
and you lose your patience you're not

377
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,880
patient with them either

378
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
and we'll talk about why that matters

379
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,720
why does it matter well

380
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
there can be a loss of trust and that's

381
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,839
really important if

382
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,560
your goal ultimately you know once once

383
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,839
you're done dealing with this

384
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,519
this incident or even during the

385
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,079
incident is for folks to trust you to do

386
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,240
the right kinds of things

387
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,160
you need to make sure that you're

388
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
communicating with them in a way that

389
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,040
that continues that level of trust

390
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,079
you're going to have difficulty

391
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,760
communicating with them in the future

392
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
you could have additional conflicts

393
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,120
there certainly could be negative impact

394
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
on the reputation of the company

395
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,800
people go out and they talk about things

396
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,560
they probably shouldn't you have a

397
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,440
decrease in

398
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,839
morale and everybody's stress level goes

399
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,920
up

400
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,399
so we're going to use an example here of

401
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
ransomware because it's so prevalent but

402
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
realistically everything i'm talking

403
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,680
about today

404
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
first of all it doesn't matter exactly

405
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,959
what role you are

406
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,160
so if you are you know the i.t person

407
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
and you do everything from security to

408
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,760
you know replacing keyboards or you are

409
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,800
one of

410
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,639
uh you know a small security team or a

411
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,920
large security team

412
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,560
this should apply to you when you run

413
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,320
into some situation that you're doing

414
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
some form of incident response

415
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,800
so the example i'm using here is

416
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,000
ransomware

417
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
so let's imagine that you've had

418
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,519
ransomware but it could be solarwinds it

419
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,959
could be any one of these

420
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,399
things that you know now you have to

421
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,079
deal with and

422
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,920
none of them are fun right none of us

423
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,839
want to go in and deal with this kind of

424
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,639
thing

425
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,160
so now what do we do well we can step

426
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,040
back and go

427
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,440
wow big explosion and walk away not

428
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,199
usually helpful

429
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,920
we can panic and completely freak out

430
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,800
also not terribly helpful

431
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,000
so instead we're going to have to

432
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
communicate something about what is

433
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,800
going on and again

434
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
depending on your role you're going to

435
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,680
communicate with different people at

436
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,800
different levels

437
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
so that's what we're going to spend most

438
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
of our time talking about

439
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,120
so we need to do what's called framing

440
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,959
the conversation and the whole idea

441
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
behind framing the conversation

442
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,880
is focusing on what's important to your

443
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
audience so these are the three levels

444
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
we're going to focus on your end user

445
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,800
your mid management and your executive

446
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,959
and you want to think in advance about

447
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,399
what are the kinds of things they might

448
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,240
ask and what is important to

449
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,519
them you also want to think about

450
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,360
how you're going to get this message to

451
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,519
them the channel right so

452
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,440
is the message going to be sent through

453
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,040
an internal website are you going to do

454
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
a presentation to somebody is this an

455
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
email or is it in person

456
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
there's always of course lawyer approved

457
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,240
pigeon carriers

458
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,560
but consider your channel because if you

459
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,399
have an entity that is potentially

460
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,079
inside your organization like

461
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,480
in the case of the solar winds maybe

462
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
internal email or communications of that

463
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,440
nature is not your best option

464
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,639
so first we'll talk about the end user

465
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,120
usually they're focused on what impact

466
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
it's going to have on their day-to-day

467
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,279
job right

468
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,199
you want to make sure that they know

469
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,639
what happened

470
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,160
and why but only what they really need

471
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,880
to know

472
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,040
if it's something where it's you know

473
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
somebody's clicked on something and you

474
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,320
have the opportunity to teach them

475
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
something about what happened

476
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,519
and encourage a change in behavior by

477
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,279
all means use that

478
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,360
ultimately we'll see all of these

479
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,639
different

480
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,320
groups whether it's end user mid

481
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,959
management or your executive

482
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,199
you need to use effective and efficient

483
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,079
communication

484
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,440
so what do i mean by that well

485
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,759
what i mean is number one be concise

486
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,880
less is more

487
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
absolutely you don't need to tell them a

488
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,000
huge story

489
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
you need to tell them something simple

490
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,279
but don't

491
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,600
use things like blaming management to

492
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,720
tell your story

493
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
and leave out stuff that's going to be

494
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,839
relevant to them that's why it's

495
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,440
important to focus on what is

496
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,079
important to them and be patient even if

497
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,440
you have to go in the closet

498
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
afterwards scream tear your hair out

499
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,040
it's important

500
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
make sure that whatever you are saying

501
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,120
without however you're communicating

502
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
that it's at a level where these folks

503
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,120
can understand and relate to it

504
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,839
because again there are ramifications if

505
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,519
you don't

506
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,360
this is how we don't want to communicate

507
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,560
with end users right we don't want to

508
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,680
scream at them

509
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,839
we don't want to freak them out we don't

510
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,440
want to give them you know additional

511
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,639
fear

512
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,240
that's not ideal so be upfront

513
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
lying to them you know the lies we tell

514
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
children right we tell them things to to

515
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,680
make it easier on ourselves

516
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
that often winds up biting us in the

517
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,600
butt and we don't want to deal with that

518
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
we want to address their fears so if

519
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,359
they're concerned about something you

520
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,599
know be honest about what you know and

521
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,280
what you can tell them

522
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,079
and perception really is reality in all

523
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,640
cases but especially for your end user

524
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,359
if they see or come across something

525
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,119
that they have a concern about even if

526
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,439
you

527
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,880
know it's really nothing make sure you

528
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,760
take a moment

529
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,280
and you listen to what they're saying

530
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,120
because number one it could be something

531
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,799
bigger than you realize

532
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,799
and number two they will really

533
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,880
appreciate that you took that time

534
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,840
to really listen to them all right our

535
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,919
mid-level managers right mid management

536
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,400
is a

537
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
really tough place to be everybody who's

538
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
in mid-management typically wants to go

539
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,120
up

540
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,960
right they want to be executives and the

541
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,480
people who are below them want to be in

542
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
mid management

543
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,480
that's a tough tough place to be they're

544
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,520
focused on

545
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,880
you know their impact to whatever

546
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,120
business process they're involved with

547
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,840
so

548
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
it's going to depend on their department

549
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,960
and again you want to speak to them at a

550
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,640
level that they understand

551
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
we're going to use effective and

552
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,840
efficient communication we're not going

553
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,679
to use technical terms with folks who

554
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,480
aren't in i.t

555
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,039
and even with those who are in i.t be

556
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,480
careful what terms you're using because

557
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,559
they may or may not understand them

558
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,880
there are groups of people in i.t who

559
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
might understand security terminology

560
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,440
that

561
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,840
other folks in iat don't so just be

562
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,120
aware of that

563
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,559
we don't want to be chickens with our

564
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,840
heads cut off right we don't want to

565
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,200
walk in there and be like oh no it's the

566
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
end of the world the sky is falling

567
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,520
we need to come to them with a plan

568
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,360
which we'll talk about in a second

569
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,799
so the ideal mid-level manager

570
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,320
what do they look like well they've got

571
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,480
fantastic delegation skills

572
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,640
their interpersonal skills are amazing

573
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,720
they can communicate they can negotiate

574
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,640
they have emotional intelligence

575
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,559
they're influencers and where are

576
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,960
these amazing people well i've given

577
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
this talk a few times and i've actually

578
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
had people come back to me and say oh

579
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,880
i have an amazing manager and that is

580
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,400
fantastic because

581
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,720
you know we should have more of them but

582
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,080
they are somewhat rare

583
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
kind of like pink fluffy unicorns

584
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,799
dancing on rainbows

585
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,080
so we're going to communicate with

586
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
regular middle management by being

587
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,720
supportive

588
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
again they're in that weird mid space

589
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,559
right so you're going to come with an

590
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,760
action plan

591
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,000
even if you're only presenting maybe a

592
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,760
portion of it because of your particular

593
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,600
job responsibilities

594
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
that action plan should include

595
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,360
communications that go up and down

596
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,000
so they're gonna you're gonna have to in

597
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,480
some

598
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,640
way either working with them directly or

599
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
yourself communicate

600
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
above them and below them and be

601
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,600
empathetic

602
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,320
put yourself in their shoes it is a

603
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,160
tough tough place to be

604
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,799
and whatever you do make them look good

605
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,760
it can only help you in the end

606
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
so the plan we're talking about this is

607
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,200
what it really should include

608
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
what happened all of your stakeholders

609
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,880
you should have a sense

610
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,720
of all of these different stakeholders

611
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,400
so you know are

612
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
are there just internal stakeholders

613
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
probably not they're probably external

614
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
as well in some capacity what are the

615
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,240
potential

616
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,000
recovery time frames what are our

617
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,440
options um

618
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,520
you know how can we make sure this

619
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,360
doesn't happen again or what what can we

620
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,400
do to

621
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,120
at least limit that possibility and have

622
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,200
an end goal in mind you know and maybe

623
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
maybe you have a plan and it's a

624
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,799
short-term plan and then you have

625
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,559
another short-term plan so the end goal

626
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,159
might not be

627
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,600
get to the end and clean up and be done

628
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,120
with everything the end goal might be

629
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,159
all right we need to get through the

630
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,840
next 24 hours and where do you want to

631
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,520
be in that next 24 hours or when do you

632
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
want to beat a certain point

633
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
be accountable management really needs

634
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,559
to take responsibility for their users

635
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,840
which doesn't mean

636
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,919
that we play the blame game it just

637
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:44,880
means if

638
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
you are dealing with folks you've made

639
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,080
mistakes or

640
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,679
have done something that have caused

641
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,000
problems you need to take responsibility

642
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,600
for that

643
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,200
so these are some things that you should

644
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,280
be thinking about in advance

645
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,120
that that you want to talk about with

646
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,880
these mid-level managers and you want to

647
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,159
have decisions made

648
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,080
well before this sort of thing happened

649
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,679
like how to handle

650
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,679
you know potential ransom payments so

651
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,440
don't be asking the question when the

652
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,120
rants when that happens

653
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,480
ask what are you gonna do before it

654
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,200
happens um you want to maybe

655
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,440
uh you know have that conversation with

656
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
legal

657
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
and anyone else that needs to be

658
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,360
involved you want to

659
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,919
coach and encourage collaboration so

660
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,280
where in this process are you going to

661
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,799
manage your delegate

662
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,559
are you going to delegate or negotiate

663
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,520
again important things to consider

664
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,440
all right so let's talk about our upper

665
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,039
tier our executives right

666
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,000
our executives look at the big picture

667
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,280
these are the things they're focused on

668
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,400
they're focused on our

669
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,159
the goal the reputation of the company

670
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,240
and the vision and performance you need

671
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,960
to think

672
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,640
30 seconds in an elevator so you walk

673
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
into the elevator that's all you have

674
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,600
time to tell

675
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,799
whatever you're going to tell them so

676
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,440
that means you have to do your homework

677
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,039
you need to understand who these people

678
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,960
are because remember we're framing

679
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,120
the questions we're framing this

680
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,880
whatever we're telling them

681
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,200
on them you want to enter and exit

682
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,720
gracefully don't be upset

683
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
don't as best you can you don't want to

684
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,000
be agitated

685
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,440
you're going to discuss things

686
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,520
strategically with them and remember

687
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
they're people too even if maybe they

688
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
don't seem like it because they're so

689
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,400
far removed from you

690
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,480
they really are most of them have you

691
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,000
know a home they go home to

692
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,280
family you know maybe grandkids it's

693
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,520
it's a it's not a an easy place to be

694
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,039
either

695
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,640
so usually this is kind of what they're

696
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,080
going to want to know they're going to

697
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,120
want to know what happened

698
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,400
and when it happened but in a

699
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,320
non-technical sense again think big

700
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,200
picture

701
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
best case worst case most likely

702
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
scenario and the consequences and

703
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,159
underlying cause

704
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,840
not you know mr smith click this email

705
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
and blah blah blah long story

706
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,360
they want to know a compromise occurred

707
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,720
which wound up essentially

708
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
making data unavailable right you don't

709
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,919
need to get into the nitty gritty

710
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
when you are speaking to executives do

711
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,760
not use geek speak and we've already

712
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,960
kind of covered this with

713
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,720
the other levels too right you don't

714
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,320
want to speak to them in a way that they

715
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,440
don't relate to

716
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,360
and geek speak for the most part is

717
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,679
going to be a no-no

718
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,159
so which executives well make sure that

719
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,440
all of these people

720
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,600
at least have an idea of what's going on

721
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,520
so the leaders of your finance your

722
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,960
operations your marketing your

723
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,080
technology folks

724
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,240
there may be others but at a minimum

725
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,000
make sure that these folks are aware of

726
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
what's going on

727
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,280
okay so we have given a message and your

728
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,240
and as you've seen

729
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
that message is not going to be the

730
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,679
exact same message for all these three

731
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,279
groups right but the question is

732
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,240
was the message received or did it sort

733
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,679
of fluff off and how do we know

734
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,120
well this is kind of where nonverbal

735
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,320
communications can come into play

736
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,640
if you're able to give this information

737
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,600
to them in person

738
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,720
pay close attention to body language

739
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,679
which includes these things so face your

740
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,240
posture

741
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,159
gestures handshakes breathing all kinds

742
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,159
of of things that have nothing to do

743
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,960
with the words coming out of your mouth

744
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
how you interpret those nonverbal cues

745
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,400
is critical so

746
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,919
think about when you see somebody with

747
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
raised eyebrows right

748
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
we can we can interpret that with

749
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,080
discomfort or maybe it's surprise or

750
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,039
maybe it's doubt

751
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,360
so any one of these cues looking at

752
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,640
somebody excessively

753
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,880
crossing your arms and legs right is it

754
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,159
cold in here

755
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,720
or are they resistant to ideas you can't

756
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,320
necessarily tell

757
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,440
same thing with exaggerated nodding so

758
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
what you have to do is synthesize them

759
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,400
any single particular cue might throw

760
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,520
you off

761
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,240
so read the person read the situation

762
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,919
look at all of these things this is just

763
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,600
one example right if you have raised

764
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,039
eyebrows with someone with where their

765
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,960
eyes are moving all over the place

766
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,679
their hard grip is on whatever it is

767
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,520
they're probably uncomfortable

768
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,080
um but you could see something else

769
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,520
again you need to sort of look at that

770
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,159
bigger picture

771
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,440
all right and i'm flying through this

772
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
our number one job i have always

773
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,159
believed in security is to educate

774
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,840
we want to educate we want people to

775
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,200
understand

776
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,039
why they should care about what we have

777
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,080
to say we don't want to adjudicate

778
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,440
learn what folks know and trade back

779
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,320
your knowledge with them for a while i

780
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,919
worked with a group

781
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,440
that were actually rocket scientists

782
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,640
and they were brilliant brilliant people

783
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,440
some of whom were really bad with pcs

784
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,600
that's just not what their focus was on

785
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,080
but

786
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,799
they were rocket scientists and so i

787
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,480
would teach them what they needed to

788
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,880
know

789
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,200
about their pcs and their and the

790
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
computing and the networking that they

791
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,919
had to do

792
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,559
in order for them to facilitate being

793
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,080
really good at

794
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,440
being rocket scientists right um which

795
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,720
meant using that computer as a tool so i

796
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,400
think it's really important to think

797
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,240
about what you can teach others and what

798
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,279
they can teach you

799
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,840
ultimately we want you to be the change

800
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,799
you wish to see

801
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,679
in the world right if you don't like

802
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,880
what you see

803
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,000
in terms of how it and security

804
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,039
are talking to people then be somebody

805
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,840
who doesn't talk that way and that's

806
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,880
certainly something

807
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,080
i came up through i t doing support and

808
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,679
system administration that was my

809
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,120
background before i started to do

810
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,880
security directly

811
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
and i have found that absolutely those

812
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,840
skills

813
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,679
empathy and the things any of the things

814
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,960
that i've learned in any customer

815
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,480
service role that i've had

816
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,000
have been invaluable for me in security

817
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,919
in part because i'm often doing some

818
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,520
translating uh of

819
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,159
it things to non-i t people or even to

820
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:52,559
i.t

821
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,919
people who don't necessarily grasp

822
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,159
some of the ins and outs of all of this

823
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,880
and now we should have plenty of time

824
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,720
for questions

825
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
i went a little faster through that than

826
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,159
i was

827
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,080
ultimately anticipating

828
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,159
yeah so uh first challenge is uh folks

829
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,080
are um only have access to

830
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,120
ask questions on discord discord yep

831
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,720
so now let's see what we've got going on

832
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,200
here

833
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,120
um posting for questions questions

834
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,320
for catherine

835
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,600
so um i i i really

836
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,880
there was a slide where you talked about

837
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,760
uh the responsibility of management and

838
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,039
as a former army officer

839
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,240
the thing that immediately went into my

840
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,840
head is like that's what leadership is

841
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
right like taking accountability

842
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,760
for your organization the people that

843
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,919
work there because i think all too often

844
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,880
we get into this blame the user culture

845
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,440
and to me i simplistically look at that

846
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,159
is

847
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,840
we're faulting them for using a computer

848
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,600
the way it was designed

849
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,880
yep agreed and yet we continue to do it

850
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,080
and we hear these anecdotal

851
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,480
stories of employees fired for failing

852
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,360
fishing tests

853
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,480
three times uh and

854
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,520
i see csos grab onto

855
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,679
phishing training metrics example of

856
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,720
progress

857
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,880
and they're like we went from 27 uh

858
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,559
people clicked to 22

859
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,880
people clicked and i'm like it's above

860
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,760
zero

861
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
wait going back to the bluetooth talk

862
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,960
any any access in

863
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,720
is it yes and it and it's backwards from

864
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
from the way that i think people should

865
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,159
think about those kinds of tests

866
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,679
too right so um i take a very strong

867
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,320
stance

868
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,760
on the subject of phishing when i

869
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,039
haven't when i have a department that

870
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,480
comes to me and says look we want to do

871
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,360
this

872
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,799
because we offer it but we don't

873
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,200
necessarily do it campus wide

874
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,360
i will explain to them the purpose of

875
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,240
this

876
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,039
is to get them better communicating uh

877
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,039
about what they're seeing

878
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,279
the purpose isn't to catch people like

879
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,039
that's not the goal

880
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,720
and i think that's really important so

881
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,480
even the language you use right so you

882
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,760
were just talking about

883
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,159
we went from you know 20 whatever 25

884
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
to 22 or whatever uh of people who

885
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,679
clicked

886
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,039
why are we not talking about the people

887
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,960
who didn't click and why aren't we

888
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,919
focusing on the message if we want to

889
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,600
change the behavior to a positive

890
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,960
behavior why are we focusing on the

891
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
negative message

892
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,520
additionally like the the people that do

893
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,000
click

894
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,240
and even if they are multiple clickers

895
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,279
those people are

896
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,600
some of your best assets for continual

897
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,480
training and training

898
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,159
the people around them not only at home

899
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,840
but in the work environment like hey

900
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
you should double check that email i got

901
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,559
caught doing this like that's going to

902
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,039
be a much better trainer from peers

903
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,720
additionally from a breach standpoint a

904
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,799
ciso that's went through a breach

905
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,080
or a team that's went through a breach

906
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,600
is one of your best assets that's

907
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
training and that's hands-on experience

908
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,159
that no one else can get or give so

909
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,679
those people are going to be much more

910
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,880
effective and efficient

911
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,000
have a much more uh broad understanding

912
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,840
of how to handle a breach properly and

913
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,039
the communication that's going to be

914
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,720
necessary from lessons learned

915
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,240
so you definitely don't want to fire

916
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,080
them you want to encourage that

917
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,559
yep absolutely because because if you

918
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,440
can get

919
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,320
somebody to to call out hey this is

920
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,760
weird looking

921
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,039
and then everybody else around them

922
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
hears hey this is weird looking hey

923
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,880
you should check you know hey don't

924
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,399
click on the thing you know hey this

925
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,919
thing just came

926
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,640
that is way more valuable than you know

927
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
well

928
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
so and so click the thing and now you

929
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,320
know we should punish them in some

930
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,159
capacity it should never ever be about

931
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,320
punishment it should be about

932
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,919
behavior change and moving in that

933
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,440
direction and

934
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,880
again negative behavior change um

935
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,559
is is only going to happen if you

936
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,480
continue to give a negative message

937
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:56,880
right

938
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,440
like that the two are are intimately

939
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,640
related

940
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,240
yeah that communication and really

941
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,679
understanding like us as security

942
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,039
practitioners and

943
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,640
infosec or even technical folks

944
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,399
we really have to understand and change

945
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,840
our mindset of

946
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,279
talking down to people bringing it down

947
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,440
to the level that's 100 percent not the

948
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,720
case we're not business people

949
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,360
our ability to speak at the level of

950
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,320
business speak

951
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,840
is limited to a certain capacity so

952
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,440
we're actually not speaking down to

953
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,559
someone and we have to change our

954
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,279
mindset

955
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,440
and say that we are taking it to their

956
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,360
language and really understand that

957
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,679
we're not above anybody and that

958
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,159
connotation of how we speak down to csos

959
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,600
or executives

960
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,440
really has to has to change otherwise

961
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,360
we'll never adapt we'll never get better

962
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,480
at speaking the business language

963
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,320
they'll never adapt and understand the

964
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,760
technical language that we're bringing

965
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,720
to them

966
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,559
until we're both treating each other as

967
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,760
equal and understanding

968
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
uh and trying to make that empathy jump

969
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,960
and make that understanding of

970
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,799
communication jump

971
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,240
yeah exactly and you know and and maybe

972
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,399
we need to understand a little bit more

973
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,000
about that the business language right i

974
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,519
mean that's something that i've had to

975
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,399
do over time

976
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,600
is is be able to speak in that way in

977
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,919
order to facilitate that communication

978
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,360
and what i think of in some ways is

979
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,760
translation and that's really what i

980
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,120
spend a lot of time doing

981
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
is in in the awareness role that i play

982
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,360
in my job

983
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,000
it really is just about saying here's

984
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,279
what you should understand

985
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,799
and here's a way for you to understand

986
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,279
it in language that makes sense to you

987
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,200
it doesn't need to have all the bells

988
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
and whistles and technical stuff

989
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,039
it needs to have the verbiage that you

990
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,519
can relate to and you can understand

991
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,120
and that that applies across the board

992
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,880
not only from communication but really

993
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,000
understanding the business and the

994
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,440
business functions and needs

995
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
the other day their business has to make

996
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,880
money and

997
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,720
allowing them to make business risk

998
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,320
decisions by appropriately

999
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,519
bringing them the information in the

1000
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,000
language they can understand is how you

1001
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,840
properly do your job that's your job as

1002
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,600
an analyst that's your job as a security

1003
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,120
practitioner is to bring it to their

1004
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,480
language so they can make an informed

1005
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,200
decision

1006
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,120
for their business and that's something

1007
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,360
that you have to learn to apply from not

1008
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,799
only a vertical standpoint

1009
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,240
uh you have to be able to talk in that

1010
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,159
industry or in that particular sect and

1011
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,519
at that level

1012
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,960
but you have to understand their

1013
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,399
business otherwise you're not going to

1014
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,000
be able to provide them the information

1015
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,480
in

1016
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,039
in the means that is going to be

1017
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,039
worthwhile

1018
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,080
exactly i mean i can give a a formal

1019
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,519
example of that

1020
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,080
we um i i've had a couple of tickets

1021
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,880
recently where

1022
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,679
entities wanted to share data outside of

1023
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,960
the university

1024
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,399
which is fine like we do this all the

1025
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,799
time but it was it was the type of data

1026
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,960
where we have to be very careful on how

1027
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,000
we set this up so instead of you know

1028
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
either calling them up and saying no

1029
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,919
which is what some people will simply do

1030
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,159
um or calling up and saying well you

1031
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,600
have to do it this way

1032
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,120
the first thing i did was call them up

1033
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,960
and say what's the goal

1034
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,559
what are you trying to accomplish tell

1035
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,640
me about the process

1036
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
that that's involved here i want to

1037
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
understand what you're trying to do

1038
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,279
and then let's work together to figure

1039
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,159
out how we

1040
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,399
can most safely accomplish that and at

1041
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,519
the end of the day

1042
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,880
that's what we're doing we are educating

1043
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,320
it's called being a good human being

1044
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,000
right learning that empathy learning to

1045
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,599
understand and communicate

1046
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,280
at the end of the day we all just be a

1047
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,639
little bit more compassionate a little

1048
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,760
more empathetic

1049
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,480
and really start to adapt ourselves and

1050
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,280
be the best

1051
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,639
us that brings a whole 100 percent to

1052
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,918
the table where you can have multiple

1053
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,119
hundred percent brought you're going to

1054
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,399
have a much better

1055
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,280
outcome long term in any business

1056
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,480
absolutely

1057
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,918
i would agree we do have some questions

1058
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,960
first one up what training or courses do

1059
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,560
you point cyber security people to help

1060
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,480
them with communication and dealing with

1061
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,719
management

1062
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,960
that's a really good question um i can

1063
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,719
tell you that

1064
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,399
there are a couple of people that i

1065
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,800
would look at um

1066
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,119
but i don't know that i have particular

1067
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,599
course stuff yet i can tell you that i'm

1068
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,359
working on something myself

1069
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,960
uh that once once it is formally out

1070
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,720
there i will i will formally announce

1071
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,560
but i i'll give the hint that something

1072
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,760
is coming

1073
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,359
um but uh it

1074
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,960
they're really this is a tough tough

1075
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,920
area there are certainly

1076
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,839
there's certainly stuff out there for

1077
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,079
communication like within businesses

1078
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,400
and i think it's applicable but i think

1079
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,240
it does take a little more hoop jumping

1080
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,320
maybe to see the applicability

1081
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,640
so unfortunately i don't have like

1082
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,000
specific things i can

1083
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,560
i can point people to at this time but

1084
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,000
there's something coming

1085
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
there's there's a ton of books out there

1086
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,200
really any of the books on on

1087
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,160
understanding business

1088
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
business leadership i mean look at some

1089
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
of jocko's books on the dichotomy of

1090
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,280
leadership

1091
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,760
uh any any of his stuff is is fantastic

1092
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,200
of really understanding how teams and

1093
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,599
dynamics work how to take responsibility

1094
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,280
those all apply to the infosec and being

1095
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,880
able to bring that

1096
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,040
that kind of uh forward thinking and

1097
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,079
forward leadership

1098
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,000
to the table when you're talking with a

1099
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
business or an executive i think that's

1100
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,760
a great starting point

1101
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,560
yeah i'd agree

1102
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,400
okay what do people need to tabletop

1103
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,040
first to help non-technical folks learn

1104
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,800
about what to improve

1105
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
i think with a tabletop it's having

1106
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
those non-technical people at the table

1107
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,920
like that's what we often don't do right

1108
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,240
we we involve our technical people maybe

1109
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,480
in our leadership but we don't involve

1110
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,079
those folks um so i think it's

1111
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,599
you know maybe take a scenario that's

1112
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,520
already happened in your organization or

1113
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,320
one that you see

1114
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,800
frequently happening and take a step

1115
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,480
back from the super high technical stuff

1116
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,440
and think about how you want the

1117
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,280
non-technical folks to respond to that

1118
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
like what do you want them to do

1119
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,359
and play that out with them get them

1120
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,480
involved have

1121
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,480
you know have have a scenario bring

1122
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,079
one person from five different

1123
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,839
departments who's not technical to the

1124
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,839
table for the scenario

1125
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,079
and see what they think like get their

1126
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,440
feedback

1127
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,119
see you know see what they would

1128
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,040
normally do because

1129
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,680
if what they normally would do is useful

1130
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,240
and

1131
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,440
um could contribute fantastic

1132
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,240
if it's either a combination of things

1133
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,680
you don't want them to do or just a

1134
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,960
bunch of things you don't want them to

1135
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,760
do

1136
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,320
then obviously that's that's not ideal

1137
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,400
and you want to spend some time

1138
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
working within maybe within that

1139
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,079
scenario to guide them in a direction

1140
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,599
that you want them to go

1141
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,359
so always being able to encourage

1142
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,119
positive behavior in that way

1143
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,839
is is can be useful

1144
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,760
on that one so fast because i looked at

1145
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,280
that i was like oh man i feel like i'm

1146
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,560
setting her up because that's a that's a

1147
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,000
tough question

1148
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,760
it is a tough question but i i think

1149
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,839
it's an area that um

1150
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,359
you know we're just starting to do

1151
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,800
insecurity ourselves right we're just

1152
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,240
starting to really get serious about

1153
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,440
tabletops

1154
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,720
um you know the back doors and breaches

1155
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,480
the stuff that that black hills has come

1156
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,160
out with bryson you've done

1157
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,599
you've done these uh choose your own

1158
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,520
adventure scenarios right so all of

1159
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,200
those kinds of things

1160
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,000
are relatively recent um even though

1161
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,040
table topping

1162
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,560
in a general sense has been around a

1163
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,720
really long time i've been in the fire

1164
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,760
service for

1165
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
you know a zillion years what it seems

1166
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,240
like and and we have

1167
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,640
they literally have table tops with

1168
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,880
little cars and things where you can you

1169
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,240
can do a scenario

1170
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,400
like uh you have a chlorine spill and

1171
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,760
the wind is blowing this way and what do

1172
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,400
you do

1173
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,240
right so that concept has been there a

1174
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,599
really long time

1175
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,400
um but we're kind of just getting used

1176
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,880
to that

1177
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,200
and because of that we're only i think

1178
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,560
thinking about it

1179
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,760
in our security bubble uh at that

1180
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,800
top level and because it's so new but

1181
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
that really is kind of the next step

1182
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,160
is you know legal should be involved you

1183
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
should have a couple of end users about

1184
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,359
you really should have

1185
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,040
ultimately have somebody from all these

1186
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
different levels play the game with you

1187
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,320
because in real life

1188
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,200
they will so if if if you get a better

1189
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,040
handle on what they're doing

1190
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,119
everybody's better off and and people

1191
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,960
like doing stuff like this

1192
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,000
i mean my experience is it's a game for

1193
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,560
them

1194
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
even if even if it really is mimicking

1195
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
like something bad that's happened in

1196
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,520
the org already like

1197
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,960
it gives them a chance to kind of think

1198
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,280
about it not under that pressure

1199
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,440
and eventually it's going to happen

1200
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,400
again

1201
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,000
yeah it also gives them a chance to kind

1202
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,839
of shine and show areas

1203
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,920
of creativity that they may not even be

1204
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,760
related to their job function i mean

1205
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,520
really getting people involved getting

1206
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
the conversation open and then

1207
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,359
bringing people and processes into the

1208
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,960
whole thing yes there's a technology

1209
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
aspect yes there's the

1210
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,400
mitigations and and reaction but the

1211
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,280
the processes and the people involved

1212
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,880
and being able to provide some of that

1213
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,640
benefit of walking through that

1214
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,320
that's when you start to see huge

1215
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
organizational changes that can

1216
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,240
shift cultures and actually make a big

1217
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,440
difference

1218
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,079
agreed that's why i like the the bruce

1219
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,760
schneier quote up front about

1220
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,280
the the role in technology or

1221
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,599
the over-reliance or confidence that we

1222
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,480
have in it

1223
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,400
and as a result shows how little we

1224
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,760
actually understand it

1225
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
um the the major criticism that i've

1226
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,480
come up with for this industry is

1227
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,560
we have a lot of nerds coming up with

1228
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,880
nerd solutions to nerd problems

1229
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,240
yep yep exactly and

1230
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,720
that's just the technical component

1231
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,359
which is

1232
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,680
a fraction of the problem the surface

1233
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
area and these things

1234
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,200
and we see this manifest in so many

1235
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,720
different ways

1236
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,640
in the offensive side of the house i

1237
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
think we are all too fond

1238
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,079
of uh being very clever

1239
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,000
i think we this is where i've been

1240
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,760
giving my talk for a couple of years now

1241
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,720
on how that's

1242
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,000
conflated with ego uh starting to drive

1243
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,880
it versus

1244
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,000
still fitting with what the

1245
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,480
organizational requirements are

1246
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,440
um and and we're doing ourselves a

1247
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,160
disservice

1248
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,960
and we continue to complain that users

1249
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,000
or management

1250
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,599
or folks that are not directly within

1251
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,200
what we do don't

1252
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,160
understand what we're doing but it's

1253
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,839
incumbent on us

1254
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,240
to speak their language and talk to them

1255
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,920
and that's why i love the table tops

1256
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,800
that's why

1257
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,119
i really liked um inspired by tim

1258
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,319
malcolm vetter the choose your own

1259
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,000
adventure that i pulled together

1260
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,599
um and so many other folks that are

1261
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,040
doing so many things and i'll also give

1262
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,560
a credit out to uh

1263
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,200
bruce potter uh for his work with his oh

1264
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,760
noes

1265
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,119
uh dungeons dragon style yeah game

1266
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,400
um because those are

1267
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
how we facilitate that conversation

1268
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,000
because the end of the day it really

1269
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,800
isn't about

1270
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,560
the technical depth of it you don't need

1271
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,800
to go down to ring zero to have a

1272
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,079
conversation over

1273
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,680
what would happen with a ring zero

1274
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,520
attack on your enterprise

1275
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,960
right right i don't even have to know

1276
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,560
what ring zero is to be able to have

1277
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,680
that conversation

1278
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,000
and having a meaningful contribution and

1279
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,720
buy-in

1280
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,319
to what your organization is doing to

1281
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,760
protect me

1282
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,440
yep and there's so much in the news

1283
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,960
right now too right like

1284
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,680
people there was a time when when a lot

1285
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,760
of what we did was totally hidden nobody

1286
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,000
knew about any of this stuff because

1287
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,520
you know the whole computing thing was

1288
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,240
like under the table somehow

1289
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,359
and now it's mainstream media i mean

1290
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,599
for good or for ill right it's out there

1291
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,599
so people have heard the words

1292
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,119
and they've heard the way the media uses

1293
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,440
them but they don't necessarily

1294
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,599
use the you know they don't understand

1295
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,200
the lingo necessarily right they

1296
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,880
understand the media's interpretation of

1297
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,520
it

1298
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,440
um so i think that that plays a role too

1299
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,280
and that really is our job is to take

1300
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,000
what is technical and provide it in a

1301
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,520
means that is actually

1302
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,760
valuable to the business and i think we

1303
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,400
need to be the buffer between the media

1304
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,000
and a lot of our executives because that

1305
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,680
is you know that is where they're having

1306
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,119
to get their source and why are they

1307
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,560
having to get that source

1308
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,480
uh we should be as technology

1309
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,319
professionals providing that

1310
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,040
kind of buffer and translation for them

1311
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,800
so that they can make a better informed

1312
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,880
decision that's not coming from a mass

1313
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,839
media or

1314
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,319
you know misinformation disinformation

1315
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,839
whatever you're going to call it

1316
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,720
that's happening agreed absolutely

1317
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,119
oh we can't hear you bryson

1318
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,839
there you are here we go 2020 right like

1319
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,760
the the virtual world

1320
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,599
you got two different mute buttons your

1321
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,880
microphone doesn't know which

1322
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,920
is talking to what and yes can you hear

1323
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,119
me now yes thank you

1324
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,280
so uh catherine so great to see you

1325
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,640
again and thank you so much for this

1326
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,119
insight

1327
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,800
i thought it was a really important

1328
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,400
addition to the speaker track because i

1329
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,359
think we do not

1330
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,839
pay enough attention to the human side

1331
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,599
of these problems

1332
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,359
well i really appreciate being able to

1333
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,520
be here and talk about this subject it's

1334
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
something i could talk about all day

1335
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,680
i will be on discord so for any

1336
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,280
questions that didn't get answered i'm

1337
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,240
happy to jump in

1338
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,680
and spend some time there

1339
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,118
nice happy grim cod thank you thanks
