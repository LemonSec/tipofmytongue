all right so

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
nothing to do with warfare we're gonna

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,320
go urban exploring now

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,840
yeah we're gonna go

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,200

3 on this frosty pandemic ridden

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,440

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,879
talk to you today about

14
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,120
urban exploration the hobby that i feel

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,320
like has been

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
lost over the years especially since uh

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,079
you know 9 11 happened and trespassing

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,000
was really cracked down upon

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,320
back in those days and i'm trying to

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
bring it back trying to create a

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,799
resurgence here

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,680
a renewed interest in this if you will

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,799
and

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,320
i'm going to do it by talking at you

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,720
about the things that are involved uh

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,880
first off here's me i'm johnny christmas

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,759
i've done a ton of stuff i am the 3d

28
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
printed tsa keys guy in case you were

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,960
like who's that guy why do i know that

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,720
name it's probably that

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
i've also done a bunch of other crap

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,920
over there i don't know

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,680
uh only vaguely related to urban

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,600
exploration maybe like the middle

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,159
bunch there that's it um nobody really

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,640
cares

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,439
we're not gonna linger on this let's get

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,159
into

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,880
the rules the kind of like unspoken

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,479
guidelines the framework

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,159
that you just kind of should keep at the

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,520
forefront of your mind

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
when you're thinking about getting into

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,360
urban exploration

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,360
uh as a hobby first off

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,799
um i'm not a lawyer it makes for this

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
uh amazingly problematic acronym

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
but uh i digress

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
um you probably all may have guessed

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,878
that

51
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,920
urban exploration involves a whole heck

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,640
of a lot

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,879
of trespassing uh it's true

54
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,080
trespassing primarily is the main legal

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,560
issue

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
that you bump up against when you're

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
thinking of doing this sort of thing as

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,120
a hobby

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,520
you've got both that criminal and civil

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,040
liability

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
potential depending on local

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
jurisdiction

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
local laws and what those laws look like

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
and what the punishments look like are

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,080
going to vary by municipality

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,640
um right down you know to from town to

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,280
town

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,200
that can even vary and i've seen it

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,280
range from you know a 200

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
fine to three years in prison um

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,920
so uh make sure you're aware

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,480
of what kind of trouble you can be

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,599
getting yourself into

74
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,440
before you start uh going down this path

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
because it can really suck when you get

76
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,879
hit with a ten thousand dollar fine

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,319
because you got busted doing something

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,120
stupid

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,319
uh and you didn't even know that it was

80
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,400
a possibility upside

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,280
is generally these punishments aren't

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,080
enforced

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,480
um generally you're gonna be breaking

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
into and yes you're breaking into

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,080
uh private property that

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
is not currently cared about it

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,519
other you know if it was cared about it

88
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,519
wouldn't be particularly interesting

89
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
with some cool exceptions but no time to

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,840
get into those for now

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
the main concern that owners of this

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,040
property have is that somebody's going

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,760
to go

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
going to go inside there and get injured

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,000
one of the things that causes that is a

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,480
lot of

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
optics a lot of visibility to perhaps

98
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
how cool this place is and the fact that

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
it's abandoned

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,440
thus causing more people to start coming

101
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
in and the more people you have coming

102
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,239
in the more

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,680
potential there is for someone to get

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
injured or killed and then you as the

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,560
property owner

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,879
are often at least partially responsible

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
for what goes on there

108
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,640
uh and so that's that's why those laws

109
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,959
are in place for the most part

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
um usually like the laws are uh

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
uh meant to really be enforced in the

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,280
cases of

113
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
uh trespassing and actively used uh

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,798
facilities

115
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,639
not so much abandoned ones but those

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,880
those trespassing laws can be used

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
against you for that as well uh because

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,720
they're better than the nothing else

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
that there is for that

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,960
um also you've got the potential for you

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,320
know the damage you're causing to the

122
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,759
property including damage you might

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,759
cause just simply entering

124
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,800
uh or walking around um

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,479
you may go this is abandoned look this

126
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,000
place is a wreck if we look at the video

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,400
i have

128
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,560
playing behind me like who what kind of

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
who cares if this place gets damaged

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,960
again if they're trying to use existing

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,479
laws to get people to stop

132
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,479
going into these places that's one of

133
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,240
the things that they can certainly hit

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
you with

135
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
because you have in fact possibly

136
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,400
damaged

137
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
someone's private property and there you

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,600
go

139
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
you've also got injury or death of

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
someone you're traveling with

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
if somebody gets seriously injured or

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,360
perhaps killed you know their family

143
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
might come after you saying hey

144
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,639
you lured our son you lured our father

145
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,680
whatever into this uh precarious

146
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
situation without properly informing him

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,800
of the risks

148
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,479
this is your fault we feel you're

149
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,240
responsible now uh for his death so

150
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
again that's something a lot of people

151
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,280
don't think about is you know what

152
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,320
happened you know the people you're

153
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,120
traveling with

154
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,400
what happens if something happens to

155
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,720
them is it your fault it could be

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,479
keep that in mind um back to

157
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,560
uh the trespassing aspects a little bit

158
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,680
and just generally

159
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,199
avoiding causing problems for yourself

160
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,560
and others uh don't be suspicious uh and

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,919
don't be obnoxious

162
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
i think both of those are really key

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
things to keep in mind

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,800
both while attempting to stake out a

165
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,440
place

166
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,160
attempting to enter a place and of

167
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,880
course

168
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,120
while you're in the place don't make so

169
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,800
much noise that you can be heard from

170
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,080
the outside of it

171
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,199
and of course when you know when you're

172
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,440
leaving as well um

173
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
when you're snooping around trying to

174
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,680
find how to enter this building whatever

175
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,039
it might be

176
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,360
don't look like that's what you're doing

177
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,199
don't look like a burglar is a basic

178
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,880
easy thing to keep in mind keep all your

179
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,560
crap in your bag

180
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,600
um don't take it out to your inside make

181
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
sure you pack it all up before

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,919
you go back outside don't park directly

183
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,880
in front of

184
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,240
the building you're about to go into

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,479
especially you know if it's abandoned

186
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,919
you might you're probably the only car

187
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,440
there you're probably the only car

188
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,680
that's been there for a very long time

189
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,759
and so just the car being there is going

190
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
to tip people off that someone's inside

191
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,160
that might tip the cops off who might be

192
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,919
having a slow news day and might want to

193
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,960
do something about it

194
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,520
and finally as you're exiting as it says

195
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,880
here

196
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
don't don't linger heck even as you're

197
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
just looking around for how to get in

198
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
you might be coming back tomorrow you're

199
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,319
just casing the joint for today don't

200
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,479
don't hang around once you're done get

201
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,240
the hell out of there the longer you're

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,039
visible

203
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,199
the more you're amplifying the potential

204
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
for causing trouble for yourself

205
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,000
so get in get out go home

206
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,360
um before you enter and probably before

207
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,199
you even begin casing out the joint

208
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,080
um do some research this is really the

209
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,520
best place to get started

210
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,919
this is the best way to find a place to

211
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,160
go to in the first place

212
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,680
look around you know especially if you

213
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
live in say

214
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,919
parts of the country that have been

215
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,120
once had a really big economic boom

216
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,599
and then crashed later those are the

217
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,199
places that often have

218
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
uh the uh most

219
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,440
waste the most buildings that have been

220
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
huge and reused for

221
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,840
tons of cool things or one cool thing

222
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,960
production

223
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,919
uh storage something and now have been

224
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,440
abandoned forever because

225
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,919
that industry has gone and no one's

226
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,520
worked in that town in a million years

227
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,800
you know something like that something

228
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,199
like the rust belt you know

229
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,560
some somewhere where you know an

230
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,800
american industry has come and gone

231
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,319
um places where they're you know there

232
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,479
used to be the old silicon valleys are

233
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,319
often great places to go look

234
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,319
um rochester new york comes to mind

235
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,319
which has a you know the

236
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,560
uh they used to have a subway system

237
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,400
that's now closed down you can explore

238
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,319
out there like how cool is that

239
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,199
so look for uh research the places

240
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
you're going to

241
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,958
look for old historical information like

242
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,559
that and when you find a building that's

243
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,240
still standing that's abandoned look for

244
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,719
historical information on it

245
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,760
um that's going to tell you a lot about

246
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
is it you know was was it on fire

247
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
recently you know has there been some

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,680
horribly destructive thing that's gone

249
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,200
on to the point where you probably

250
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,160
shouldn't even be going inside at all

251
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,920
even just looking this information up

252
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,680
often will lead you to

253
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,160
information about how to go exploring

254
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,440
inside of there

255
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
often perhaps just because you'll

256
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
stumble across like a flickr account or

257
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,399
some youtube videos to somebody

258
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,600
or something of somebody else who's

259
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,839
already done this and

260
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,519
it often takes quite a few of those

261
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,880
before you can piece together how to

262
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
actually enter

263
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,839
sometimes those methods of entry no

264
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,519
longer exist you might have to find

265
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,839
others

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,160
satellite images are really good for

267
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,000
that at least for looking around the

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,360
outside

269
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,040
nothing is going to be of course you

270
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
know in person recon

271
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
walking around the outside of the

272
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,240
building and looking but

273
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,680
perhaps it's a building that's a pain in

274
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,760
the ass to get to

275
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
perhaps walking around is difficult or

276
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,040
suspicious you know you might have to

277
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,720
cross two or three perimeters before you

278
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,760
can get inside

279
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,720
i did a an abandoned children's hospital

280
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
just outside of berlin that had two

281
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,399
fences around the outside he had to get

282
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,800
through before you're even on the land

283
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,120
and could walk towards the hospital so

284
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,080
it's good to do the research up front

285
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
and i think finally what i would put the

286
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
urbex groups

287
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
last because those are often the least

288
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,880
productive urbex folks for the reasons i

289
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,240
just stated

290
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,959
aren't extremely open to sharing

291
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,560
information about

292
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
all of this it attracts other people to

293
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
the spaces which causes

294
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
security to greatly increase around the

295
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,519
area either privately or you know

296
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,000
police wise or something and urbex folks

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,279
just don't want that

298
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,640
also it's illegal it's against the law

299
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
and so they don't want to share the fact

300
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,839
that they're breaking the law with

301
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,880
someone they don't know

302
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,600
but if you do a lot of good work you

303
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,040
post a lot of good footage you're

304
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,000
helpful

305
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,279
that's how you make friends in any

306
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,120
industry and more people are going to

307
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
eventually trust you and be willing to

308
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
help you out

309
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,959
once you're inside or thinking about

310
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,079
going inside at least

311
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,640
uh like you found a place know your

312
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,760
physical limits

313
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,000
this is super important we're talking

314
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,800
about

315
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,040
um your life here we're talking about

316
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
life and

317
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,440
risk to serious industry uh uh injuries

318
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,079
sorry

319
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,360
um and and you gotta really sit down

320
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
and accept some things about yourself

321
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,040
um i put a few things here that are just

322
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,440
good

323
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
key elements to have when doing these

324
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,200
things they may seem a little excessive

325
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,640
even to some of you

326
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
i assure you they're not i try to be as

327
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
lenient as possible by using real data

328
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
that i have for my own dives

329
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,360
um like walking five plus miles really

330
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,200
you're just you're going into a building

331
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,560
yeah i log five miles

332
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
easy when exploring a building because

333
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
you're walking constantly especially in

334
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
circles and you're covering every area

335
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
back and forth you can get five miles in

336
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,360
there

337
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,480
real easy um five miles also not as hard

338
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,440
as it sounds but

339
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,680
maybe try it out somewhere safe before

340
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,120
you go in for real

341
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
um the lifting and carrying 70 pounds

342
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
you're gonna have to move heavy things

343
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,399
out of the way

344
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,079
you're gonna have to pull doors open

345
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,600
you're gonna have to pull

346
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
yourself up onto ledges make sure you

347
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
can do that make sure you can do that a

348
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,360
few times

349
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,959
you know just three pull-ups three

350
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,959
pull-ups is hard for a lot of people

351
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,399
i've been into phases in my life

352
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
constantly where i could no longer do

353
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,000
even three pull-ups it's not

354
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,240
embarrassing uh it's just a thing you

355
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,600
need to be aware of

356
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
um be aware of how much you weigh

357
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,639
versus how beat up the structure is and

358
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,560
that's not to say like uh you know

359
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
are you too fat to go walking around in

360
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,720
abandoned building it's

361
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,240
is your 200 pounds too much for

362
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,320
the intense structural damage this place

363
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,279
may have suffered

364
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,440
and that's gonna uh apply as you walk

365
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,560
through the place as well

366
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
i usually make sure i have a rod or a

367
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,440
pole or a stick or something that i

368
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,040
could just constantly whack the floor

369
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,320
with in front of me as we're coming

370
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,120
through dangerous areas just to be sure

371
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,399
when i talk to other urban explorers the

372
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,040
topic quickly comes up of oh i had a

373
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
friend or we lost someone

374
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,959
who you know so and so two years ago

375
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,839
everyone knows somebody it's like

376
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,440
motorcyclists everybody knows somebody

377
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,800
or has a story about somebody who died

378
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,920
on a motorcycle

379
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
um every urban explorer has a story

380
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
about somebody who died doing urban

381
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,399
exploration

382
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,120
and almost always it's because they fell

383
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,160
through the floor

384
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,839
sometimes the floor is a roof they were

385
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,120
on but they fell through the floor

386
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,839
because

387
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,720
they weighed too much for the for the uh

388
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
structural

389
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,480
capacity of that of that flooring and

390
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
it's not that they were fat

391
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,959
it's that they were more than that floor

392
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,079
could handle and it's something you

393
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,200
really got to keep in mind

394
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,360
especially if you are on the heavier

395
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,720
side the heavier you are the more you

396
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,320
really have to consider this

397
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,680
um and my favorite thing here finally uh

398
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
bring snacks and take breaks holy crap

399
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
does this help

400
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,959
i i cannot tell you how uh how

401
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,360
big of a deal it is to just like stop

402
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,920
take five minutes take ten minutes

403
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,240
eat a granola bar eat a banana just keep

404
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
it in your bag

405
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,880
it really gives you a great boost where

406
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,240
you can get up and you can keep going

407
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,880
and you get

408
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,560
more energy because you don't want to

409
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
have to come back you want to cover this

410
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
place as much as you possibly can

411
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
in the one shot you might have and you

412
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,880
don't want to burn out and go all right

413
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,160
this is fine this is enough let's get

414
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,360
out of here and miss something really

415
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,079
cool

416
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,639
bring snacks and eat them and take

417
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,480
breaks who doesn't love snacks

418
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,959
just do it

419
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,199
let's move on to what you should have

420
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:13,920
with you

421
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,040
speaking of bananas and granola bars

422
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
i like to tell people this is my little

423
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,399
joke travel light obviously

424
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,160
because you kind of need light you're

425
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
going to need all sorts of lights

426
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,320
crazy amounts of lights here are some of

427
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,760
my favorite lights in case you don't

428
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,720
know where to start with lights

429
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,279
make sure that you have a good high

430
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,240
lumen

431
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,920
long lasting light weight

432
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,600
flashlight everybody likes to bring

433
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,240
these like

434
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,360
4d cell mag lights those suck

435
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,240
those hurt your wrist after two three

436
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,600
hours of lugging this thing around

437
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,519
you're just like

438
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,199
forget that there's no need for those

439
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,720
those don't have to exist anymore

440
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,959
they're stupid

441
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,279
get a nice lightweight flashlight that's

442
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,279
high lumen there's no end of them out

443
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:01,920
there

444
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,160
um i like to also take uh like a

445
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,079
handheld work light like you see over

446
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,399
there

447
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,800
and i actually strap it to one of my

448
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,079
backpack straps

449
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,760
so you just always have this massive

450
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
headlight right on your chest

451
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,120
broadcasting forward

452
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,760
i like to bring a head lamp as well so

453
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
that as you turn your head

454
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
uh it points the light to where you're

455
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,519
looking

456
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,040
this is great especially if you're

457
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
trying to open boxes or drawers or doors

458
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,920
or something and you have to put your

459
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,440
flashlight down you still have

460
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
a great amount of light that you can use

461
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,399
to see everything you're doing

462
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,199
phoenix and led lenser to my absolute

463
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,160
favorite

464
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,000
portable light companies look into those

465
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,040
two if you're not sure where to get

466
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,439
started

467
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
uh finally uh we're here

468
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,560
and we want to share what we've seen you

469
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:50,959
know

470
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,480
yeah it's cool to go in and see things

471
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
for yourself and certainly

472
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,600
um doing that just for the hobby of it

473
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,199
there's nothing wrong with that

474
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,120
but i'm a big fan of uh information

475
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,160
needing to be stored and shared

476
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,920
and the way we do that in these

477
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,680
facilities is of course video

478
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,959
um i don't recommend bringing gopros

479
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,759
uh if you can tell from my comments here

480
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,320
um

481
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,199
gopros ever since it seems the five have

482
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,160
been terrible

483
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,639
um they overheat all the time they just

484
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,560
turn themselves off for no reason

485
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,399
i've had three models since the five and

486
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
they all have all of these problems

487
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,959
uh i they're unreliable they are not

488
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,480
professional equipment

489
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,160
um don't just don't don't even buy one

490
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,160
um there's other gopro like things dji

491
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,480
dji makes some really good ones uh the

492
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,240
osmo action you see here the

493
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
the pocket 2 just came out really good

494
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
the audio on them not amazing but for

495
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,000
this kind of work you don't really

496
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,079
care about audio your phone

497
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,639
probably has one of the best cameras out

498
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,120
there

499
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
especially if you have like something

500
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,959
like the new iphone 12s

501
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,279
with the wide-angle lens these are

502
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,079
incredible

503
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,919
you have a 4k 125 120 frame per second

504
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,039
wide angle lens camera that you can take

505
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,679
with you

506
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,919
super lightweight extremely battery

507
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,439
efficient you can strap that to your

508
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,160
chest

509
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
uh and go also um don't strap it to your

510
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,280
head

511
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,559
strap it to your chest if you're not

512
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,720
holding it um strapping it to your head

513
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,079
creates these videos where you're

514
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,160
constantly looking around and uh

515
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,439
it makes everyone who watches your

516
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,000
videos sick so please stop doing that

517
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,039
um that aside bring your batteries

518
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,120
just bring crap tons of batteries usb

519
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,160
batteries are cheap

520
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
they're easy they're lightweight you

521
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,559
could pack a ton of them bring batteries

522
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,120
and bring i guess bring your ghost

523
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
hunting gear you know if you're into

524
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,840
that if you're a ghost hunter you're

525
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,039
trying to get into it bring your ghost

526
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,640
hunting gear i'm not going to comment on

527
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,280
that

528
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
you can go figure out what that is uh

529
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,960
and of course bring a bring a backpack

530
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,320
and not just a backpack to carry all

531
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
your stuff

532
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,080
um to carry all the stuff you might find

533
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,559
this is

534
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,559
this is archaeology this is legit

535
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,480
archaeology um this is stuff that's

536
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
gonna get destroyed if we leave it

537
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,760
it belongs in a museum maybe but

538
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,679
probably not but probably it's cool and

539
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,280
it's gonna get wrecked so take it you

540
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,840
know

541
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,600
um those of us who were boy scouts know

542
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,039
the old adage of like leave it better

543
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,240
than you found it

544
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,520
um i don't think that applies here these

545
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,400
buildings are

546
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
almost all gonna get bulldozed and

547
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
everything's gonna end up in a landfill

548
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,039
so if you find something cool i'm a big

549
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,280
proponent of take it

550
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
uh it's funny you could see here in this

551
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,039
video here's me uh scavenging hard

552
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,600
drives

553
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,120
working on a separate project right now

554
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,039
where we're going to be hosting

555
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,720
uh all of these hard drive images from

556
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
these drives we find in our dives over

557
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,440
the years

558
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,840
but that's uh not going on right now so

559
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,600
not gonna get get too deep into it

560
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,600
um personal uh like physical safety is a

561
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
big concern here

562
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,080
uh like i said your life is at stake

563
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
your body is at stake you have to be

564
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,360
serious about this

565
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,799
um it's a frivolous fun dumb hobby some

566
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,600
might think

567
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,320
but it's extremely dangerous and again

568
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,720
just like motorcycling it's it's that

569
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,440
it's really fun yes it's really

570
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,559
dangerous it's something you have to

571
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,520
keep in mind but

572
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
just like motorcycling if you wear all

573
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,039
the proper gear

574
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,919
99 of the time you're going to be fine

575
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,400
um

576
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
i really like mechanics gloves uh

577
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,679
because they're durable

578
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,200
you're gonna be grabbing a lot of rusty

579
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,880
stuff a lot of sharp stuff

580
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,240
most of that's not gonna puncture your

581
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
mechanics gloves um they're

582
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,039
cheap five to fifteen dollars for some

583
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,400
some okay ones

584
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,760
um just do that bring an n95 mask

585
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
uh they were a little harder to find

586
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,679
because of the pandemic it's easier now

587
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,600
you want n95 because the mold and

588
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
especially the asbestos you might be

589
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,480
coming across in these buildings

590
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,280
depending on when they were

591
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,160
decommissioned

592
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,600
uh in the us most of these buildings

593
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
have had their asbestos removed

594
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
but you never know um i did a wonder

595
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,919
bread factory in buffalo new york that

596
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,640
the whole top floor was all asbestos and

597
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
i had my i had my respirator

598
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,600
and that's a sealed respirator not like

599
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,520
the medical masks not the plaster

600
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,799
sanding masks the big

601
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,679
rubber filter those things where no air

602
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,600
can get in because asbestos is not a

603
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,960
joke

604
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,760
they're a little pricey 30 40 bucks also

605
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,720
be aware those filters expire

606
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
so check the dates on those before you

607
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
head out

608
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,080
some good tough jeans i like kevlar

609
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,919
motorcycle jeans

610
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,120
hard hats you don't need necessarily

611
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,400
like a big bulky

612
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,600
construction hard hat but um

613
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
like a skydiving or helmet or something

614
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
like that or snowboarding helmets are

615
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
generally enough to get you by

616
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
you're rarely going to have a steel beam

617
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,760
come down and crack you in the head

618
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,919
you might but for the most part it's

619
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,440
going to be you hitting your head on

620
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,320
stuff

621
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,679
and so just a really good solid

622
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,280
something better than a bicycle helmet

623
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,200
is the bottom line there

624
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,559
boots steel-toed boots waterproof boots

625
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,240
half these places are filled with water

626
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,880
up to your ankles down in the basements

627
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,799
so steel toes you know some really good

628
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,159
timberlands something like that

629
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,720
um but overall clothing-wise pretend

630
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,919
you're going hiking

631
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,480
uh assume you're gonna be outside these

632
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,360
places have no

633
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,080
no hvac most of them all the windows are

634
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,000
busted out you're effectively outdoors

635
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,159
dress for hiking outdoors so something

636
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,679
that's sweat wicking

637
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,919
keeps you cool but also keeps you warm

638
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,600
if it's winter you know just think if i

639
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,960
were gonna go hiking right now what

640
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,000
would i wear

641
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,080
wear that plus safety equipment you're

642
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,120
gonna be all right

643
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,960
that aside uh i don't think i got to

644
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,880
tell you too much about the buddy system

645
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,080
make sure you've got a buddy at least

646
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
one buddy with you there make sure you

647
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,480
have a buddy off site who knows where

648
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
you're going and what you're doing

649
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
that you can check in with and go hey if

650
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,360
you you don't hear from me in

651
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,520
four hours you know if you get to the

652
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
location before you go in if you have no

653
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,960
sell signal tell them like hey we've got

654
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,799
no cell signal out here

655
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,320
but if you don't hear from us in four

656
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,919
hours call the cops this is where we're

657
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,559
at

658
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,200
um otherwise if you have cell signal

659
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,400
tell me hey i'm going to check in every

660
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,240
hour or check in with me every hour

661
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,760
something that easy and if you don't

662
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
hear from me call the cops

663
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,320
if you get hurt and are stuck call the

664
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,080
cops call 9-1-1

665
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,240
um get an ambulance in there tell them

666
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,600
where you're at tell them how to get

667
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,720
into the place

668
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
tell them how to find you once you're in

669
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,720
there they'll often keep you on the line

670
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,000
uh just so they can make sure that

671
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,919
you're found um it it's

672
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,400
it it's it's worth it it's worth the you

673
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
know five thousand dollar whatever fine

674
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,480
you got might get hit with to say

675
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
prevent the loss of a limb because you

676
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,559
broke your leg and wanted to hobble out

677
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,640
without getting caught don't be afraid

678
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,679
to call 9-1-1

679
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
moving away from from safety gear let's

680
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,600
talk about

681
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,360
security bypassing gear you might think

682
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,799
that this is a huge part of it because

683
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,080
you're breaking into buildings

684
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,960
in reality it's not it's a very small

685
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,159
part of it if at all

686
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,520
most of the times you can get away with

687
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
not needing any of this stuff

688
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
um the top things i recommend are the

689
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,039
multi-tool

690
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,000
because that comes in hand it's a

691
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,360
multi-tool you can use it for all kinds

692
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,039
of crap um a loom hook

693
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,559
which i don't have near me um look it up

694
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,159
it's real common it is great for

695
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,760
slipping into stuff and just pushing

696
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,880
pushing latches open

697
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,240
it is amazing you'll get through so many

698
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,280
doors with just a stupid loom hook

699
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,440
there are common keys that open a lot of

700
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
boxes especially fire department boxes

701
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,960
and elevator boxes buildings that have

702
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,559
like key boxes

703
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,960
make sure you have a wheel a key box

704
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,640
wheel lock decoder

705
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,840
tool um that's really cool to have

706
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,360
i mentioned deviant here he give a

707
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,880
really good talk at hope 11

708
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,039
on common keys you know things that are

709
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
key to like so you can keep a small key

710
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,679
ring of keys that are

711
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,440
going to open a lot of things you might

712
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,760
come across so go watch that talk

713
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,559
that aside um jigglers are handy for

714
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,720
wafer locks if you like to dig through

715
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
filing cabinets those are really good um

716
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,400
i'm not a fan of picks they take too

717
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,320
long if you got to pick a lock it's to

718
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,600
get out of there it's it's probably not

719
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,240
worth it

720
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,320
and there's probably another way past

721
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
the door that you're already trying to

722
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,039
pick the lock on so unless you're

723
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,000
really really good at picking locks i

724
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,320
say

725
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,960
i say bypass those and finally of course

726
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,159
you know you could bypass plenty of

727
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,120
locks with some

728
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,440
some bolt cutters um those are often

729
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,080
huge and heavy they suck to lug around

730
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,000
uh they're hard to hide in a backpack or

731
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,559
anywhere else so they're super

732
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,080
um super suspicious

733
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,640
uh it's hard to explain why you have

734
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,360
those

735
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,880
and not say you're trying to break into

736
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,400
places so i just avoid those all

737
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,120
together again

738
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,799
it's so rare i come across a situation

739
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,720
that needs any of that so

740
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,279
um hopefully uh that was enough to get

741
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,080
you started

742
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,679
looks like uh i'm getting out of here

743
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,440
right on time so that's super cool

744
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,960
probably the first time i've ever given

745
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
a talk with a little time left over

746

797
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,120
tyler have you ever done a physical

798
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,000
penetration testing

799
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,159
yeah yeah spent a lot of time doing that

800
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,120
the

801
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,440
the very last one before covet as i was

802
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,880
getting x-filled

803
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,679
from my country so i didn't have to

804
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,240
spend the next nine months in it

805
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
we actually were breaking into a place

806
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,440
and uh

807
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,520
ended up popping out the wrong door into

808
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,720
an embassy

809
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
with with a nice m5 at our face so it

810
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,880
was uh interesting

811
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,080
i had i had something similar happen in

812
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,279
east st louis so in the us

813
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,799
oh wow yeah uh i had sorry about

814
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,960
my green screen not working today uh i

815
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,039
have opted to stop screwing with that so

816
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,399
that i can talk to you

817
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,679
i don't know what's wrong with it it

818
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,200
looks like a green screen it's working

819
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,960
great yeah right yeah it's it's being a

820
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,880
green screen it's doing fine

821
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,799
yeah coping tip for everyone at home

822
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,720
don't paint your wall green

823
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,399
this is the ugliest thing to have to

824
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
look at all the time this is actually my

825
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,559
wall

826
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,880
so you went all in with the paint uh

827
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,720
look good on paper it does not look good

828
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,200
on wall

829
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,279
so it works really well normally except

830
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,679
when i turn around i'm like oh my god

831
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,039
i have to live with this uh it's fun

832
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,000
normally

833
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,640
anyway yeah i had uh i was doing a

834
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,600
physical pen test

835
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,799
on a chemical plant in east st louis and

836
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,200
it was

837
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,720
one of only two facilities this company

838
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,840
had that was

839
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,240
that had armed guards the rest of the

840
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,520
facilities didn't

841
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,039
and i had already done three of their

842
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,799
facilities and so i was just going in

843
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,279
like

844
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,480
nothing and i was parked off

845
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,240
campus across the street um

846
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,919
in east st louis one of the most

847
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,919
dangerous neighborhoods in america

848
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,919
and i am in a lexus in a very nice suit

849
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,840
perked across the street

850
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,480
just after driving real slow around the

851
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,360
place once

852
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,840
and i'm and and this guard leaves the

853
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,799
bunker

854
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,080
crosses like leaves the campus

855
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,600
with uh with this ar-15

856
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,039
out approaches the car

857
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,960
like driver's side window like doesn't

858
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,399
get down to talk to me

859
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,799
just like gun in my face like not

860
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,720
pointed but

861
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,960
gun in my face is there something i

862
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,000
could help you with sir

863
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
no yeah and the client the client did

864
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,559
not inform us that there would be armed

865
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,480
guards let alone like this isn't sidearm

866
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,120
this is

867
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,720
you know this is a rifle

868
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
it's always those ones that you you find

869
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,000
out are armed later that are the worst

870
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,240
it's uh definitely a question you ask is

871
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,200
there dogs

872
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,760
and is is there armed guards and we i

873
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,440
was working for a company that didn't

874
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,840
do armed guard penetration like we just

875
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,640
didn't we

876
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,799
declined that work we weren't prepared

877
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,480
for it i certainly wasn't

878
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,080
my pants weren't and

879
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,320
usually so the lesson learned is where

880
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,559
the brown pants yeah

881
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,880
yeah and get the uh insurance coverage

882
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,840
on the rental car

883
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,720
you got to clean that up so what

884
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,320
happened so you you of course were like

885
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,159
oh no i'm just on my way oh

886
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,640
so they i said no and then they directed

887
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,240
me to go park over there

888
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,039
and so i did comply and in the meantime

889
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,399
called my boss and said hey

890
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,480
snafu uh i need an evac

891
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,840
and he and he of course this yeah is

892
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,360
i've got you know you've got your get

893
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,440
out of jail free letter and i

894
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,039
pull it out of my sock and i hand it to

895
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,480
the guard and he goes alright well you

896
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,840
wait here and i'm gonna go call this

897
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,640
phone number

898
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,240
and they don't just leave you alone they

899
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,080
leave you with another guy who shows up

900
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,120
with an ar

901
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,399
and just stares at you

902
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,159
yeah so that was but then they you know

903
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,679
they're like all right uh

904
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,000
you should leave now and i did then i

905
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,120
went home and it was funny because i had

906
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,559
flown in that morning

907
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,840
and flew out that night those one-way

908
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,600
tickets are always a thing for

909
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,799
physical stuff yeah

910
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,720
just also nothing to do with my talk

911
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,000
here whatsoever

912
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,080
well no it does because i mean that is a

913
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,120
component

914
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,880
to these things you're just there there

915
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
might be fewer people around that you

916
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,440
have to deal with

917
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,799
but you still have a lot of the same

918
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,880
kind of physical obstacles

919
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,640
you absolutely do and depending on what

920
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
you're uh getting into

921
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,799
uh you know some of my favorite sites

922
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,240
are not

923
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,320
abandoned because they're long disused

924
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,600
but sometimes because they're currently

925
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,880
being built

926
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,600
and some of those sites are going to

927
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,399
actually have

928
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,640
you know active electronic security in

929
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,919
place that you

930
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,399
you know should never bypass and you

931
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,000
should just go home and obey the law

932
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,919
definitely knowing what is what is

933
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,080
around from a visual standpoint because

934
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,880
that is

935
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,159
you know like um casing the place

936
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,279
um checking it out beforehand and

937
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,320
knowing what you're going to get up

938
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,600
against before you

939
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,399
even take a step onto the property is a

940
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,360
huge

941
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,600
part of the time spent in this you know

942
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,919
you watch videos on youtube and stuff

943
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,679
of like people just you know going

944
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,440
around inside these places and videoing

945
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,720
everything and posting it online you

946
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,240
think oh that looks fun and easy but

947
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,799
like it

948
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,960
you know none of that video includes the

949
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,480
amount of recon you know

950
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,120
sitting on google satellite images and

951
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,919
um

952
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,000
lately you know i'll send my drone up

953
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
and do

954
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,279
quite a number of laps around the place

955
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,960
looking for you know is the rooftop

956
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,159
access is there

957
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,559
access to the back the last place i did

958
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,399
we actually had to walk along

959
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,320
some freight rail tracks for a very long

960
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,080
time to get to the rear of the building

961
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,679
that used to take in

962
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,360
loads from freight trains that would

963
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,760
stop behind it and there happened to be

964
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,279
a way in back there but

965
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,440
you couldn't just go around the building

966
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,200
because it was fenced off forever but we

967
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,960
found if you walk along the tracks far

968
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,679
enough

969
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,279
you can get right back there and the

970
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,880
drone found that so it's

971
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,559
recon is a huge part of it it makes your

972
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,559
job a lot easier once you get down there

973
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,799
because you also you don't want to be

974
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,200
bombing around outside like i said you

975
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,840
know

976
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,440
you're jiggling all the doors and

977
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,200
peeping in the windows you want to

978
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
really have a great idea of how you're

979
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,799
going to get out of the public eye as

980
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,559
soon as possible before you get down

981
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,559
there

982
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,919
that's pretty awesome man yeah there's

983
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,519
some that was some cool footage in the

984
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,200
background i love the idea of just

985
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,120
doing your talk with footage running it

986
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,279
was that was entertaining

987
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,519
i plan on doing that even once we start

988
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,120
doing these things live again

989
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,600
um that was it's so much fun it gives

990
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,480
you you know

991
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
if a picture is worth a thousand words

992
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,240
of video is worth ten thousand

993
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,960
um and it's it's super fun it's super

994
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,080
easy to do

995
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,320
um i could do it live now for sure and

996
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,000
so i think going forward that's how all

997
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,080
my talks are gonna be and so i just

998
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,159
i make my slides with transparent

999
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,240
backgrounds just alpha blended so

1000
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,679
whatever's in the background just shows

1001
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,519
through and that's all that was

1002
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,960
yeah see i want to see you take it to

1003
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,360
9000 and i want you to do

1004
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,240
the the exploration live while you're

1005
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,960
doing the talk

twitch stream uh that was super fun

um i would do that again downside is

1019
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,079
um it is a violation of most streaming

1020
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:38,960
services

1021
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,960
because you're breaking the law and but

1022
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,199
it was super freaking fun and people

1023
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,159

1059
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,200
abandoned places that i can get into

1060
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,720
because i'm like look i'm here i've

1061
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,400
taken the time to fly out to this place

1062
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,320
often if i'm presenting i'm presenting

1063
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,119
on

1064
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,520

1065
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,720
extra days of

1066
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,640
no obligation so i go what kind of

1067
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,040
trouble can i get into

1068
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,560
and that's what this is that's fantastic

1069
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,480
hey that would be the national version

1070
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
is uh what phrases to know to get

1071
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,040
yourself out of trouble

1072
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,480
oh i i'm sorry i'm a dumb american

1073
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,920
oh that's that's the only one you're

1074
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,680

1075
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,480
american hot hub hablo and glace

1076
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,400

1077
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,240
you're in germany or something

1078
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,680
and that's that's definitely a worry i

1079
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,760
did so when i was at um chaos computer

1080
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,400
congress in

1081
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,359
in berlin well near berlin um i was like

1082
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,200
hey what can we break into around here

1083
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
is to really get into trouble because

1084
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,760
we're on a visitor's visa

1085
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,160
uh and we uh again it's on my youtube

1086
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,200
channel um

1087
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,520
there's a an abandoned world war ii

1088
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,720
children's hospital

1089
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,480
way on the outskirts of berlin and i was

1090
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,359
like we have to go do this

1091
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,920
and uh it was quite a bit of effort just

1092
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,280
to get inside

1093
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,720
and yeah in the back of your head the

1094
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,079
whole time you're like man if we get

1095
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,599
caught

1096
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,240
what what i don't what where do we know

1097
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,599
where the american embassy is

1098
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,160
and in reality like again it's just

1099
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,359
trespassing

1100
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,599
um you know when it was closer to 9 11

1101
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,760
there were more things to worry about um

1102
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,440
law enforcement was more on

1103
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,880
edge about what are you doing in here

1104
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,400
but these days that really seems to have

1105
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,920
calmed down and like in the end like

1106
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,440
worst case scenario they're going to

1107
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,800
tell you to go back to america and put

1108
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,720

1109
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,000

1153
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,880

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,400
laptops so you get like

1170
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,359
you know the the the golden age of when

1171
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,040
nobody had laptops and you get to see

1172
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,320
what those look like on the inside

1173
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,640
because it's so much different than now

1174
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,640
um but those are fun because you're just

1175
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,240
just completely destroying something and

1176
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,280
it's just hanging out

1177
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,880
it's chatting it's catching up with

1178
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,960
people it's it's a it's

1179
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,320

with a zero and a four like my twitter

1184
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,400
handle you actually have laptops that

1185
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,800
were

1186
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,000
made in america that old

1187
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,160
oh oh ah jeez i'd have to look i have a

1188
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,839
compact one i'm going to take apart

1189
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,920
tonight that might have been it's a

1190
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,160
pentium i think it's a pentium 100.

1191
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,079
so i don't know that might be

1192
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,599
american made that's why

1193
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,200
yeah people actually that one was just

1194
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,040
sent to me by someone who was like you

1195
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,720
should take this apart so i have fans on

1196
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,319
twitch now who send me things to

1197
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,640
dismantle

1198
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,960
that's very weird what's the what's the

1199
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,839
weirdest thing you've got yet

1200
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,280
oh i just did um a

1201
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,720
oh it's gone i'm looking for it i

1202
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,839
dismantled it it's gone uh

1203
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,560
a wag uh so that we have there's a dog

1204
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,720
walking service called wag

1205
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,359
um and they have these key boxes you

1206
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,480
know the little

1207
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,240
the same ones kind of like realtors use

1208
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,599
but it's got their big logo on it and

1209
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,240
they

1210
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,760
give it to you and they go hey we'll

1211
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,400
sell we'll send you a secure key box

1212
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,319
that so that you know you can make sure

1213
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,760
your dog rocker is keys to your house

1214
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,480
and

1215
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,920
they they they push that it's like

1216
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,680
secure and they've actually replaced the

1217
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,440
ones they used twice because they were

1218
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
so insecure and so now they got this one

1219
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,280
and i was and i couldn't find

1220
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,880
a video of anyone doing a bypass

1221
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,560
on that one so i was like all right i'll

1222
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,880
do that so somebody had sent me one like

1223
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,880
and uh so i did not only said here's how

1224
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,560
you decode the combination to figure it

1225
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,400
out to do a syrup dishes bypass and you

1226
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,760
know the idea being that like you can

1227
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,520
take the keys out go make a copy of them

1228
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,560
put them back

1229
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,680
nobody knows that happened but then

1230
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,680
i did a full teardown of the lock so you

1231
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,839
can see on the inside how the decoding

1232
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:42,960
works

1233
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
um so you could see the little you know

1234
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,680
notch that you're looking for with the

1235
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
decoder tool and see it from inside the

1236
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,040
lock which i thought was really cool and

1237
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,400
people got a big kick out of that

1238
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,760
because it's one thing to teach people

1239
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,440
like well put your decoder in and

1240
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,359
then you got to kind of feel for it and

1241
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,480
hope whereas

1242
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,560
i can go on camera and go see here's the

1243
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,079
inside of it after you've done this full

1244
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,920
teardown and really explain what you're

1245
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,319
feeling and why and how it works and so

1246
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,079
um i think that was the most out of the

1247
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,760
ordinary thing that i did that

1248
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,200
ended up being really fun on twitch and

1249
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,040
that was just a few weeks ago

1250
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,920
that's pretty cool yeah and again it's

1251
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,800
on the youtube

1252
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,280
i put all the stuff over there you

1253
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,480
haven't had uh youtube

1254
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,400
take any of your stuff down yet huh uh

1255
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,839
uh no not take any of it down no um i'll

1256
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,680
get a copyright claim now and then for

1257
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,480
like

1258
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,160
it seems like no matter how much you

1259
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,680
know copyright free music you use

1260
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,280
that you still get flagged so it's like

1261
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,560
ah whatever and that's easy enough to

1262
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,760
fix they've actually got a really cool

1263
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,040
system for it now which

1264
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,280
does it uses uh technology similar to

1265
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,640
how noise reduction works

1266
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,480
where it'll just identify the music in

1267
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,160
the background of your video

1268
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,800
and just blank that out without uh

1269
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,359
adjust

1270
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,760
affecting the vote the the speaking too

1271
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,119
much and that's pretty cool

1272
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,800
so even youtube is like hey you can't

1273
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,640
use that music but we're super we don't

1274
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,000
want to take your video down so let us

1275
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,240
help you just get rid of that music

1276
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,400
whereas twitch has just been twitch has

1277
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,680
been doing everything like that the

1278
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,280
wrong way and really pissing a lot of

1279
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,560
people off

1280
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,480
um but i get that they don't have the

1281
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,079
money that youtube has to do things the

1282
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,200
right way

1283
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,000
so we'll see what the next streaming

1284
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,520
service is after everybody abandons

1285
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,040
twitch

1286
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,680
i hear it's uh what is it pornhub and

1287
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,200
any friend or whatever that other one

1288
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,119
is everybody's stories and stuff there

1289
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,480
yeah well so

1290
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,319
that's because they the credit companies

1291
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,720
have stopped allowing payments to them

1292
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
so yeah their funding has been cut off

1293
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,960
and when you no longer have money coming

1294
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,800
in you're really open to making some

1295
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,160
changes

1296
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,599
um yeah it what sucks though is that

1297
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,040
like it's not being done across the

1298
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,520
board like visa and mastercard are just

1299
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,680
targeting specific companies which seems

1300
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,040
like [ __ ] like

1301
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,880
if you're gonna try to pretend to be

1302
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,240
altruistic

1303
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,640
you have to be fair you have you know

1304
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,359
you have to

1305
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,000
say everything not just these specific

1306
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,359
companies who are doing what

1307
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,640
everyone is doing yeah yeah it sounds a

1308
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,319
little political

1309
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,839
yeah um oh i do can uh if i can plug

1310
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,200
defcon at your con

1311
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,680
um we're i'm doing uh we're still doing

1312
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,599
drunk hacker history that we normally do

1313
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,880
at defcon but we're doing that at new

1314
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,520
year's eve

1315
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,920
uh tomorrow so catch us at 9 eastern

1316
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,160
on the defcon discord the new year's eve

1317
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
stream so that's another thing i'm doing

1318
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,079
this year and that's going to be

1319
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,319
we're going to be playing goldeneye 64

1320
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,560
and telling old stories about defcon and

1321
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,160
having guests on and stuff so that's

1322
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,680
another thing i've been trying to do is

1323
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,880
just

1324
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,280
more fun stuff like this and like stuff

1325
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,160
that's not

1326
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,960
technical presentations because there's

1327
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,480
always somebody who knows more than i do

1328
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,680
there's always somebody who can present

1329
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,599
