7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,880
doing

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,359
great although it is uh not today

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,119
anymore as it is

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,599
night time over here where are you

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,360
i'm actually calling in from tokyo

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
tonight tokyo

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
tokyo yes it is about uh almost 2 a.m

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,640
over here

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
and i'm full of energy i had some coffee

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,160
so uh

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,840
hopefully we'll not fall asleep during

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,399
my presentation but

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,079
yeah that's all right i'm afraid we

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,760
don't have artificial intelligence at

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,039
the point yet that we can

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
keep you awake with like poking you or

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,199
something

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,199
or even better just deep fake my face

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,520
and do the presentation for me

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,800
make sure the mouse keeps moving the

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,400
eyes are open exactly exactly just

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
you know a whole deal so ah

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,700
it was a it was it was a great um

30
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,119
[Music]

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,640
excuse me the the talk that just

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,479
finished was really great and especially

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,479
um interesting for me because i work in

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,640
the autonomous vehicle sector

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,080
and so decision making is a huge part

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,799
of conversation surrounding ethics and

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,560
autonomous vehicles

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
and so i'm i learned i learned a lot i

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
learned a lot

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,320
so you are the weapon we're giving the

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
ai

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,079
no i'm doing my best to make sure nobody

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,840
else turns it into a weapon

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,360
okay but yeah i would you could argue

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,040
that the first weapons are going to be

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,399
vehicles because they are

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
very very heavy very quickly moving

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,799
missiles

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,840
that are everywhere and if your car gets

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
hacked

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,079
and god forbid uh no one made sure

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,479
the proper sandboxing measures were in

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,399
place

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,040
we might have a problem with uh zombie

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,399
cars causing mayhem

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,200
all over the place but although and

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
that's why you're going to talk

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,479
to us about bluetooth security in them

59
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
that is the plan i have to because

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
the the go to webinar thing kind of

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,239
minimized itself and so now i need to

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,040
figure out

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,239
how to share my screen again okay

64
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,120
okay show my screen here we go so let me

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,680
see

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
i need to choose which screen i'm

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,000
showing okay

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,599
and the one i would like to show take

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
the one with passwords on it

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,440
that's always my favorite that one's in

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,800
the other room i'm afraid i don't

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,760
actually have it connected to this

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,040
computer

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
but you can have this one right now

75
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,239
because i think

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,959
uh that is not it so powerpoint likes to

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,080
split it into two

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
monitors so we're just gonna say this

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
one how does that look can you can

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
everybody see what i'm hopefully

81
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,879
presenting

82
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,080
okay wonderful so um if

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
i'm all good to go i will go ahead and

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,480

85
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,519
so let me

86
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,519

87
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,040

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
windows around here because go to

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,400
webinar likes to spawn

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,239
three or four windows that i'm trying to

91
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,000
trying to manage while still being able

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
to read my notes

93
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,879
because god knows i'm gonna need to read

94
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,200

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720

kamel gali

99
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,599
and i'm going to be talking about the

100
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,120
door no one tried

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
bluetooth as a rising concern in

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,799
automotive cyber security

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,400
very short introduction about myself

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,640
my name is kamel gali once again i am by

105
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,159
title an automotive

106
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,400
cyber security technology architect at

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,599
white motion

108
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,040
white motion is a very small subsidiary

109
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,599
of a

110
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
very large italian automotive supplier

111
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,239
that automotive supplier being the

112
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,920
company called morelli really is

113
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,959
actually the

114
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,879
combined entity of two former smaller

115
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,959
uh automotive tier one suppliers called

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
kasonic kansai and magnetimerely they

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,000
emerged about

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,640
two or three years ago and at the time

119
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,400
white motion was a subsidiary of casana

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
kansai and now i'm part of

121
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
the family so got that out of the way so

122
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,519
i'm based in tokyo

123
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,959
and that is where i'm calling from

124
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,519
tonight i'm a trilingual car hacking

125
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,959
enthusiast i speak english

126
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,280
arabic and and japanese and i am a

127
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
rather invested member of the automotive

128
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,919
cyber security industry and community

129
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,680
so that includes participation things

130
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
like grim con where i can share

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,360
some information about the industry that

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,960
i love as well as the

133
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
automotive security research group which

134
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,360
is an organization that does a lot of

135
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
work to help spread awareness for

136
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,800
automotive cyber security and help

137
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,360
enable

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,160
cooperation collaboration and learning

139
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,080
among the members of the industry

140
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,600
i'm by no means a brilliant lead hacker

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,919
i'm kind of a jack of some trades master

142
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,680
of none my recent areas of interest

143
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,400
are bluetooth usb protocol lock picking

144
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,160
digital forensics and i have some other

145
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,720
hobbies

146
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,880
down there as well um for those of you

147
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
who couldn't make the connection that is

148
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
me in the background picture

149
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,960
so listed here are some of the events

150
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
that i've given talks at

151
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,520
throughout 2020 i'm sharing this not to

152
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
flex on the audience but because some of

153
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,199
the talks i've delivered might be

154
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,639
helpful for anyone

155
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
learning to learn more about the subject

156
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,720
of today's discussion

157
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
i'm going to be skipping over some of

158
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,720
the more basic aspects of bluetooth and

159
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,080
bluetooth security

160
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,320
but i did give a talk at the first grim

161
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
con in the new speakers track

162
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
um called bluetooth security and why we

163
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
need more people studying it

164
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
if anyone is interested in a kind of an

165
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
overview of the state of bluetooth

166
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,919
security

167
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,440
in 2020 um maybe my talk there would be

168
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,039
a good place to start

169
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,759
um but also at defcon safe mode for the

170
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,800
car hacking village

171
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
another organization that does a lot to

172
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,039
promote awareness of automotive security

173
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,440
i gave a couple talks one for automotive

174
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,319
bluetooth

175
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,240
and one on in vehicle networks for

176
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
anyone who's interested in learning more

177
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
about those

178
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
presentation is not going to be hands-on

179
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
but it's going to be more theoretical

180
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
and i'm going to be looking at the role

181
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,319
that bluetooth has played in automotive

182
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,759
security historically

183
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,360
and i have a couple of short case

184
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
studies that i'd like to go over that

185
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,080
discuss some

186
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,400
recently disclosed automotive bluetooth

187
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
vulnerabilities

188
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,960
so bluetooth and cars a

189
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
rather fruitful symbiotic relationship

190
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,039
so in the 2000s bluetooth began to

191
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,240
establish itself

192
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,120
as a leading short-range communication

193
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,039
technology designed for

194
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,440
cable replacement it's now one of the

195
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
most commonly used technologies in iot

196
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
products around the world and because of

197
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
its ubiquity

198
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,479
it found its home in automobiles fairly

199
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
early preceding features such as wi-fi

200
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,160
and cellular connections in vehicles

201
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,680
the first use case for bluetooth in

202
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,599
vehicles was centered around

203
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,280
hands-free calling allowing people to

204
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,800
safely talk on the phone through their

205
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
car's audio system

206
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
this is around the time cell phones

207
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,319
began to become more common and

208
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,639
car phones became a thing of the past

209
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,599
you know

210
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,680
very outdated i think my dad's car had a

211
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,120
car phone

212
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
but in today's uh vehicles you're very

213
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,120
hard-pressed to find a actual car phone

214
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,479
but eventually bluetooth began to be

215
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,000
used in a lot more than

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,800
just hands-free calling right so

217
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,080
hands-free calling shifted into

218
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,759
multimedia control so now you can

219
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,280
actually have your music library

220
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,560
uploaded to your vehicle

221
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,919
or not even uploaded to your vehicle

222
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,360
just stream through your vehicle

223
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
speakers and you can control

224
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
your playlist you know skip pause fast

225
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
forward all through your phone

226
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,319
through that bluetooth connection

227
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,560
later implementations introduce things

228
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
like phone book access and the ability

229
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,199
to send

230
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,840
text messages so phone book access is

231
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,599
the idea that when you receive a call

232
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,440
and you want to answer it hands-free

233
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
your infotainment system

234
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,639
would actually have stored inside it

235
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,199
your call history your contacts and it

236
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,800
would tell you

237
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
displayed on the infotainment system so

238
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,520
you don't have to look at your phone

239
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,560
while you're driving

240
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,680
who's calling you right so

241
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,960
this is the introduction of really

242
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
important personally identifiable

243
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,879
information into the vehicle

244
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,199
ecosystem from a bluetooth perspective

245
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,360
right some vehicles even had the ability

246
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
to send text messages

247
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
through your phone in the event you

248
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
received a text message while driving

249
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,039
you could enable a setting that said

250
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,559
okay i want my card to automatically

251
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,799
respond or prompt my phone to

252
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,399
automatically respond

253
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
to say hey i'm driving i'll get back to

254
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,439
you later something like that

255
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
more recently though bluetooth has even

256
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,680
been used to update

257
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,640
key fob firmware this is something that

258
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
i only learned about very recently and

259
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,839
is going to be the target

260
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
of a short case study i have planned for

261
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
us later but for now it's good to know

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
that bluetooth is going to probably

263
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,680
expand the range of its usage

264
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,279
in the vehicular environment so

265
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,440
bluetooth is pretty secure right

266
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
so when it compared side by side to

267
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,720
different short range wireless protocols

268
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,320
bluetooth seems like a pretty secure

269
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,560
option for wireless communication

270
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,640
it has built into the design of the

271
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
specification

272
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,680
a couple of different security features

273
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,200
such as frequency hopping throughout the

274
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
2.4 gigahertz spectrum

275
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,480
this feature makes it almost impossible

276
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,839
to sniff as you would sniff wi-fi for

277
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,480
example

278
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,120
and in 2007 there was a large update to

279
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
the bluetooth specification

280
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,640
called the 2.1 plus enhanced data rate i

281
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,360
believe

282
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,640
um update to bluetooth when bluetooth

283
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,519
first came out

284
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
it was riddled with a lot of strange

285
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,440
bugs and quirks that you could abuse

286
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
to send business cards to people without

287
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,200
ever connecting to their phone or

288
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
pairing with them

289
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,600
and it was filled with little security

290
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,079
holes

291
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,079
that eventually got fixed and then

292
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,360
bluetooth 2.1

293
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
introduced what's called secure simple

294
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,519
pairing which is a pairing procedure

295
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,640
that is

296
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,320
much better than the original legacy

297
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,839
pairing especially for devices that

298
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,800
didn't have

299
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
an input or a display to actually

300
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,839
display information

301
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,519
this also introduced encryption data

302
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,160
signing

303
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,360
so on and so forth but because of this

304
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,560
notion that

305
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
bluetooth is pretty secure for a long

306
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
time there wasn't much research done on

307
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,000
it

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,399
due in part to some aspects of its

309
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,640
research being very cost prohibitive

310
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,200
for example the frequency hopping makes

311
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,880
it so that if you wanted to

312
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,240
really capture a full bluetooth

313
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,000
transaction over the air like on the

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,120
physical layer

315
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
you needed to invest in some hardware

316
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
that was worth

317
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,000
fourteen thousand dollars it was um

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
i believe even more expensive for more

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
later versions but

320
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,800
you were looking at a very very

321
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,720
expensive piece of hardware if you were

322
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,600
hoping to do that kind of research

323
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
but in recent years there have been a

324
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,360
lot of

325
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,279
vulnerabilities vulnerabilities

326
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,959
disclosed related to bluetooth for

327
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,160
example

328
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
the knob attack and blueborne and

329
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,600
internal blue

330
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,279
i won't go too much into detail about

331
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,360
those specific vulnerabilities

332
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,279
but i will say that anyone who's

333
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,279
interested in hearing more about those i

334
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:23,839
recommend

335
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,959
um watching my grim con zero one talk

336
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,680
where i do discuss modern bluetooth

337
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,839
security research

338
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,720
so bluetooth attacks targeted vehicles

339
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,079
we're going to look through a couple of

340
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,279
different ways

341
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,959
that bluetooth has been targeted by

342
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,399
people hoping to

343
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,560
hack vehicles or interfere with

344
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
communications etc

345
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,480
i want to disclaim give a short

346
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,000
disclaimer that i had

347
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,240
nothing to do with the research or these

348
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,079
disclosures i'm just a huge fan of the

349
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,440
work that they've done

350
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,920
and i'm hoping to kind of just share

351
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,880
with the audience

352
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,000
the fact that they exist and maybe

353
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,839
give some credit to the researchers

354
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,240
who've done such an amazing job

355
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
so car whisperer the first application

356
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
for bluetooth

357
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
was centered around hands-free phone

358
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
usage for phone calls

359
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,320
it reasoned that the earliest bluetooth

360
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,160
attacks targeted at vehicles

361
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,519
would seek to target that same

362
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,279
functionality

363
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,800
eavesdropping on the connection between

364
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,120
a vehicle or other hands-free handset

365
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,680
headset device by the way was the target

366
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,360
of the car whisperer project by

367
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,079
tri-finite group car whisperer took

368
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,360
advantage of the fact

369
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,680
that a lot of cars at the time used a

370
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,279
standard bluetooth pass key for their

371
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,120
bluetooth pairing

372
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
this research was presented in july of

373
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,680
2005 mind you so this has been

374
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
a hot topic for car hackers for quite a

375
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,199
long time now

376
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
the program would scan for any available

377
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,320
headset devices and based on the

378
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,639
manufacturer id of that device

379
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,399
which by the way is information that is

380
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,440
readily broadcast by the device

381
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
by all bluetooth devices they would dig

382
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,839
up likely default pass keys based on the

383
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,000
manufacturer

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,519
they would then try these default pass

385
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,800
keys and if they worked they could

386
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
establish

387
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
a kind of a man in the middle attack

388
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,320
where they were able to eavesdrop on the

389
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,839
conversation

390
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,240
and more interestingly they could

391
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,360
actually inject

392
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,560
audio into the phone call right it's

393
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,240
very interesting to think that you could

394
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,760
actually hijack this bluetooth

395
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,200
connection

396
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,120
and insert your own audio so this is a

397
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,360
big deal like if someone's driving a car

398
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,320
and you insert audio of like a police

399
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,120
siren

400
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,519
right you have this situation where

401
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,320
somebody might be inclined to pull over

402
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,680
right because they think oh snap like

403
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,519
cop car trying to pull me over i don't

404
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,279
see a cop and all of a sudden you're

405
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,800
getting robbed by whoever is

406
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
interfering with your bluetooth

407
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
connection right

408
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,560
but it could also be phony approval of a

409
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,399
large bank transfer or just

410
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,480
kind words of encouragement really it's

411
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,079
it's all up to your imagination at that

412
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,920
point

413
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,320
the next generic type of attack is

414
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,320
ivi crashing so this next type of attack

415
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,880
that bluetooth systems and vehicles have

416
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,360
been

417
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,560
targeted with target the inner processes

418
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360
of the system not bluetooth itself so it

419
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,920
goes

420
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,600
a little bit farther than just the

421
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
bluetooth stack so

422
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
by crafting a custom device name to

423
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,839
include special characters such as

424
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,199
percent sign x

425
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,519
improper input validation bugs and other

426
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,199
formats string vulnerabilities

427
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,320
could be executed remotely theoretically

428
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,480
this could even lead to buffer overflows

429
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,399
or remote code execution

430
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,720
depending on the makeup of the system in

431
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
a lot of cases

432
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,079
passing a sam a simple improper input is

433
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,120
enough to

434
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,839
cause the ivi system to crash requiring

435
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,800
a reboot

436
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,120
and then in some extreme cases you might

437
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
actually overwrite something very

438
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,160
important and cause

439
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,399
permanent damage to your system leading

440
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,279
to a

441
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,639
bricked bluetooth device

442
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,240
this particular attack is worth going

443
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,320
over because it leads directly into the

444
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,519
first short case study that i've

445
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
prepared for today it hammers home the

446
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,000
fact

447
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
that even if the bluetooth

448
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
implementation itself is secure

449
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,279
it can be used as an access point to an

450
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,839
ibi system running insecure software

451
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,440
all of those internal vulnerabilities

452
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,519
you thought nobody would find because oh

453
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,600
it's on a library running on the chip

454
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,279
inside the device

455
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,639
there's no way anybody could exploit

456
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,279
this right but no

457
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,199
someone will find it right someone will

458
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,279
find it

459
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,759
it will get within an arm's reach or

460
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,800
whatever the range

461
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,560
of whatever bluetooth you're using

462
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
happens to be

463
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,759
so the first shortcase study i have

464
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,399
prepared is going to be covering the

465
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,120
lexus bluetooth hack that was disclosed

466
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,680
in march

467
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,920
2 of 2020. so this is actually something

468
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320
that was disclosed this this year

469
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,680
by the keen labs owned by tencent

470
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,360
right this particular disclosure kicked

471
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,720
up quite a bit of a storm in the

472
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,639
japanese automotive industry

473
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,279
especially because toyota is seen as the

474
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:09,920
big dog

475
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,639
in the japanese automotive industry and

476
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,279
anytime

477
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,040
something happens to toyota especially

478
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
when it's related to security

479
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,480
the other japanese oems get kind of like

480
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,880
where the like do we need to worry about

481
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,240
this too like is this

482
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,000
a particular vulnerability that affects

483
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,199
our vehicles as well so on and so forth

484
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,320
but keyan labs showed that through a

485
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,000
vulnerability in the vehicle's bluetooth

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,639
stack

487
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,240
they could execute commands without

488
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,680
having to pair with

489
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,120
the vehicle the exact same vulnerability

490
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,839
that led to this is not explicitly

491
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,680
stated in the summary of the research

492
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,199
posted on their website

493
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,600
but some cve databases will credit

494
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,480
blueborne as being the culprit

495
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
blueborne by the way for any of you who

496
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959
don't know is a suite of high impact

497
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,399
bluetooth remote code execution

498
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,000
vulnerabilities that were disclosed in

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,199
2017

500
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,400
by armist labs so

501
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
because bluetooth was running with root

502
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,160
user privileges

503
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
the researchers were able to send

504
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,559
instructions to construct a wi-fi based

505
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,359
backdoor

506
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,959
that would automatically grant them a

507
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,280
root shell this let the researchers have

508
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
a persistent presence on the device

509
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,760
running linux by the way and allow them

510
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
to further exploit it from a

511
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,039
farther range than allowed by bluetooth

512
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,280
because wi-fi does have

513
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
in most cases a longer range than

514
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,440
bluetooth

515
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,600
so you had this situation where this in

516
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
vehicle infotainment system

517
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,039
is running a bluetooth stack

518
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,440
on a chip that also is supporting wi-fi

519
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,200
by the way which made it even easier to

520
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,400
install this back door

521
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
because bluetooth chips and wi-fi chips

522
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,760
are often bundled because

523
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,799
they work in the same 2.4 gigahertz

524
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,160
frequency range from here

525
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
the researchers abused the linux board's

526
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,520
administrative position

527
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,760
within the ivi to reflash the firmware

528
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,840
on a secondary ecu

529
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
the secondary ecu is the one for

530
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
responsible for interaction with the

531
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
vehicle's canvas for those of you who

532
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,440
aren't aware

533
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,919
can bus is a technology used for

534
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,400
internal vehicle communications from one

535
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,880
microcontroller to another it's used to

536
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,919
carry data for

537
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,960
braking steering fuel

538
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,120
monitoring so on and so forth most

539
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
things that go on in the car

540
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,240
are related to canbus somehow but

541
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,039
excuse me the researchers were able to

542
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,880
reflash the firmware on the secondary

543
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,720
device which was necessary

544
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,520
because in its default configuration the

545
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,760
second ecu with access to the can bus

546
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,480
had filters put on it that prohibited it

547
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
from sending arbitrary can messages

548
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,520
this meant that the functionality that

549
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,360
it had regarding the can bus

550
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,120
was very limited but the researchers

551
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,799
wanted to show that they could actually

552
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,760
remove

553
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,640
those limitations by re-flashing its

554
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,720
firmware because they had

555
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,120
remote code execution on the real level

556
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,480
for the linux board

557
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,400
which was kind of the boss within the

558
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
ibi

559
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,960
this was possible due to a lack of

560
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,559
firmware signature checking

561
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,799
on the secondary board had such a

562
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,400
measure been in place even with the

563
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,320
remote exploitation of the main linux

564
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,960
board

565
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,160
there would be no access to the

566
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,799
vehicle's internal networks

567
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,000
following this rewriting of the

568
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,760
vehicle's firmware the researchers were

569
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,679
able to send arbitrary can data

570
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,480
including diagnostic requests this could

571
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,440
in theory

572
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,520
lead to even further exploitation of the

573
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
vehicle

574
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
as they would be able to reprogram other

575
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,840
ecu's through abuse of the diagnostic

576
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,480
functions

577
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
that rabbit hole is an entirely

578
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,840
different conversation however so i

579
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,080
won't be talking too much about

580
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,520
execution of diagnostic based attacks on

581
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,240
a vehicle

582
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,679
in today's lecture but the technical

583
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,320
details

584
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,080
the full technical write-up is not

585
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,240
available as of now

586
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,760
but it is hopefully going to be

587
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,320
available sometime in early 2021.

588
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,679
so the second short case study that i

589
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,960
have prepared for today

590
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
is on some research that was disclosed

591
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
very very recently

592
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,400
so recently in fact that it wasn't

593
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,679
disclosed

594
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,280
until i had already submitted my

595
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,200
application to give this talk so this

596
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,919
kind of got

597
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,360
thrown in last minute but it's

598
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,760
incredibly relevant to bluetooth today

599
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,640
in automotive

600
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,600
and i think it has a lot of merit um for

601
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
for the audience

602
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,679
so this research was performed by and

603
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,880
please part in my

604
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,200
poor pronunciation a gentleman named

605
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
leonard wuters

606
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,080
of k.u luvon university

607
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,360
in belgium he showed how the

608
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,000
bluetooth-based firmware update process

609
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,400
used in tesla model x key fobs

610
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,720
could be abused to eventually lead to

611
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,039
theft of the vehicle

612
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,600
motors found that the model x key fob

613
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,799
right the little

614
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,960
mini model x that they give you to drive

615
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,240
your car

616
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
responds to a signal emitted by the

617
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,280
vehicle's bcm

618
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
which can then lead to a reprogramming

619
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,559
session done

620
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,080
through bluetooth the bcm will

621
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
communicate through bluetooth to the key

622
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,960
fob

623
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,559
and actually send it a new firmware

624
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,640
image that it then

625
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,520
flashes onto itself but the only

626
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,799
authentication

627
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,000
needed from the bcm is derived from the

628
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
vehicle's

629
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,240
vehicle identification number or vin

630
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,120
and the problem is that a vin is

631
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,080
considered

632
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,679
readily accessible information because

633
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,760
you can just go to the car

634
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,039
and look through the windshield and

635
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,120
you'll be able to see the entire vin

636
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,280
and from there you can reverse engineer

637
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,640
the authentication code

638
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
which is very simple and then you have

639
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,039
everything you need to authenticate

640
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,840
with this key

641
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,320
so since there was no code signing

642
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,919
checks done on the firmware updates

643
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,520
pushed to the key fob

644
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,679
this is a common theme in the automotive

645
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,440
industry by the way

646
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
rewriting the firmware to share and

647
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,120
unlock code with the attacker's device

648
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,720
was pretty trivial

649
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,600
what wuters actually did is he bought a

650
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,760
tesla model 3 or sorry model x

651
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,720
bcm online for about what

652
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,159
70.80 i'm not sure exactly how much it

653
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:12,880
cost

654
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,919
and he just programmed it to send this

655
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,000
request to the key

656
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
who would then respond with okay sure

657
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
because he programmed it using

658
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,840
the vin of the vehicle he was targeting

659
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,559
right

660
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,799
so once he got the key to trust his bcm

661
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,480
that he kind of had in this test bench

662
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,679
environment they actually have a picture

663
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,280
of it in the wired article that was

664
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,559
written about this

665
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,000
disclosure he was able to get

666
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,240
this unlock code for the vehicle from

667
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,200
the key

668
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,679
and then use a disassembled model x key

669
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,080
that he had also included in the board

670
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,559
to transmit that signal to unlock the

671
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,879
vehicle

672
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,480
now at this stage the vulnerabilities

673
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,200
he's

674
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,440
kind of exploited have only granted him

675
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,520
access to the inside of the vehicle

676
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,600
but now that he's inside the vehicle he

677
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,480
can do quite a bit more

678
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,320
with access to the can bus which is

679
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,919
readily accessible in the model x you

680
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:10,799
just have to

681
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
pull down a storage compartment it

682
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,840
doesn't even take a full

683
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,080
five minutes he used a different

684
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,960
vulnerability

685
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,799
related to the vehicle's internal

686
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,400
network infrastructure

687
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,000
to actually tell the

688
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,520
car's bcm to pair with his

689
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,120
fake key fob right so it's kind of weird

690
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,440
he

691
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,880
first uses a fake bcm stopped the real

692
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,760
key fob

693
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,240
to get inside the car then he uses the

694
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,679
real bcm

695
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,320
to talk to the fake key fob to recognize

696
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,000
the fake key fob

697
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,039
as being the real key fob right

698
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,799
and so interestingly enough the model x

699
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,039
key fobs do actually contain unique

700
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
cryptographic certificates that should

701
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,159
have prevented

702
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,320
this reprogramming of the bcm from

703
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,760
happening

704
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,640
but even though they existed the bcm

705
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,880
didn't actually check their certificates

706
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,279
so it was kind of a so close yet so far

707
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,799
situation where they had gone like

708
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,640
every step except the last step to

709
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,840
prevent this kind of attack from

710
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,559
happening

711
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,559
but at this stage the attacker has now

712
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,320
broken into the model x vehicle

713
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,240
and has forced the vehicle to recognize

714
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,159
their counterfeit key as its own

715
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,000
giving them all they need to drive off

716
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,080
to the sunset as a confused family

717
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,600
returns ice cream in hand

718
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,279
to an empty parking spot so

719
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,880
everything that was needed to perform

720
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
this attack cost under 300

721
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,159
usd it was like a raspberry pi uh

722
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,559
the bcm key fob that was torn down

723
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,919
and like a battery to keep it all

724
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,360
powered and then he could control it all

725
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
from his phone it was amazing

726
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
the full technical details haven't

727
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,120
really been released yet as well for

728
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,679
this

729
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,679
because it is very fresh research but

730
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,360
tesla has already started patching the

731
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,039
affected vehicles

732
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,799
i feel like excuse me this case study

733
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,400
hopefully illustrates the importance of

734
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,880
assuring that every layer of a system

735
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,720
especially a vehicle's security

736
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,039
is properly configured while the

737
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,200
bluetooth implementation in this case

738
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
wasn't faulty itself it opened the door

739
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,919
to exploitation of the lack of code

740
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
signing present in the system

741
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,200
eventually leading to a full vehicle

742
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,039
theft and maybe more right

743
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,000
hackers are pretty creative this about

744
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,279
summarizes

745
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,240
um the things that i went over today i

746
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,760
just had a couple of lessons

747
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,360
learned that i wanted to kind of share

748
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
some key takeaways

749
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,159
from the different research that i've

750
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,600
read preparing this lecture or talk i

751
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,080
guess

752
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,960
it's not really a lecture but firstly

753
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
bluetooth has the potential

754
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,799
to exacerbate other weaknesses in any

755
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,159
system's architecture

756
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,880
when you add connectivity you add access

757
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,640
every wireless protocol that finds its

758
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
way into a car can be a target for

759
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,080
exploit and no matter what your manager

760
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,200
says

761
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,640
someone will find the vulnerabilities

762
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,480
buried in your code these people

763
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,000
are very very creative

764
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,360
bluetooth itself might not be vulnerable

765
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,640
but this goes hand in hand with the fact

766
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,440
that

767
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,600
code that has vulnerabilities inside it

768
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
even if it's running on an internal

769
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,240
process

770
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,799
can still be exploited through these

771
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,120
pathways into the open

772
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,720
even if the bluetooth implementation is

773
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,880
secure it's possible that other

774
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,279
vulnerable processes that interact with

775
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,799
the information received through

776
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,520
bluetooth

777
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,600
can be targeted when we went over the

778
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,240
ivi crashing and the tesla key fob

779
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,080
examples these are examples where

780
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,520
bluetooth is probably properly

781
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,559
configured

782
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,360
but the processes that parse the data or

783
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,400
handle the data that bluetooth delivered

784
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
were not they were vulnerable these are

785
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,320
great examples of how

786
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,400
everything is connected and security in

787
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,240
depth is definitely necessary

788
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,120
bluetooth is now used more than ever in

789
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,000
vehicles

790
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,240
and it will likely remain a stable short

791
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,080
range connectivity protocol for years to

792
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,880
come

793
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,640
as it becomes tied to increasingly

794
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,919
important and safety critical

795
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,799
applications

796
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,559
the level of scrutiny under which it is

797
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,840
placed needs to be raised accordingly

798
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,799
lastly and not to be grim see what i did

799
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,000
there

800
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,520
but many more undiscovered

801
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,360
vulnerabilities tied to bluetooth likely

802
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,559
exist

803
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,080
and most of the vehicles on the road

804
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,679
today that are running older

805
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,399
often vulnerable bluetooth stacks and

806
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:28,960
unlike

807
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,279
tesla vehicles with their fancy 24 7

808
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,960
back-end connections and over-the-air

809
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,159
updates

810
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,159
these vehicles have close to no hope of

811
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,000
being updated especially five or ten

812
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,240
years into their usage life cycle

813
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,000
these legacy vehicles while not as fancy

814
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,919
and highly connected as modern vehicles

815
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,679
still pose the same threat to public

816
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,039
safety that modern

817
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,840
or connected vehicles do i encourage

818
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,760
anyone interested in automotive security

819
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,520
to more closely consider bluetooth as a

820
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,360
target of interest and i hope that you

821
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,720
all found something

822
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,240
find something new and exciting worth

823
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
publishing responsibly

824
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,039
of course a quick look at the references

825
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,120
that i used in preparing today's

826
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,919
talk um i'll happily provide these

827
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,360
slides to anyone interested

828
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,960
as well you just have to send me an

829
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,039
email and my email listed here

830
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,880
um but i am all out of clever things to

831
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,200
say so thank you so much for listening

832
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,120
and i hope you guys have a great group

833
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,120
on

834
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,600
thanks man that was awesome oh it helps

835
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,799
me helps to be not on me

836
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,760
thank you i was i was afraid my audio

837
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,799
wasn't working i was like

838
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,520
what happened with

839
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,480
yeah so um you mentioned uh people

840
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,440
reaching out to you

841
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,320
uh and uh kf underscore lawless is your

842
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,399
discord user id as well correct

843
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,000
yes that's correct so i'll be answering

844
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,320
questions in discord for the next

845
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,679
15-20 minutes for as long as he's awake

846
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,200
yeah just about just about

847
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,720
um yeah so uh tyler that that sounds

848
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,039
like

849
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,880
a lot of the same kind of story we hear

850
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,399
about attack surface mapping

851
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,080
and how um all we need is one protocol

852
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,039
or one access vector to roll that whole

853
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,720
stack

854
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,039
yeah chaining together those uh those

855
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,480
access vectors and

856
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,559
even having an initial access vector is

857
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,240
half the battle so

858
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
laying those out and then we start to

859
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,279
combine some of that with

860
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,120
the over-the-air updates and some of the

861
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,559
supply chain attacks that we've been

862
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,720
seeing with solar winds

863
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,399
think about what if the solarwinds

864
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,360
attack was a tesla ota attack

865
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,080
now what kind of uh mass zombie car

866
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,120
apocalypse would be

867
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,440
be dealing with today yeah i think on

868
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,399
the bright side

869
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,399
the when it comes to vehicles there's a

870
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,880
lot more genetic diversity

871
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,080
in like vehicular systems because

872
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,640
there's

873
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,760
isn't as like a single ubiquitous you

874
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,960
know like solar winds is pretty

875
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,399
ubiquitous and that's why it was

876
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,919
such a problem but vehicles have this

877
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,679
genetic diversity that's really a

878
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,240
blessing

879
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,640
when it comes to security that means if

880
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,240
you wanted to take over a whole city of

881
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,480
cars you would need to individually

882
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,440
get you know full exploits on every

883
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,000
single type of vehicle in that city

884
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,360
or you're saying not everybody drives

885
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,080
teslas right now

886
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,080
making california silicon valley yeah

887
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,279
there you go

888
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,720
yeah but anyway thank you guys so much

889
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,919
for having me i'm gonna go ahead and

890
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,440
turn my webcam off

891
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,200
and yeah appreciate discord

892
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,520
later

893
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,559
my uh my favorite reference to that is

894
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,720
from uh fate of the furious

895
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,360
the eighth in the uh fast and the

896
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,000
furious

897
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,720
installment where charlize tyrone is on

898
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,440
this

899
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,760
uh wild car chase through i think it's

900
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,039
through new york city and they're going

901
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,240
after vin diesel

902
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,480
and she's like deploy all the o days and

903
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
then they like bring this like tsunami

904
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,799
of

905
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,440
cars of all different types like coming

906
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,919
after them

907
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,120
hollywood hackers oh days with cars huh

908
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,720
that's that's some kinetic kill chain

909
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,880
right there

910
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,799
yeah so i i think i think car security

911
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,159
is interesting um he talked about

912
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,440
genetic diversity

913
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,120
and you see genetic diversity even

914
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,480
within the same model line

915
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,399
um a toyota camry in 2020 is going to

916
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,120
have

917
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,440
different components different software

918
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,679
uh different versions of that software

919
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,519
particularly as you start looking at who

920
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,880
actually has gone in to take their

921
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,240
patches because a lot of these things

922
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,880
are not still

923
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,679
ota just over the years compared to a

924
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,320
2019 or 2018 or 2017

925
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,279
and that's a single bottle line does

926
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:47,519
that

927
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,600
does that cause more problems though

928
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,360
because now now we're talking about

929
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,799
diverse uh and maybe not maintained

930
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,200
uh firmware sets so if there is a an

931
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,559
exploit that exists and one that's

932
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,279
patched on one

933
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,120
maybe that patch does not get applied to

934
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,679
an older version of the firmware or

935
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,240
the ota update is only pushed or

936
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,760
maintained by a certain group that

937
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,640
handles that

938
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,480
and the other groups are maybe not as

939
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,240
secure so that diversity i can see

940
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,440
maintaining those multiple code sets uh

941
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,120
we've seen problems with that before

942
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,600
in different security products right so

943
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,879
it can go kind of both ways

944
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,960
i think car security is i mean we've

945
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,679
already seen this as a big deal

946
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,279
moving forward we've got ics we've got

947
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,760
any any of these

948
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,399
diverse verticals that have capabilities

949
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,919
that can cause kinetic damage

950
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,519
or safety issue or life in life and limb

951
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,000
all of these are now all digitally

952
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,880
connected they're all

953
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,480
running some sort of embedded firmware

954
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,320
they're all going to be running some

955
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,600
architecture they're going to have some

956
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
of the same vulnerabilities

957
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,000
and maybe not even maintained security

958
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,279
wise in the same fashions that our

959
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,559
traditional networks are so i think

960
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,640
we're just getting to the precipice of

961
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,159
where security has to go and is going

962
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,200
uh for these connected devices and now

963
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,080
that it's in

964
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,720
cars and your home when your toaster

965
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,240
start starts talking to your car

966
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,679
letting you know your toast is done and

967
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,840
sends a exploit like that's

968
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,399
you know the next ai and ml uh

969
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,360
apocalypse

970
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,080
is just getting started so i don't know

971
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,519
it's uh it's interesting time to be

972
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,799
alive

973
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,720
it's funny when we uh we first created

974
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
the the concept of the grim toaster

975
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,240
i don't know what was this five years

976
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,159
ago um we

977
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,120
we were looking at ways to make the for

978
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,880
the howdy neighbor exhibit to make it

979
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
even more connected than a lot of things

980
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,480
even were at that time and the idea we

981
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,000
came up with was that

982
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,760
the grim toaster actually has its own

983
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,919
twitter account and it's connected to it

984
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,159
so the apis are linked into the twitter

985
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,279
ins uh to the

986
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,600
the toaster instance and we did that on

987
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,880
purpose because we thought it was funny

988
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,600
it was kind of like an

989
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,200
inside millennial joke that of course

990
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,279
they would want to talk on social media

991
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,559
about their toast

992
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,480
and the reality is now of course that

993
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,320
we're we're not on that precipice

994
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,120
anymore

995
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,240
consumer devices and even devices

996
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,279
embedded or iiot in uh

997
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,599
industrial applications are having

998
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,199
similar feature sheets

999
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,960
feature sets and exposure like that

1000
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,520
yeah and the fact that you're getting

1001
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,639
hard-pressed to find a lot of these

1002
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,280
consumerized products that are not

1003
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
requiring some sort of social media

1004
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,760
account or online cloud presence

1005
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,199
for even use like there's another aspect

1006
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,760
of

1007
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,560
just privacy in general and your

1008
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,760
connected ability of

1009
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,839
all of your devices to you know track

1010
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,040
you maintain

1011
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,440
analytics on you like even outside of

1012
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,000
the the security aspect it is

1013
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
it's getting to be difficult to do

1014
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
anything in any manner

1015
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,639
outside of out of privacy or outside of

1016
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,679
the cloud from

1017
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,040
you know unhooking yourself from all

1018
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,599
these mainstream companies

1019
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,119
i was a little disappointed to learn my

1020
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,520
new oculus requires a very specific

1021
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,880
facebook account

1022
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,280
yep or else it doesn't work it doesn't

1023
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,640
work like

1024
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,839
who would have thought facebook would

1025
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,079
have done something like that

1026
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,000
i hope that was a rhetorical facetious

1027
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,839
question

1028
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,079
because of course they would of course

1029
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,359
they would

1030
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,960
yeah it is uh it is getting to be

1031
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,119
interesting for sure

1032
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,359
what's your uh what's your 2021 threat

1033
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,160
prediction

1034
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,000
right what what's going to happen this

1035
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,400
year that is different than

1036
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
what we've seen i think 2021

1037
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,200
is going to and i think this applied to

1038
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,240
2020 in

1039
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,000
in the same way just we're going to see

1040
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
it in in a different light

1041
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,920
i think we're going to start to see the

1042
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,000
leveraging of

1043
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,320
um consumerized tools and the ability to

1044
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,359
do attribution become much much more

1045
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,800
difficult we've already ran into that

1046
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,320
with a lot of the apt groups with a lot

1047
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,560
of the crimewar groups and ransomware

1048
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,160
but i think there's going to become a

1049
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,079
much bigger diversion

1050
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,560
of these commercialized tools being

1051
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,720
leveraged in sophisticated attacks

1052
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,560
in combination to either provide

1053
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,960
disinformation misinformation

1054
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
in combination with a lot of automation

1055
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,880
so you're going to run into

1056
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,760
a lot of cloud abuse and some some ml

1057
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,440
stuff that's going to correlate

1058
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,200
and be leveraged in these attacks to

1059
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,520
then further propagate ransomware

1060
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,200
or you know whatever else so we're going

1061
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,280
to see a lot of sell-off i think of the

1062
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,079
ransomware

1063
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,680
and access from apt groups to kind of

1064
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,640
throw off the

1065
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,400
disinformation misinformation and i

1066
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
think we're going to have a new strand

1067
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,640
of

1068
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,480
of iot and kind of as we migrate back

1069
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,720
into the enterprise we're going to see a

1070
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,040
lot of enterprise compromise from

1071
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
embedded malware that's been dormant

1072
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,200
sitting because the work at home

1073
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,599
we've seen a whole wave of consumer

1074
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,240
devices

1075
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,079
home routers getting hacked and i think

1076
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,440
that's going to continue as we work from

1077
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,720
home for a while

1078
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,240
but i think as those devices start to

1079
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,320
migrate back into the enterprise

1080
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,440
i think we're going to see that kind of

1081
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,119
second wave of more sophisticated

1082
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,720
attacks that have been laying dorma

1083
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,839
and embedding themselves begin to

1084
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,760
propagate and

1085
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,280
show some of the fruits of of that

1086
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,800
patients

1087
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
so let's let's break that down um first

1088
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,079
the elephant in the room we're talking

1089
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,599
about is cobalt strike

1090
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,040
um we've had source code leaked uh we

1091
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,599
have

1092
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,880
uh forks and derivatives of it um it's a

1093
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,720
it's a powerful tool set which is why

1094
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,640
it's so popular to do that

1095
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,400
um but i i don't know that i would call

1096
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,240
that

1097
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,800
misattribution as much as i would argue

1098
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,119
that that's just the lowest common

1099
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,800
denominator to successfully accomplish

1100
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,400
an operation

1101
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,599
because at the end of the day what code

1102
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,240
gets put

1103
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,720
down i think there are very few people

1104
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,400
on this planet who can confidently

1105
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,160
attribute who they think that is from

1106
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,640
that code for lots of different reasons

1107
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,400
and i think that the the protection of

1108
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,359
attribution

1109
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,280
from an adversary perspective comes

1110
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,200
primarily from

1111
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,640
the c2 slash gray infrastructure

1112
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,920
of how do i command and control it

1113
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,520
i mean blending in right like that's the

1114
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,680
whole point if pen test companies use

1115
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
cobalt strike if

1116
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
you know the other apts use cobalt

1117
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,240
strike why would you not

1118
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,000
maintain and blend in yeah there's

1119
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,280
there's going to be kits that are going

1120
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,000
to be

1121
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,160
leveraging ufei like persistence we've

1122
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,839
already seen some of that

1123
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,240
uh some of the more advanced mechanisms

1124
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,599
but you always at the end of the day

1125
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,520
have to have that channel of

1126
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,960
communication that c2

1127
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,760
and you know something that is modular

1128
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,599
like cobalt strike and is

1129
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,400
not as easily attributed to you know a

1130
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,079
particular actor

1131
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,400
that's when it starts to to to blend in

1132
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,280
and make sense from

1133
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,720
an apt group a crimeware group it

1134
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,000
doesn't matter who you are if you're

1135
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,119
going to be doing it

1136
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,599
why would you not use that so yeah i

1137
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,640
think you're right it's

1138
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,240
definitely getting harder to do

1139
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,320
attribution and honestly

1140
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,880
if you are doing attribution i'll be

1141
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,359
very wary and very careful of how you

1142
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,319
phrase what your attribution is
