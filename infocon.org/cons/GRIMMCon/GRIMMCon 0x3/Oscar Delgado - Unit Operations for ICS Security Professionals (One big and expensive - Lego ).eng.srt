1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,440
good afternoon

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,320
my name is oscar delgado and in the next

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,960
20 25 minutes i would like to talk about

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,400
unit operation

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,520
industrial processes and diagrams and

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,199
why they are important for cyber

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,080
security professionals

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,680
who am i i am a chemical engineer i have

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359
been working in different industries

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,880
including oil and gas

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,800
mining and water and wastewater

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,479
treatment plants in the past

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,440
13 years most of my industrial

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,120
experience is related with oil

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,520
processing plants like refineries

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,480
central processing facilities cpfs and

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,320
petrochemical plants

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,280
so most of the time i work either as

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,600
process engineer or project engineer

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,079
so it means that i was involved with the

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,920
design of the plan itself

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,079
or with the integration of projects

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,760
related with the plan

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,359
i like programming a lot and since 2015

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,520
or so i started diving into cyber

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,119
security

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,159
including pen testing glue and purple

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,040
teaming

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,240
nowadays ics security

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,759
so the plans for today's presentation is

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,320
to talk first about the importance of

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,280
all this

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,520
i want to give you some arguments about

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,040
why you want to spend time

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
studying processes then i will show

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,119
one process to analyze by using unit

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,960
operations

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,520
i will explain unit operations and the

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
associated equipment

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,840
and finally i will talk about process

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,600
diagram

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
why is this important so why on earth do

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
you want to know about you need

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,720
operations

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,320
or the process you have several

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,560
responsibilities

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,040
yet here i am asking you to understand

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
the process why

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
the short answer is communication so the

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,320
management team and the operating team

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
normally don't care about networks

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,680
routers

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,119
historians segmentation etc sometimes

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,959
they don't even care about threats or

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,399
adversaries

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,480
they care about business and the

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
products

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,599
so if you work for a water treatment

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,760
plant your operation teams

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,879
is focused on producing clean water

61
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,080
if you work in a refinery they looked

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,879
on producing fields and that's it and

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,560
you should be able to understand the

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,400
care business and talk with them and

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,280
understanding

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,640
what they are doing and how so

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,280
if you say an attacker might modify the

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,319
plc logic

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,480
that sounds scary but probably is not

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,680
the worst fear

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
but if you tell them that a b or c

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,519
equipment can be disabled

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,599
by the attacker and therefore the

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,360
production will be affected i

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
guarantee they will listen so at this

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,800
point i would like to recommend a talk

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,840
from patrick miller about executive

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,720
communication and risk management he

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
provides a lot of

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
strategies and tools to communicate with

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
your management team

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,800
including of course knowing your

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,599
business and now that you don't need to

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,000
know

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
and understand the intrinsic details

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,200
like okay

87
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,840
the type of catalyst or the density of

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,959
certain fluid

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,360
that's part of the process engineering

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,959
job that is not job

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,800
but should you should be able to

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,599
understand the whole picture

93
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,319
unit operations is the concept i've used

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,599
for this analysis

95
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,840
but you can look for other tools at the

96
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
end the important goal is that you can

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,799
describe

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,640
what the plan does and how

99
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,799
the second answer to this question is to

100
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,280
make

101
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
better decisions and i'm thinking here

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
about priorities

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,239
and risk assessment i remember in the

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:50,640
past

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
a discussion i had about the risk of

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,400
certain transmitters that have

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,360
local diagnostics using web protocols so

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
indeed there was a risk

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,799
but the transmitter in question were

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,200
used for monitoring and almost finished

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,239
product

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
so from the operations point of view any

113
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
issue with those transmitters regardless

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,319
of why

115
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,680
was more a nuance than a risk because

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
they didn't affect the quality

117
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,560
nor the actual inventory so i agree the

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,399
operation team will need to go

119
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,440
and verify other transmitters and maybe

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,680
use manual tools while the situation is

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,639
corrected

122
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
but it's not something that requires

123
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,880
immediate action

124
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,360
we can say that a security professional

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,520
who understand the process will have a

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
better evaluation of risk

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,240
consequences and priorities and probably

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
will have better strategies and better

129
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,840
outcomes with talking with the

130
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,400
operations and the management team

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,240
in the example that we will analyze i

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,560
will give you another case like this

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
i want to use as example the production

134
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,080
of

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
ammonia following the haber polish

136
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
process

137
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,560
i would like to take a menu and look i

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
would like you to take a minute and look

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
at this diagram

140
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
this is a very very simplified diagram

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,800
yet

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,960
i will argue that this is not trivial to

143
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
understand

144
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,600
first of all their unit name that

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
doesn't provide much information about

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
the purpose

147
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
second there are some symbols without

148
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,960
names

149
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,720
that make different difficult to

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
understand like

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,680
every single step in here

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,479
we see some vessels some heat exchangers

153
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:34,960
and the

154
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,600
general material flow but i think it

155
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,000
will be

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,479
difficult for you to explain the process

157
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,320
just with this information

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
and in the next slides we are going to

159
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
change that

160
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
before we can start analyzing the

161
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,479
process we need to understand

162
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,720
unit operations we need to understand

163
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
what are they

164
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
and how they are used so first of all

165
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
they are a concept and this is very

166
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,720
important because that means

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,960
that they are sort of an agreement they

168
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,560
are a convention

169
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
so chemical engineers and process

170
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,360
engineers decide to group operations

171
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,039
based on similarities

172
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,199
and although it makes sense it is

173
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,199
completely arbitrary

174
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,240
now unit operations are just groups of

175
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
operations with similar

176
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
physical principles and common

177
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
techniques that's it

178
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,759
if they behave similar they are in the

179
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,919
same group

180
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,440
the group the number of groups is

181
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
somehow dispute i will show only four

182
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,000
categories but i have seen models with

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
way more

184
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
and you know what that's fine because

185
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,600
the purpose is to understand a process

186
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,960
by using

187
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,239
these building blocks

188
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,800
there is a phrase here that says that

189
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,360
there are

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
thousands of complex processes but a few

191
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
units operation

192
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
right now i would like you to think

193
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
about lego blocks

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,720
you can take just some basic blocks and

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,039
make

196
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,520
thousands of different models same thing

197
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,960
with unit operations

198
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
the only difference is that in

199
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
industrial plan

200
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,240
each block can cost millions of dollars

201
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
and finally in this slide we have two

202
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,280
keywords

203
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,919
that you will find very often driving

204
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,400
force

205
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,440
and equilibrium all processes want to

206
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,840
reach

207
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,080
equilibrium same pressure same

208
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,479
temperature same concentration

209
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,199
this happens naturally if you put hot

210
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,400
water in your kitchen

211
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
you will not after a while it has the

212
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
same temperature of the air

213
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
at the beginning there was a difference

214
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,319
or a driving force

215
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,720
that promoted the change but they

216
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,039
reached thermal equilibrium and they

217
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,440
stayed like that

218
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,400
we as chemical engineers normally profit

219
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
from this and we create the conditions

220
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,599
or the equipment to

221
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,479
expedite the whole process i will

222
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,240
provide for each unit operation the

223
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,280
driving force

224
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
involved and i will give you some

225
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,679
examples of the associated equipment

226
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,160
just to help to understand the concept

227
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,479
of unit operation i would like to use a

228
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,280
simple analogy with cooking

229
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
we know that there are thousands of

230
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,199
different recipes

231
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,599
however professional chefs can probably

232
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,440
produce a successful one

233
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,720
just by relying on their basic skills

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,879
did they study every single recipe in

235
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,720
the world no

236
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,199
they look at basic techniques and master

237
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,080
them

238
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
then they integrate those basic

239
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
techniques as required

240
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,159
of course they can go forward and study

241
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
a type of cuisine and other details

242
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,039
but in general terms i think we all

243
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,640
agree that they use their basic

244
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,519
techniques for a successful recipe

245
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,160
process engineers do exactly the same

246
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,720
they use

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
basic steps and they just integrate them

248
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,279
in different ways to make the unique

249
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,800
product that is required

250
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,000
so you have here the list of unit

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
operations

252
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,839
only four of them i mentioned before

253
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,680
that they are sort of a convention and

254
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
therefore you might find some sources

255
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
with six categories or eight categories

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,480
but at least for me those are the basic

257
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
ones

258
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,160
there are hundreds of thousands of

259
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,320
processes but i guarantee that you will

260
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,640
find

261
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,120
over and over similar equipment and you

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
can use that as an advantage for

263
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
understanding the process

264
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
so instead of looking at the details and

265
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
the specific of each process

266
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
try to look at the big pictures and the

267
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,240
fundamental procs

268
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
what about chemical reactions before you

269
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:39,839
ask

270
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,920
let me tell you that chemical reactions

271
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
are usually not considered as unit

272
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,040
operation

273
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,240
they are very very very important but

274
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,040
they have some

275
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
perks that needs to be addressed

276
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,160
differently

277
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
so unit operation mostly deals with

278
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,839
preparing raw materials

279
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,120
and purifying products in our example

280
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
all chemical reactions will be just

281
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,839
another block

282
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,839
so here we have the initial diagram for

283
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,120
i replace all the reactors with those

284
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
yellow blocks

285
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
i just provide a general description of

286
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,279
what they do so the first one

287
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,079
is intended for hydrogen production and

288
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,920
the second one is for the ammonia

289
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,040
production

290
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,640
there are certain conditions required

291
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,160
for example temperature

292
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,399
but for now we are going to continue our

293
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,480
discussion without looking into those

294
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,959
details

295
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,560
finally our first unit operation

296
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,599
fluid mechanics

297
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,399
this step involves the movement of

298
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
fluids which could be

299
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,279
liquid gas or both simultaneously

300
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,160
when you open your tap to get water

301
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,720
there is

302
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,680
fluid mechanics involved there is a pipe

303
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
there is probably a pump somewhere along

304
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,880
the way

305
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,760
the key concept here is movement and the

306
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
driving force is pressure

307
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,800
difference pressure is normally the

308
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,680
way that we identify this driving force

309
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,800
for example in propane tanks used for

310
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,519
barbecue there is liquid at high

311
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,160
pressure

312
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,440
and when you allow to flow you basically

313
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,160
allow the pressurized fluid to push some

314
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
fluid out

315
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,800
another example could be a syringe um

316
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,760
this is an

317
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,079
interesting one because it has the

318
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,279
negative pressure

319
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,120
of the vacuum that you use for the

320
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,160
suction and then we have the positive

321
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,880
pressure

322
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,200
that we with our thumb that we use for

323
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
the final displacement

324
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,640
i would like to know that every single

325
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
industrial plant regardless of the

326
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,880
product

327
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,279
has at least a few pipelines and

328
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,040
transport fluids from one place to

329
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,240
another

330
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,040
they could be what we know as utilities

331
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
so for example the water

332
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,959
and the industrial layer or they can be

333
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,320
actual materials

334
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,800
but they are present so this step is

335
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,920
very common in

336
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,560
any industry equipment related with

337
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
these steps

338
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,680
piping pumps and compressors

339
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,600
back to our example here we see that

340
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,519
all the blue lines are representing

341
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,800
pipings we also

342
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,600
see a couple of compressors moving gas

343
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,920
and although it's not the

344
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
is not in the diagram we probably have

345
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,360
pumps for

346
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
the liquid water and for the liquid

347
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
ammonia transport

348
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,399
our understanding of this process says

349
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
that we are producing hydrogen

350
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,839
and then we are moving gas through

351
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,760
different steps from the left to the

352
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,160
right

353
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,360
until finally we have the ammonia

354
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,920
not enough to explain the process but we

355
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
are getting there

356
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,600
the second unit operation is heat

357
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
transfer and i believe this is the

358
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
easiest one to understand

359
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,839
we just put in this category and

360
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,920
equipment and involves a temperature

361
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,720
change

362
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,440
either heating or cooling or a phase

363
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,880
change like condensation or evaporation

364
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,600
a little caveat here sometimes there are

365
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
specific names for the equipment based

366
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,240
on

367
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
what they do so all of them are heat

368
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
exchangers technically

369
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,240
but they are referred as re-boiler or

370
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,360
condenser or side conversions or things

371
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,240
like that

372
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,880
the key to understand is all of them

373
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,279
involve a temperature change or a phase

374
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,959
change and the driving force

375
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,959
is the temperature difference between

376
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,760
two materials

377
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,680
in our diagram we have three heat

378
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,720
exchanger

379
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,000
so one is preheating the raw materials

380
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,800
before they enter the reactor the second

381
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
one says energy recovery

382
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
and the last one is for condensing

383
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,079
ammonia

384
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
so far we know that this process

385
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
involves moving raw materials

386
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
and at some specific points we need to

387
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,399
change the temperature of the reactants

388
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,800
or their phase

389
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,720
just a little bit of information the

390
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
ammonia reactions need at a specific

391
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,760
temperature

392
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,440
about 450 c or 840

393
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
f so the first

394
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,440
exchanger the preheater is used to

395
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
breathe the

396
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,600
gas close to the reaction temperature

397
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,760
now after the ammonia reaction is

398
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,279
completed you still have

399
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,519
hot gases coming out of the reactors and

400
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,360
you don't want to lose that energy

401
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
and money because you already pay for

402
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,760
that so what you do is to install a

403
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,199
second heat exchanger

404
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,440
and produces steam while cooling down

405
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,680
some of those materials

406
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,160
finally you condensate the ammonia in

407
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
the last heat exchanger to separate it

408
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,680
from the gas reactor

409
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,000
i would like to make a comment about the

410
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,920
second heat exchanger

411
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,240
it makes totally safe to recover the

412
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,000
energy from the hot gases

413
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,920
as i said you already pay for that

414
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,040
energy

415
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,639
so the next equipment the condenser is

416
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,040
designed based on the output of this

417
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
unit right both of them are

418
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,000
connected however i will say that

419
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,920
depending of the configuration of the

420
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,880
condenser

421
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,839
we might be able to send a different

422
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,720
type of feed

423
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,279
a little bit harder to the condenser and

424
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,519
still recover some ammonia

425
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,560
of course it won't be optimal but it

426
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,920
might be possible

427
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
and in practical terms it means that you

428
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,360
might

429
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,839
accept some issues in the energy

430
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,000
recovery exchanger without stopping the

431
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
whole production

432
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,399
and if you are the defender of this plan

433
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,720
i will argue that this information will

434
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,120
help

435
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,680
a lot when you are assigning priorities

436
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,479
to your assets

437
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,880
so if heat exchanger was the easy one

438
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
this is probably the most difficult to

439
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
understand

440
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
here we are dealing with processes that

441
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,759
involve

442
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,800
moving selected components from one face

443
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,519
to another

444
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,880
or within the same phase the goal is

445
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,240
normally to purify

446
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,360
mixtures i want to take some

447
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,320
specific component because it can affect

448
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,040
production

449
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,600
or because it's dangerous a common

450
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,240
example

451
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,759
h2s small quantities like part per

452
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,639
million can kill you in a few seconds so

453
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,480
normally you wanted to remove it from

454
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,360
the operation as soon as possible

455
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,240
the driving force here is concentration

456
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,680
chemical potential

457
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,199
so we want to move some

458
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,399
stream with high concentration to a

459
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,519
stream with low concentration

460
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,519
regarding the equipment i will say that

461
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,360
almost all towers or

462
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
columns that you will see in a process

463
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
like the distillation

464
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,759
columns of the absorption columns are

465
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,639
part of this group

466
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,279
as i said this is probably the most

467
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,120
difficult concept to understand so i

468
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,959
want to give you some day-to-day

469
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,000
examples of mass

470
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
transfers you're probably familiar with

471
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,199
these cases

472
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,480
but you don't use the term mass transfer

473
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,000
first when we leave the candle or we

474
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,880
cook something we normally can smell the

475
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,839
fragrance

476
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,280
from from a different room so the

477
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,199
the aromas are moving from high

478
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,559
concentrated region

479
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,399
to a less concentrated region

480
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,799
same will happen if you put a few drops

481
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,080
of dyeing water

482
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,799
on when you put sugar in your coffee but

483
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,360
as

484
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,919
instead of stirring you just weigh at

485
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,559
the end

486
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,080
they all reach equilibrium

487
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,679
one interesting example is making sauce

488
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
when you are reducing the sauce you are

489
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,799
actually transferring water from the

490
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,480
sauce from the liquid phase

491
00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:01,440
to the air that's mass transfer as well

492
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,679
there is one particular unit here

493
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,840
related with mass transfer and is the

494
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,799
co2 scrubber what we need to do is to

495
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,799
remove the co2 before

496
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,600
entering the reactor the ammonia reactor

497
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,000
so

498
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
we use water to wash the gas

499
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,559
stream basically we are taking the co2

500
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,400
from the gas phase and put it

501
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
into the water that's all also notice

502
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,799
that the resulting stream is soda water

503
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,480
which is similar to the one that you

504
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,679
drink at a restaurant

505
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,160
solid operations any team that involves

506
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,799
solids is included here

507
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
normally you are interested in size

508
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,640
change and screening

509
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,160
so you can process the solids further

510
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,799
typical equipment here are crushers

511
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,600
grinders

512
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,799
and screens they are not solid

513
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,360
operations in our example so we are just

514
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,840
continue

515
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,080
okay so we started here with this

516
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,559
very simplified diagram and we see a lot

517
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,360
of units

518
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,160
some streams some names but i will argue

519
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
this is not the diagram we want to use

520
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,480
when explaining ammonia production to

521
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,200
someone else

522
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
then we used the concept of unit

523
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,080
operation to understand what was going

524
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,480
on and we ended here

525
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,520
we see that on the left side we have the

526
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,480
raw materials

527
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,520
entering a reactor to produce hydrogen

528
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,720
we see that we produce co2 as well

529
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,440
we want to send all those gases to

530
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,960
another unit that removes

531
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
co2 by using water the remaining gases

532
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,000
the reactants that we call are heated

533
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
before they enter the ammonia reactor

534
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
we produce ammonia and then we recover

535
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,840
energy

536
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,720
from the hot gases finally we separate

537
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
ammonia by condensation

538
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
sending the reactants back to the

539
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,080
reactor

540
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,880
there are three zones in this diagram

541
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,600
first one

542
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,120
is hydrogen production and purification

543
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
it encompasses everything until the

544
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
green block

545
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,600
after that we have the second zone which

546
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,440
is the ammonia production

547
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,520
and the final zone is the ammonia

548
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,080
purification

549
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,760
i will argue at this point that even if

550
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,840
the previous diagram was very simple

551
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,000
this one is way more accessible and

552
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,360
easier to understand

553
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,440
and you know what other people thought

554
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,559
the same

555
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,840
they even gave it the name block flow

556
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,840
diagram or pfd

557
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,280
block flow diagram is probably the first

558
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,120
diagram that you develop as process

559
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
engineer when you are designing or

560
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
studying a new process the idea is to

561
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
use big laws

562
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,799
to show the important steps in the

563
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,000
process

564
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
know that all details are out i don't

565
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
need the type of heaters i don't need

566
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,919
the specifications

567
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,760
i just need to know that there is a

568
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
temperature change or a phase change

569
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,600
after or before certain step

570
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,559
the beauty of this is that the block for

571
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,559
the heater in the ammonia process

572
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,400
could be the same block used to

573
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,640
represent a heater in a refinery

574
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,880
or the same block to represent a heater

575
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,960
in a water treatment plant

576
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,600
our model says that all of them

577
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
represent an operation involving

578
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,400
temperature change

579
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,919
and that's always what we need

580
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,039
again the concept of lego blocks

581
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,760
so those are your blocks those are the

582
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,600
blocks that you want to use

583
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,919
when you are studying or analyzing a

584
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,360
process

585
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,919
no people in ics ask a lot for p ids

586
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,960
sometimes they ask for pfds but in my

587
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,840
experience

588
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,679
they almost never ask for pfds

589
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,320
they are available most of the time even

590
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
if they are not part of the

591
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,799
engineering packages i i can say that

592
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,360
they are normally flying around

593
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,280
bfd are the third type of diagram

594
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,159
used by process engineers and my advice

595
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,080
is that you use them as well

596
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,799
they can help a lot to understand how

597
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,559
things are connected in a complex

598
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,600
process

599
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
there are a few things that i would like

600
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,919
you to take from this talk

601
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,320
number one you should know your business

602
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
it might seem outside your job

603
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,080
description but it's really important

604
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,679
that you understand what you are

605
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,360
protecting as

606
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,080
ics professional you need to understand

607
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,280
the physical part of it

608
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,320
number two complex processes can be

609
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,200
simplified

610
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
by using abstractions and the same

611
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,559
models can work for different process

612
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,559
there are hundreds of thousands of

613
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,679
processes but i

614
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,200
guarantee that you will find over and

615
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,799
over similar equipment

616
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,440
and you can use that advantage for

617
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,120
understanding new process

618
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
so instead of looking at the details and

619
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,159
specific

620
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,919
try to look at the essence and the

621
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,280
fundamental blocks

622
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,640
the big picture number three

623
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,600
you're probably familiar with pfds and

624
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,440
they are very important yes

625
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,080
they provide detailed information about

626
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,960
control loops and process variables

627
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,159
but i suggest that you look at the third

628
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:32,880
diagram

629
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,000
the bfd is not very

630
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,640
used nowadays but it can help a lot for

631
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,919
the understanding and the initial phases

632
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,080
of approaching to a new process

633
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
well thank you very much for your

634
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,600
attention if you have questions or you

635
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,279
want to discuss some things

636
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,480
i will be available on the discord

637
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,159
channel my name is liegantropy

638
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,840
muchas gracias thank you very much and

639
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
cheers
