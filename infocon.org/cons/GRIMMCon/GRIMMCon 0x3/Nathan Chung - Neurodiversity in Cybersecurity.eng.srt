and let this

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,039
video take its place wesley

no let it let it rip all right let the

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,839
games begin

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,400
welcome to grim con 03 my name is nathan

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,199
chung

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,720
today i will be talking about

31
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,040
neurodiversity

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
in cyber security 1997

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,119
apple released a famous ad that went

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
like this

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,000
here's to the crazy ones the misfits

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,960
the rebels the troublemakers the round

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,880
pigs and square holes

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,200
the ones who see things differently

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,960
they're not fond of rules

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
you can quote them disagree with them

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
glorify or vilify them

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
but the only thing you can't do is

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,799
ignore them

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,920
because they change things they push the

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,360
human race board

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,759
and while some may see them as the crazy

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,640
ones

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,759
we see genius because the ones who are

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,040
crazy enough

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
to think they can change the world are

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
the ones who do

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
steve jobs and apple were right

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,479
in fact history is filled with many

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,719
incredible people who are openly

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,320
neurodiverse

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,119
or are suspected or reported to have

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,080
neurodiverse

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,680
traits among them susan boyle

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,680
albert einstein mozart jerry seinfeld

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,920
alan turing richard branson nicola tesla

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
emily dickinson bill gates jessica jin

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
applegate and many many more

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,680
for myself i am actually autistic

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,959
and i have adhd i

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,560
remember my first meltdown i was talking

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,280
to a woman

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,319
who got annoyed that i didn't maintain

68
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,360
eye contact

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,480
and was constantly distracted from that

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
day on i came to realize that i have

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,560
suffered

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,120
from both conditions throughout my long

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,840
career

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,800
in it and cyber security spanning more

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,239
than 20 years

76
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,040
but i didn't know what it meant to be

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
neurodiverse into the past few years

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,360
i am host of the neurosic podcast and

79
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
co-founder of wheesus

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,519
women in cyber security colorado i'm a

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,720
member of the recess

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,000
neurodiversity group and i also serve

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
on three non-profit boards including

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
ignite worldwide reese's colorado and

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,760
spark mindset

86
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,599
today i will briefly cover

87
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,040
neurodiversity

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,159
and will then discuss how neurodiverse

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,280
people

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,080
can help reduce the cyber security

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,720
skills gap

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,080
go over the ideal cyber security jobs

93
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,640
roadblocks and changes that need to be

94
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,879
made

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,400
first what are neurodiverse

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,879
conditions and neurodiversity

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,239
neurodiverse conditions

98
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,920
include not just autism and adhd

99
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,720
but also dyslexia turret syndrome and

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,239
many more

101
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
autism itself is a spectrum so people

102
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,400
can vary

103
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,040
greatly in terms of functionality and

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,640
capability

105
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
neurodiversity is the idea that these

106
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,200
neurological differences

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,720
are natural variations in human genomes

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,600
which reminds me of the x-men cartoons

109
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,079
that

110
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,120
i watched growing up similar to the

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,840
x-men

112
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,720
despite the many famous people in

113
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
history

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
who were and are neurodiverse

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160
there is a negative stigma today

116
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,280
and society often labels neurodiverse

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,160
individuals

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,720
as freaks geeks loners and misfits

119
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
this is often due to the fear of

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
differences in people

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,160
especially in people that do not look or

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,040
act

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
like us people who are neurodiverse

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,160
often have poor social skills reduced

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,680
executive functions

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,320
anxiety meltdowns and sensory overload

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
this gives the perception that

128
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
neurodiverse people are broken

129
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
as a result they often wear masks and

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,280
pretend

131
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,720
be just like everyone else to fit in

132
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,960
similar to software virtualization

133
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,639
pretending to be normal is

134
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
exhausting sadly they are not

135
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
free to be themselves and they have a

136
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,759
harder

137
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
harder time living and thriving in

138
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,479
today's world

139
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,280
on the flip side this highlights an

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,360
unspoken truth

141
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
that neural diverse conditions are

142
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,400
invisible

143
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
and you cannot easily identify a

144
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
neurodiverse person

145
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
even though many work in technology and

146
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,840
cyber security

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,479
this is a tragedy because many

148
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,840
neurodiverse people

149
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,800
have skills and capabilities that make

150
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,120
them

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,560
ideal to work in cyber security

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,199
which currently has a severe shortage of

153
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,280
workers

154
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,319
being able to hyper focus is great for

155
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,479
reverse engineering malware

156
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,600
performing repetitive tasks

157
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,360
is great for parsing through security

158
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
logs

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,520
being process oriented helps when

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,680
responding to incidents

161
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
where a failure to follow incident

162
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
response

163
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,440
processes and procedures such as chain

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,400
of custody

165
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,639
can make the difference between a

166
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,280
successful prosecution of a suspect

167
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
or letting them go free the ability to

168
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,919
find a needle in the haystack

169
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,479
is great for hunting security threats in

170
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,919
a network

171
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,759
out-of-the-box thinking is great for

172
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,600
writing scripts which

173
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
is a key cyber skill today or automation

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
being highly creative helps when

175
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,599
attacking networks

176
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,400
inversely having a strong attention to

177
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,120
detail

178
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,840
is great for defending networks against

179
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,400
attacks

180
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
their specialized abilities make

181
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,680
neurodiverse people great candidates for

182
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,639
many technical

183
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,240
cybersecurity jobs such as

184
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,360
threat hunter forensics analyst incident

185
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
response

186
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,280
malware engineer pen tester and many

187
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
more

188
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
inversely non-technical jobs are

189
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
tend to be less ideal such as security

190
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
project manager

191
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,960
privacy officer security auditor

192
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
or compliance and risk manager cyber

193
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
security jobs have

194
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,479
already been proven to be a great fit

195
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,240
for neurodiverse people

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,680
for example unit 9900

197
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,199
of israel's defense forces hires

198
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
many dozens of people who are

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
on autism spectrum due to their visual

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,639
thinking

201
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,919
and detailed analytical capabilities

202
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,160
this is also a potential national

203
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
security issue

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,479
similar to israel other countries around

205
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,039
the world

206
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,599
are finding and poaching top cyber

207
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,120
security talent

208
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,360
if u.s companies do not hire

209
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
neurodiverse workers

210
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,240
for cyber security jobs our enemies

211
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,599
and friends will

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,680
neurodiversity can also be the key to

213
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,120
recruit more women in cyber security

214
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,919
many women today have neuro diverse

215
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,120
conditions

216
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
such as autism and adhd but they often

217
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,559
go

218
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,599
undiagnosed this is also a tragedy

219
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,320
since women with such conditions are not

220
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
aware

221
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,360
that cyber security is not for men only

222
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,560
i myself know a great many women working

223
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
in cyber security

224
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,600
throughout the world who are just as

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
good as men

226
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,880
if not better in a sign of progress

227
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
compared to when i was growing up

228
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
neurodiverse conditions

229
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,279
can now be identified in girls at a

230
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,959
younger age

231
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,200
instead of feeling confused and

232
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
negatively labeled

233
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,560
imagine if people show them how special

234
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,440
and amazing they

235
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
are also that a career in cyber security

236
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,880
is a possible career field for them

237
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,959
i myself advocate for that girls and

238
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,160
young women

239
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
need to be supported because they

240
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
will become the future cyber security

241
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,959
workers and leaders of tomorrow

242
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,399
now the roadblocks first despite the

243
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,600
many advantages

244
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,920
that neurodiverse workers can bring to

245
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
cyber security

246
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,800
roblox exists that can be best described

247
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,080
as trying to fit a square peg into a

248
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
round hole

249
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,560
at many companies having a disability is

250
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:58,959
still

251
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,240
seen as a problem because

252
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
they evaluate workers based on

253
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,079
output similar to a factory where every

254
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,640
worker

255
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,959
is expected to be productive and problem

256
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,240
free

257
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,320
when a neurodiverse person requests

258
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
accommodations

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,399
people and companies see the increased

260
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,120
costs

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,440
and changes as burdens i have heard

262
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
too many stories where companies prefer

263
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,600
to terminate or eliminate nor diverse

264
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
workers

265
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,279
corporate culture needs to change

266
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,959
second typical career paths in cyber

267
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,160
security

268
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,880
are not optimized to meet the needs of

269
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
neurodiverse workers

270
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
typically workers often start at entry

271
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,880
level

272
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,160
progress to mid-level get promoted to

273
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,200
manager

274
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,640
and then go on into executive management

275
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,079
problem that problem what if a

276
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,200
person does not want to be a manager

277
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,360
social interactions are where many

278
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,560
neurodiverse people

279
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,240
struggle also with also many

280
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,360
neurodiverse workers will prefer to stay

281
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,079
in a technical

282
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,680
position the typical career path

283
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,959
have and will continue to fail them

284
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,279
to make matters worse changing job

285
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,160
descriptions

286
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,600
and career paths are often very hard to

287
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,399
do

288
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,160
especially with older legacy hr systems

289
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
that are often difficult to reconfigure

290
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,760
since many companies retain such legacy

291
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,120
hr systems

292
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
due to the high cost of replacing them

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,240
change

294
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,760
is almost impossible in my experience

295
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
companies will often choose

296
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,959
not to change settings in legacy systems

297
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,760
and just

298
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,880
hope that the system doesn't break

299
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,160
even more difficult are job descriptions

300
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
and career paths for government

301
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,639
positions

302
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,240
when i started my first full-time i.t

303
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,279
position working at honolulu police

304
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,079
department in

305
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,120
hawaii they still use ancient

306
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
technology terms in their job

307
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
descriptions such as

308
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,000
micro computer the term microcomputer

309
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
was popular

310
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,240
back in the 1970s and 80s

311
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,279
unfortunately many years later not much

312
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,040
has changed

313
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,760
this is part of a job description for a

314
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,120
government position

315
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
today why are these ancient terms

316
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
still used often because

317
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,600
in federal state and local governments

318
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
changing the job descriptions and career

319
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
paths

320
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,279
would typically require legislative

321
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,040
changes

322
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,639
one example i remember was how one city

323
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,200
government

324
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,320
handled a broken hp laserjet

325
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,839
2 printer legislation provided

326
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,360
extensive funding for printer repair

327
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,279
and less funding for printer replacement

328
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,680
so instead of spending less money to

329
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,079
replace the printer

330
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,440
they are forced to repair it

331
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
add to that of a state is heavily

332
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,279
unionized

333
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,639
it is even harder to pass legislation to

334
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,600
make these changes

335
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,560
in a job early in my career i was part

336
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,360
of a team

337
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,079
that attempted to negotiate with the

338
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,360
unions to make

339
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
changes to labor laws so that a

340
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,120
technical person

341
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,920
could advance their career stay

342
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
technical and not become a manager

343
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,399
the unions would not budge

344
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,600
worse yet promotions are oftentimes

345
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
harder for people who are neurodiverse

346
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,320
i remember an episode from an apple

347
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
tv series for all mankind

348
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,760
where abbas explained you are not

349
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
what is called a team player you have

350
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,480
many strengths

351
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,959
intelligence intuition cunning

352
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,639
determination

353
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,360
nonetheless now you have seniority

354
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,399
experience

355
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,760
impeccable credentials so why

356
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,040
were you passed over for promotion

357
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,240
it is because you do not play the game

358
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,040
you resist forming the social bonds

359
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,160
necessary

360
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,279
to be seen as a team member

361
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,519
therefore you are not and will never

362
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,360
will be seen as a team

363
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,120
leader this one dialogue shows how

364
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,320
important it is to be social in order to

365
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,519
advance

366
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,279
this is perhaps one of the biggest

367
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
roadblocks

368
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,279
consider who would be most favorable for

369
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,199
promotion

370
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,320
mr x who is neurodiverse

371
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,040
he generates tons of productivity and

372
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
often struggles

373
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,079
at social events such as happy hours or

374
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,279
mr y who is not neurodiverse

375
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
he is the life of the party at happy

376
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
hours and

377
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,680
has tons of friends in the office in my

378
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,560
experience

379
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,160
mr y will always win out especially for

380
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,880
promotion into management roles

381
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,920
this is because he

382
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,639
can develop the social relationships to

383
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,440
build trust

384
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,639
and navigate office politics in my long

385
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,160
history working in iit

386
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,519
and cyber security workplaces will often

387
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,240
systematically unconsciously and

388
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,959
naturally

389
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,240
promote in this manner i myself

390
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,920
experienced this

391
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,240
drinking at happy hours is one of the

392
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,720
most common group activities

393
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
along with golf and sports events when a

394
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,320
person

395
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,360
refuses to attend as many who are

396
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,920
neurodiverse may often choose

397
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,560
it sends the message that you are not a

398
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,839
team player

399
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,560
you are anti-social and definitely not

400
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,639
worthy of promotion

401
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,079
this effectively and unfairly

402
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,120
shuts out many neurodiverse people

403
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,800
for promotion into higher level

404
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,359
positions

405
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,000
so what can be done to remove these

406
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
roadblocks

407
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,040
first let's start with interviews

408
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
some companies interview with a panel

409
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,480
with large

410
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,120
number of interviewers for some

411
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,079
neurodiverse interviewees

412
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,120
this can be very intimidating

413
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,000
one solution limit the number of

414
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
interviewers to just

415
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,720
one person in addition

416
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,680
the traditional interview is a social

417
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,320
ritual

418
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,199
with lots of questions so a neurodiverse

419
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,320
interviewee

420
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,399
will struggle instead allow them to show

421
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,720
and demonstrate the skills required for

422
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
the position

423
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,119
one example is whiteboarding to show how

424
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,160
the interviewee

425
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,280
would solve a problem in short

426
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,400
give them the opportunity to shine

427
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
second corporate cultures need to change

428
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,799
a person who is neurodiverse should not

429
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,880
be labeled as being broken

430
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,319
or disabled strengths and abilities

431
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,760
should be identified just

432
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,679
like everyone else tools should be right

433
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,120
tools should be provided as needed

434
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,480
managers need to be trained to manage

435
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,520
neurodiverse workers with patients and

436
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,799
empathy

437
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,000
and not rely on typical social styles

438
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
and management methods that hinder

439
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,039
neurodiverse

440
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,559
workers third

441
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,640
career paths where cyber security

442
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,039
workers need to change

443
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,320
career paths need to be changed to allow

444
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,480
workers to stay in technical roles but

445
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,320
still advance

446
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,440
eliminate the bias of staying in a

447
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,200
technical position

448
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,840
eliminate requirements that force

449
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,080
workers into positions where they cannot

450
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,840
thrive

451
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,360
do the hard work to make the changes

452
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,120
upgrade hr systems and if necessary pass

453
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
applicable legislation or policies

454
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
essentially

455
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,640
get it done finally workplaces need to

456
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:32,960
go

457
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,000
all in there are many companies that

458
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
have neurodiversity

459
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,280
hiring programs the flaw is that the

460
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,160
changes made

461
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,400
affect only a small part of the

462
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,919
organization

463
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,080
without creating necessarily

464
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,600
without creating necessarily making

465
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,120
lasting changes

466
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,159
to affect the whole

467
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,360
companies need to go all in so that the

468
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,160
change so that the changes have real

469
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,120
impact

470
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,320
to ultimately respect the differences

471
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,840
strengths and weaknesses of not just

472
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,280
neurodiverse workers

473
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,559
but all people

amazing people in cyber security who are

480
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,480
neurodiverse

481
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,120
and thank you for to nerocon for this

482

different perspectives help us all

501
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,400
different

502
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,960
like if you think of neurodiverse as

503
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,760
being kind of

504
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,240
the edge of a bell curve right here

505
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,640
impromptu bell curve come on yeah it

506
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,280
is it's great this is at least being

507
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,960
brought up in the topic and everything

508
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,559
this this is awesome because this i feel

509
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:50,960
like

510
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
this is something to be more talked

511
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,559
about um

512
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,440
with like hr um as well as management he

513
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,960
mentioned that you know management

514
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,760
and finding great talent and everything

515
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,559
find it like

516
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,400
who are those like top performers you

517
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,080
know they're not all they always score

518
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,400
higher

519
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,240
tests and everything like that or may

520
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,559
not score high on uh

521
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,440
um just good things that you think they

522
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,039
are but they're very high performing in

523
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,480
certain areas and you know that's pretty

524
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,760
much most of cyber security you know

525
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
some people are very high performing in

526
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,320
very certain areas you know um so you

527
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,640
know

528
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,039
bell curve right distribution across say

529
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,760
here's

530
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,840
normal in the exact middle but nobody's

531
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,039
exactly

532
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,600
100 to that exact line they are normal

533
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,520
and plus there's not just one dimension

534
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,039
of existence so

535
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,400
across each bell curve if you will of

536
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,559
attributes you're going to be somewhere

537
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,400
fairly randomly along that line

538
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
and or along that curve i should say and

539
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,559
on average you're going to have a lot of

540
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,600
things that you're

541
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
closer to the center of the bell curve

542
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,520
but not everything pretty much by

543
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
definition

544
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
if you roll enough dice you're not going

545
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,080
to get threes and fours all the time

546
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,679
you're going to get some ones and sixes

547
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,080
or

548
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
if you uh we're all enough stats and

549
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,360
dungeons and dragons

550
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
you're not always going to be you know

551
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
uh 10 11

552
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,400
12. sometimes you're going to have some

553
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,440
threes sometimes you're going to have

554
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
some 18s you're going to be

555
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
further along the bell curve that is

556
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,640
inevitable that is not

557
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,080
wrong by any means it is just a state of

558
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,400
reality and to try to exclude

559
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,880
people because they don't happen to be

560
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,039
in the center of the bell curve along

561
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,120
some axis that you happen to care about

562
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,840
you're excluding so many people with uh

563
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,640
such

564
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
such great useful insights for you that

565
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,159
that

566
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,600
saddens me to think of uh so just wanted

567
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,000
to speak to that and that whole talk was

568
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
amazing i'm

569
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,320
very happy that nathan was able to join

570
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,320
for grim khan to share that with us
