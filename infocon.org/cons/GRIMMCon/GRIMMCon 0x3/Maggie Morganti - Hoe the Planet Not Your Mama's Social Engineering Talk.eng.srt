00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,760

hoe has high voltage in there somewhere

96

high voltage output something

97
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,319
yeah you can really amp this up that's

98
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,359
what it's all about

99
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
what was that oh man that's what this is

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,519
all about

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,640
ha ha

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
for those of you who are not familiar

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,080

actually a dad yeah it's true it's very

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
true

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,799
you know why uh why pelicans are always

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,480
optimistic

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,639
because it's either black or white

111
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,680
because if they weren't they'd be

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,400
pelicans

113

she's walking right by the stage i mean

175
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,520
i don't know why the parents would bring

176
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
them right by the stand-up comedian

177
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,240
stage like they could have gone to the

178
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,720
back of the room

179
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800

in and tuning in and miss some of that

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,440
intro

185
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,280
my name is maggie morganti a lot of you

186
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,960
guys know me by mags

187
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,000
and uh we're going to do a pg-13 talk

188
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,759
today called hoe the planet not your

189
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,160
mama's social engineering talk

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,080
and so a little bit about me i have a

191
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,800
master's degree in intelligence studies

192
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,479
from mercyhurst university back in

193
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,960
pennsylvania and when i was doing my

194
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,680
degree there

195
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,240
i interned at fire eye on their cyber

196
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
threat intelligence team

197
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,879
i always like to give a shout out to

198
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,120
fireeye because they tolerated my bad

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,800
jokes enough to actually stretch my

200
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
internship out

201
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,759
um from what was supposed to be three

202
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,199
months to eight months so you know i

203
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,879
always really appreciate that experience

204
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,160
and love to give them a shout out for

205
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
that

206
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,520
and after that internship completed i

207
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,280
took a full-time job

208
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,520
a few years back at oak ridge national

209
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
laboratory

210
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,319
that you know let me get into a bunch of

211
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,840
different kinds of cool research both

212
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,520
cyber related and not

213
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
but kind of the main thrust of what i've

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
been working on here

215
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
has been grid security research and

216
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,479
most recently a super sweet colleague of

217
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,080
mine megan samford

218
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,240
uh gave me a call a few months ago back

219
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,080
i guess now and basically said hey you

220
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
know i got this vp

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,159
uh position at schneider electric and

222
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
i'm building out a team you know why

223
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,880
don't you come work with me

224
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
and that was really a position that i

225
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,320
couldn't pass up

226
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,680
so i'm actually headed there now in 2021

227
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,839
i'm pretty excited about that to work as

228
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,600
a product security researcher for

229
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
schneider

230
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
focusing a little bit on their energy

231
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,839
management side

232
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,360
um pretty in line with what i've been

233
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,519
doing and for any of you guys that don't

234
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,160
follow me on twitter i do have a twitter

235
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
account i've included the my handle

236
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
there

237
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,080
so my dms are generally open unless

238
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,519
someone gives me a reason for them to

239
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,720
not be open

240
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
so if you guys have any questions

241
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
regarding this or um

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,160
ics stuff you know always feel free to

243
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,040
ping me

244
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,880
i'm always you know super happy to talk

245
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
about that stuff

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,200
and then um i kind of had to make this

247
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
joke i'm actually giving this talk right

248
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,760
now

249
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,560
i'm not sure if you guys can see from my

250
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,040
office here at oakridge national lab

251
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
and this is my my last day at work here

252
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,920
before i go on to work at schneider and

253
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,279
i thought that that was super fitting

254
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,800
considering this may have been my last

255
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,399
day at work here anyways

256
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,399
um has a guppy giving a talk with the

257
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,800
word hoe in the title i'm not sure my

258
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
lab director excuse me would have loved

259
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,040
that too much

260
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,360
and in addition to this being a uh a

261
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,040
pg-13 talk

262
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
i did want to do a disclaimer for any of

263
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,279
you guys that read the abstract of this

264
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,240
that this is not

265
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
sort of any you know morally judgey high

266
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
horse talk you know we're not gonna be

267
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
uh you know condemning any of the you

268
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,680
know the good floozies or boys out

269
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,880
there of the world

270
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,560
uh what we are you know again i come

271
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
from a research background

272
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
going to be you know studying them and

273
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,760
observing their habits

274
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
uh you know for the purpose of looking

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,839
at this from a privacy standpoint

276
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,480
and from a social engineering standpoint

277
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
um kind of as it relates to us

278
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
as a community and so any of you who

279
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,399
look at my background

280
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,959
can see that it's pretty heavy in the

281
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,920
ics operational technology space

282
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,079
and you may be wondering uh hey max you

283
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,519
know what are you doing giving a social

284
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
engineering talk

285
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,120
you know let alone kind of a uh a pg-13

286
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
social engineering talk and that's a

287
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,880
very valid question

288
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,079
so a few years back i found myself

289
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
in a new city at a new job single for

290
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,120
the first time

291
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,760
since i owned a flip phone and you can

292
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,200
all make fun of me for how old that

293
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
makes me

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,040
i'm aware of it and uh you know kind of

295
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,959
despite all of the horrible anecdotes

296
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,320
that i'd heard from friends about you

297
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,040
know

298
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,240
trash fire that is dating apps i

299
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
went ahead and you know had some wine

300
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,600
and sat down

301
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,040
in the living room with a few of my

302
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
girlfriends and got on a few of these

303
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,560
apps thinking you know oh this is going

304
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
to be so much fun

305
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,519
you know we have the lab here we have

306
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,920
the smoky mountains here we have ut here

307
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,000
you know there should be a ton of really

308
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,839
you know wonderful people in this new

309
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,120
town for me to meet

310
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,480
and um by the fact that i'm giving this

311
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
talk you can probably imagine that that

312
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
didn't exactly go

313
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,680
how i envisioned it and so i wouldn't be

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
someone with an intel background

315
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
if i didn't give you the key takeaways

316
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,040
of this talk first for why we're doing

317
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
it so the first one is

318
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,519
i think sometimes as a community we tend

319
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
to think of social engineering

320
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,320
as a discipline that requires you know a

321
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,160
lot of formal training

322
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,720
and courses and you know even like

323
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,480
apprenticeship sort of things

324
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
when really social engineering is just

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,600
um

326
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,519
emotionally manipulating someone to get

327
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,880
a result you want

328
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
and that's human nature i mean that

329
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,920
happens

330
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,760
all the time in the majority of

331
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,200
interactions we have whether it's

332
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,279
nefarious or whether it's not

333
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,440
so i really wanted to just kind of raise

334
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
a little bit of awareness to this

335
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
because i think sometimes

336
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,959
we get in this siloed thinking that

337
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,320
social engineering is

338
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,800
just kind of a professional discipline

339
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,240
when really it's not

340
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
and the second is looking at this from

341
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
the privacy standpoint

342
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
of when people do things to try to hide

343
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
their behavior that often leads to that

344
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,200
data

345
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
being significantly less safe and when

346
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,480
it is

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,320
you know highly sensitive data like

348
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,760
something that could make you

349
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,720
compromised

350
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,519
or sensitive pictures if that data is

351
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,120
not being stored in a way

352
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
that is secure and safe um

353
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
things that you're putting out into the

354
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,839
world might end up in places you really

355
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,440
don't want them to

356
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,160
and lastly social engineers can be

357
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,519
social engineered

358
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,680
um you know we we see it time and time

359
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
again that people that do have

360
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,399
you know formal security backgrounds um

361
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,839
whether that be

362
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
uh in the private sector or people

363
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
coming from the intelligence community

364
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
with you know extensive experience and

365
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,040
this still fall prey to it themselves

366
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,959
and you know whether for good or for ill

367
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,079
we are very much

368
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,600
kind of a a whole of life community

369
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
you know in addition to supply chain

370
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,959
village and car hacking village and all

371
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,480
of those other great

372
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,920
uh nonprofits we we have you know mental

373
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,040
health village

374
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,279
and all of the red team blue team deeper

375
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
fits and our own cooking shows

376
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
and this community really likes to you

377
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
know kind of embrace the total

378
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,480
of our lives together to you know make

379
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,800
them better and help our help each other

380
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,639
um you know stay more safe and stay more

381
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,320
secure so i thought it would be really

382
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
fun to give a talk

383
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
on the social engineering aspects you

384
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
know not of

385
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,600
you know your mom helping you break into

386
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,120
a jail for an engagement

387
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
or you know breaking into a bank but

388
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,560
more the actual day-to-day personal

389
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,720
interactions that a lot of us have

390
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,519
outside of work and so the first one of

391
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,000
these

392
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
is realizing that your everyday people

393
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,399
who haven't taken any of our conference

394
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,000
trainings who haven't gone through the

395
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,519
intelligence community

396
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
can still be really and i mean scarily

397
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,920
good at this

398
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,839
you know you don't have to pay 3 700

399
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,680
at you know your local hacking

400
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,199
conference to learn how to social

401
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,399
engineer i mean there are

402
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,079
you know layman people walking around

403
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,639
who are just absolutely excellent at

404
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,519
this

405
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,959
so you know not kind of getting into

406
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,880
that mindset of you know oh this is just

407
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,399
an everyday person

408
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,880
you know they probably aren't you know

409
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,519
doing anything deceitful

410
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,040
and uh one of my really sweet

411
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,279
girlfriends uh likes to

412
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,199
uh refer to people that you know kind of

413
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,959
had this sort of behavior

414
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,279
as tinder lizards and i picked that up

415
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,600
it's not my original content

416
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,880
but i just thought it was hilarious and

417
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
kind of had a nice snap to it and

418
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,440
you know really helps kind of visualize

419
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,399
this kind of like

420
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,360
scaly slimy behavior that we you know

421
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,760
kind of

422
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
typically associate with that like

423
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
caricature of a person's behavior

424
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,440
um so i made a fun uh animal profile for

425
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,480
you know this for the sake of the

426
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,800
presentation and i think the piece to

427
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,399
really pull out here

428
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,680
is that these people who you know

429
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,000
you may find out down the road are you

430
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,240
know actually fairly deceitful

431
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
probably aren't going to come across

432
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
that way to you at first i mean if

433
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,720
they did this wouldn't be social

434
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,880
engineering if you could spot a slime

435
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
ball from a mile away you'd never

436
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,880
fall for it so a lot of times this

437
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,079
behavior is

438
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,600
wrapped in very you know kind of

439
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
innocent innocuous

440
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,560
um other behaviors that you know

441
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,279
lead you to you know have trust in

442
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,000
someone

443
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,199
and not uh suspect certain things

444
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,560
so the way that we're going to go about

445
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
doing this and this is the part of this

446
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,759
that may or may not get me in trouble

447
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,639
but it's fine um is i thought a really

448
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,759
fun way to

449
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
present this would essentially be uh

450
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,639
doing an exercise where essentially i'm

451
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,560
going to role play

452
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
you know your typical skeevy tinder

453
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,920
lizard and walk

454
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,759
through some of these behaviors that

455
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,279
they use kind of especially in the

456
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,120
digital sphere

457
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,079
and ways that would affect us from an

458
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,759
infosec standpoint

459
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,160
and look at some of the problems that

460
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,920
you know i would run into if i was this

461
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,040
kind of person

462
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,720
and some of the really creative

463
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
solutions um you know that i have a

464
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,079
researcher have found you know

465
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,160
their personal experience or friends

466
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,480
anecdotes or reddit or podcasts

467
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,000
anecdotes

468
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,040
of kind of people uh things that people

469
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,639
have found partners were doing

470
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,399
that you know we would be mad about it

471
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,040
if it wasn't just like so damn creative

472
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
um so we're gonna go through some of

473
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
this together and you know instead of

474
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,759
kind of pointing the finger

475
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,680
to like you know this is how they would

476
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,519
do that you know do it in a very judgy

477
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,800
way i thought it would be really fun to

478
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,639
actually assume that role

479
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,480
and walk you guys through some of this

480
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
so for the next probably about 10

481
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,120
minutes

482
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,199
um i'm going to be role playing liz the

483
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,919
tinder lizard as your guide through

484
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,640
uh how a you know kind of skeevy tinder

485
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,599
lizard

486
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,240
would uh use kind of their the digital

487
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,359
tech at their disposal

488
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,919
and social engineering tactics um to

489
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,760
kind of get away with some things that

490
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,240
we wouldn't traditionally

491
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
you know want to see in behavior so

492
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,280
uh beginning of our journey you know

493
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
just kind of set the stage

494
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,919
for the purpose of this my character is

495
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,080
going to be liz the tinder lizard

496
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,559
and you know i'm a you know 20 something

497
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,440
year old girl

498
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,520
who you know has two or three guys that

499
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,960
aren't aware of each aren't aware of

500
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,200
each other that i'm talking to

501
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,480
and you know i still kind of want to

502
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,240
play the field a little bit

503
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,520
i'm not quite ready to give that up

504
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
so i would still like to be on these

505
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,720
dating apps kind of without any of those

506
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,640
men who also aren't aware of each other

507
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,360
knowing

508
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,000
so there's a few ways that i can do this

509
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,720
the first

510
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,799
is going to be constantly deleting the

511
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,240
app so that if i'm sitting here

512
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
scrolling through my phone you don't see

513
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
thumbnails for bumble

514
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
hinge tinder or any of the other million

515
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,520
of these that there are

516
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
but that's pretty thin as far as you

517
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,280
know kind of a

518
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,160
tinder lizard ttp because you know

519
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,679
people have friends that are on these

520
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,240
apps

521
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,600
and you know if my profile card or

522
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
whatever is still coming up

523
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
in a geographical area that you know

524
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,799
that person has friends in

525
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,880
they're going to say hey you know so and

526
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,559
so is still on these apps you know i

527
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,919
thought you guys were hanging out so

528
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,039
that's a pretty thin

529
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,520
rookie way to go about this the second

530
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,679
one is going to be you know kind of your

531
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,760
traditional cliche hoes in different

532
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,039
area codes

533
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,520
so say i you know know that i have

534
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
family that's about you know an hour or

535
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,000
two away

536
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
or that i travel across the country for

537
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,080
business a bunch

538
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,200
a lot of these apps will allow you to

539
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
uh set your location in a different spot

540
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,480
we saw this

541
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,640
uh that people were using it to actually

542
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,320
collect intel during the initial

543
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,520
initial uh covet outbreaks but you know

544
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
if i'm gonna be skeevy

545
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
you know maybe i'm gonna set my location

546
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,559
for somewhere that

547
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,080
you know the people that i'm hanging out

548
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,520
with wouldn't be matching with me

549
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,320
because

550
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,240
as far as this app is concerned you know

551
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,440
i'm not in

552
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,919
knoxville tennessee i may be you know in

553
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,880
atlanta or seattle or somewhere else

554
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
but again you know the geographic

555
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,000
constraints of that you know the

556
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,280
logistics are

557
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,880
not convenient you know then i actually

558
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,559
have to go to these places to meet those

559
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,440
people

560
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,520
so then we have you know kind of true

561
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,000
experts you know people like nathan here

562
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,919
with the you know the duck and the taco

563
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,559
mask to kind of mask your identity

564
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,640
or uh some of the other really fun

565
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,840
things that i could do

566
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,400
are adjusting what i tell the app that i

567
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,760
want to be matched with

568
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,200
so say i you know by current kind of

569
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,679
flaw

570
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,240
consists of you know men that are

571
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,720
generally you know 23 to 28

572
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
and you know they might all be short and

573
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,960
they may be

574
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,200
you know not particularly religious and

575
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
very politically progressive

576
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,039
and i've matched with them because the

577
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,559
app determined that's both

578
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,400
uh what we both want and it showed us

579
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,240
each other but if i

580
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,679
all of a sudden tell the app you know

581
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,760
hey i think i want some diversity in my

582
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,440
life i really want

583
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,400
um you know a tall over 45 very

584
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,799
religious very republican kind of q anon

585
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,159
sort of figure

586
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,799
um while that may or may not actually be

587
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,240
what i want

588
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,720
all of a sudden if my parameters change

589
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,600
for what the app

590
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,159
thinks i want to be matched with um

591
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,520
everyone that i've

592
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,440
previously matched with kind of won't be

593
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
able to see me anymore in their card

594
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,600
deck if i unmatch from them because

595
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,520
the algorithms won't think that we're

596
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,720
going to you know be a good fit

597
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,400
and then once i find someone that i

598
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,760
would like to talk to then we have a

599
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,360
whole other set of problems

600
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,000
that i actually have to talk to them in

601
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,360
a way that's not

602
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
you know suspicious to any other person

603
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,280
that i'm talking to that may or may not

604
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,960
be shoulder surfing me

605
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,640
and you know we can't talk about this

606
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,240
without just raising a glass

607
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,880
to you know the wonderful david petraeus

608
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,480
who really just brought

609
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
all of this you know kind of crashing

610
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
into the dod space

611
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,640
uh with his very public affair with his

612
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,159
biographer which we'll get into in a

613
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,039
second

614
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,320
uh so the kind of very common

615
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,080
um you know lizard ttp that happens

616
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,520
is uh the duplicate friend so say i have

617
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,840
a very sweet friend here in knoxville

618
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,520
caitlyn grace

619
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
most phones will allow you to have two

620
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,640
people with the same name

621
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,240
in your phone so the really easy thing

622
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,799
to do

623
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,760
is say i'm hanging out with johnny um

624
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,840
but i know that jimmy may be texting me

625
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,360
i'm just going to change jimmy's name in

626
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,159
my phone

627
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,559
to caitlyn grace and that way when i

628
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,840
have a notification come

629
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,000
that comes up on my phone if someone

630
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,520
sees it it just looks like my friend is

631
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
texting

632
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
but this is going to get really really

633
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,360
weird if a thumbnail pops up

634
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
um from my best friend with a you know

635
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,919
picture of

636
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,120
joke that's going to raise some

637
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,559
questions that i really don't want to

638
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
have to explain

639
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,960
so the next one is and this kind of goes

640
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,880
hand in hand um

641
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,400
with the uh the petraeus is the icloud

642
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
shopping list so apple actually has a

643
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
really super interesting feature

644
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,760
um that allows you to share

645
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
collaborative notes and this is a really

646
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,880
cool feature

647
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
for other applications um but what you

648
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,240
could

649
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
theoretically do is start a shopping

650
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,679
list and

651
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,840
you know it'll have grocery list you

652
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
know the first kind of few lines that

653
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,919
would be previewed on your note would be

654
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,720
you know batteries cheese bread wine and

655
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,240
then after that you can just carry on a

656
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,559
conversation with whoever you have as a

657
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,880
another collaborator on the note and

658
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,159
anyone kind of scrolling through your

659
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:48,720
phone

660
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
um unless they have questions about why

661
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
you have a collaborative grocery list

662
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
it's gonna look fairly normal um but

663
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
again if someone actually opens that

664
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,559
all of a sudden it's gonna look really

665
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,039
weird some of the things you have

666
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,760
added to your grocery list um and that

667
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,520
kind of brings us to

668
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,720
uh the david petraeus which if any of

669
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,080
you are i'm assuming most of you are

670
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
familiar with this

671
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,799
um he and his uh biographer who he was

672
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,320
having an affair with

673
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,080
uh basically were communicating

674
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
exclusively through gmail drafts

675
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
so they had a common email account one

676
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,440
of them would go in

677
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,080
write an email draft save it the other

678
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,280
one would log in

679
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
read it delete it make a new draft save

680
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,440
it and this is how they were

681
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,559
communicating

682
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,559
without actually having to send anything

683
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,080
back and forth

684
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,559
but again if anyone ever logs into that

685
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,320
email it's going to be pretty obvious

686
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,760
what that email is for

687
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,200
so probably not ideal and then you know

688
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
you have kind of the general

689
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,159
you know uh people have whatsapp

690
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,480
or other you know messaging platforms

691
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,600
that if they have family in other

692
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,360
countries it kind of you know goes back

693
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,679
to the whole like duplicate friend

694
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,440
you know oh that's no one that's you

695
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,200
know my my cousin who lives

696
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,880
in you know germany or france or

697
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,200
wherever and it's that sort of thing

698
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,480
um but the super super creative one

699
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,039
uh that i just i'm still not entirely

700
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,039
sure the application of this and why

701
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,279
samsung does this but for any of you

702
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,880
that have a samsung phone which i'm

703
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
hoping is none of you for security

704
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,120
reasons

705
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,679
um samsung doesn't actually allow you to

706
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,039
block people

707
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,440
uh samsung if you go in and block

708
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,799
someone

709
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,159
it will without ever uh indicating to

710
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,840
them that you've blocked them it'll just

711
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,720
neatly send

712
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,760
any messages that they send you into

713
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,559
this blocked messages folder that's like

714
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,000
four clicks off of your

715
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,360
general sms inbox and so what

716
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,760
i could theoretically do is you know if

717
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
i am hanging out with johnny

718
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
and i know jimmy might be texting me is

719
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,520
i'll just block jimmy for that period of

720
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,320
time

721
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,600
and any texts that jimmy sends me

722
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,799
are never going to show up on the phone

723
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,640
are never going to show up in my inbox

724
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
my phone's never going to light up ping

725
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,679
nothing

726
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,080
um but then after a period of time when

727
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,600
i either you know get back to my car or

728
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,960
get back home

729
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,679
you can reopen that folder unblock them

730
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,880
and no one is any

731
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,000
wiser i have no idea why samsung has

732
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
this as a feature

733
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,440
um if any of you guys know i'd be super

734
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,799
interested to know

735
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,480
um but that is uh a way that you know to

736
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,919
break character for a second

737
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,240
um something that one of my really sweet

738
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,159
girlfriends ran into and made me aware

739
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,039
of that i just thought was

740
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,640
super super fascinating and of course

741
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,360
no talk that deals with uh privacy

742
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,919
infosec romantic relationships

743
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,080
would be complete if we didn't reference

744
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,120
nudes and this is

745
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,039
super where privacy becomes really

746
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,640
really relevant here

747
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,520
regarding where any sensitive data of

748
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,320
your bits

749
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,919
ends up um so

750
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,039
the kind of uh first place that people

751
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,279
tend to hide these things are these like

752
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,960
vault apps that either

753
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,440
just look like a vault app or i've seen

754
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,880
them disguised as

755
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,400
solitaire apps and you know anyone that

756
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
has something like this on their phone

757
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,520
it's going to raise questions about you

758
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,840
know

759
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
why do you have this on your phone it's

760
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,600
going to look kind of suspicious

761
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,760
um so it's actually not a great place to

762
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
hide something if i'm actually trying to

763
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,320
be

764
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
you know kind of a shady skeevy tinder

765
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,760
lizard

766
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,679
so the next place that people go is the

767
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,880
trash cans

768
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,960
you know you delete something out but

769
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,320
you leave it in the trash

770
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,120
again probably not the best place you

771
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,159
know if

772
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,840
if someone's going to ask to go through

773
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,360
your phone they're probably going to

774
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,240
look there

775
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,720
so you know i is an advanced skeevy

776
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,320
tinder lizard just no better than to

777
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,000
hide something there

778
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,240
uh the next one which is you know kind

779
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,159
of a level up if you really want to

780
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,200
become

781
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,159
you know just kind of a more

782
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,559
sophisticated tinder lizard

783
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,240
is the strategic crop so

784
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,600
uh os agnostic apps like adobe lightroom

785
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,880
will let you do something really

786
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
interesting with your photos

787
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,640
where say you have a picture of

788
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,960
something we'll keep this pg-13 and not

789
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,000
r um

790
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,080
so you have a picture of something and

791
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,679
there happens to be a vase

792
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,600
or a lamp in the background what you can

793
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,360
actually do with that picture is crop it

794
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
to just be the base or the lamp

795
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,679
and when you scroll through your camera

796
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,200
roll it'll just look like

797
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,399
the vase or the lamp but if i want to

798
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,760
see that picture again

799
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,399
i can go into adobe lightroom hit crop

800
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,159
and revert the entire thing back to the

801
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,200
original

802
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
so someone would have to know what they

803
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,320
were looking for

804
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,000
to even think that the picture of you

805
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,600
know the face the lamp the flowers

806
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
whatever were maybe not

807
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,120
uh you know kind of not what they

808
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,679
appeared at first pass

809
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,880
and then the last one

810
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,679
um i actually found because part of this

811
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,440
talk i crowdsourced

812
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,039
um from some guys that i used to be

813
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,480
really good friends with in high school

814
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:56,880
you know

815
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,080
old old friends of mine that you know um

816
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,000
have made some poor choices in life that

817
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,360
i was aware of

818
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,200
and you know i i just generally asked

819
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,399
them i said you know how did you get

820
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,679
away with this like what were some of

821
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,279
the tactics that you used because i

822
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,960
would like to give a talk on this

823
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,840
and steal your creativity um for my own

824
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,000
purposes

825
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,840
and this i just thought was ridiculous

826
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,000
um that one of the guys

827
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,039
used to print pictures as

828
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,399
pdfs in his phone to his internal

829
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,200
storage

830
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,240
voicemail folder

831
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
because this morning cannot find the

832
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,480
discord chat link please help

833
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,840
um okay i don't know if bryson can get

834
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,799
on that okay

835
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,840
um yeah so he would

836
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,520
take girls nudes and he would store them

837
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,960
as a pdf file in his voicemail folder

838
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,640
because your voicemail can't pull over a

839
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,320
pdf so

840
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,000
someone would actually have to know to

841
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,159
go into the internal storage

842
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,039
of your phone and try to look at your

843
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,880
raw voicemail files

844
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,760
um so that one i and like again you know

845
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,279
this friend

846
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,000
my high school friend that did this was

847
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,480
not

848
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
like even a college educated person at

849
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,320
all i mean he's a blue collar forklift

850
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,440
operator

851
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
and you know has no uh you know kind of

852
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,000
formal background in check

853
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,760
and you know these kind of like just

854
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,840
wild creative things

855
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,640
that people are figuring out how to do

856
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
are really interesting and again

857
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,840
from privacy standpoint uh you know if

858
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,279
you're in a committed relationship with

859
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,360
someone and you are kind of sharing uh

860
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,440
those sort of intimate pictures

861
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,039
um and i'm not the person that's done

862
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,799
any of the work on this again

863
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,640
um you know this is a lot of work that's

864
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,000
been done by people that are you know

865
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,520
much more in the privacy sphere than me

866
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,880
but you would hope that those pictures

867
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,799
are being stored

868
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,159
in a much more kind of secure fashion

869
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,039
rather than just in you know kind of raw

870
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,960
form and some random internal storage

871
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,399
file where they could be accessed

872
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,159
without any sort of password or extra

873
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,120
security measures

874
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,559
and then of course the bane of every

875
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,559
pesky tinder lizards example

876
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,679
or of every pesky tinder lizard life is

877
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,760
your pesky notifications

878
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,320
so if i have my phone sitting up on the

879
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
table

880
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,679
and it's blowing up with notifications

881
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,520
that are suspicious like that's not a

882
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,960
good thing you know that's

883
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,799
that's how you kind of get had as a

884
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,240
pesky tinder lizard

885
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,960
so how do you get around this um the

886
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,360
most

887
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,520
rookie one is obviously going to be the

888
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,039
airplane mode

889
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,240
so this is you know your phone is

890
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,399
you know in airplane mode so that no

891
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,399
notifications can come through

892
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,559
um but to anyone who's looking at your

893
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,760
phone that's going to look really

894
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,360
suspicious you know we're not on a plane

895
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,960
we're at a brewery why is your phone on

896
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,399
airplane mode

897
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,640
um so then the next one is obviously

898
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,080
going to be you know kind of the

899
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,120
secret incognito locked messaging

900
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,200
app but as with the photovolts it's

901
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,559
going to look weird if i have that

902
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,679
because you know

903
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
why do i have that on my phone what do

904
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,200
you have to hide

905
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,360
uh so that's generally something that's

906
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,279
going to raise suspicion if i'm you know

907
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,000
kind of being this skeevy person

908
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,240
uh so kind of the next step that you

909
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,200
know we do

910
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,519
is you know either muting the contact so

911
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,760
that none of their things come through

912
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,840
so you know if i have signal and i

913
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,960
decide

914
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,480
that you know i just don't really want

915
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,279
to hear uh any notifications

916
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,720
from johnny while i'm out with jimmy

917
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,640
i'm just going to mute johnny's con or

918
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,799
mute johnny's contact in you know signal

919
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,600
sms whatever but that doesn't prevent me

920
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,440
from when i open it when i open up the

921
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,159
app

922
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,480
still seeing the uh you know the

923
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,880
notification or the message

924
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,279
um this also goes to deleting the app

925
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,559
which you can do but if you're

926
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,159
constantly re-downloading deleting the

927
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,640
app it's going to look strange

928
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,559
so again this one i actually come back

929
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,760
to that same

930
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,799
samsung soft block that you know no

931
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,320
notifications

932
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,600
ever come through because the message

933
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,200
never comes through which again if any

934
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
of you guys have any idea why samsung

935
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,799
has that on their phone

936
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,880
um i don't know and i would love to hear

937
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,240
your thoughts on that because i just

938
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,600
think it's super interesting

939
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,720
and so one thing that i learned when i

940
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,799
was in miami last year

941
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,000
at the s4 conference is that even the

942
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,760
best lizards fall

943
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,679
even you know the best strongest iguanas

944
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,840
when you know the the cold front moves

945
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,120
in even they

946
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,320
will fall from the trees so you know

947
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
we we've kind of gone through some of

948
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,480
the different ways that you know

949
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,799
liz the tinder lizard may you know

950
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,039
manipulate her phone manipulate the apps

951
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:39,919
on it

952
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,840
uh to make it look like you know she's

953
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,000
this innocent plant lamb who has nothing

954
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,120
to hide

955
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,039
um but if there's something to hide

956
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,120
there's always a way to find it

957
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,720
so location services

958
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,279
if you stay matched with someone that

959
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,519
you have met on a dating app

960
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,000
generally those uh apps will show you

961
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,279
how far away the person is

962
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,600
so if someone tells you that they are at

963
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,399
work

964
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,519
and you know they work roughly 15 miles

965
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,000
away from

966
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,760
you and you can check that on a map with

967
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,120
gps

968
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,919
but their app says that they are three

969
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,320
miles away from you

970
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,919
that probably suggests that they're not

971
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,000
exactly telling the truth um

972
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,080
this was uh the one uh

973
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,200
the one kind of personal one for me um

974
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
which i can't super get into because of

975
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,559
the lab but essentially

976
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,720
if you had someone who from a national

977
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,840
security

978
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,399
um aspect was transporting something

979
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,039
that was

980
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,399
sensitive and they left location

981
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,120
services

982
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,080
on their phone and you as a person who

983
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,480
had

984
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,840
you know had a beer with them knew what

985
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,600
they did for a living

986
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,360
it would be super problematic that you

987
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,080
could theoretically based on a

988
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,279
tinder or a bumble uh x miles away from

989
00:33:59,279 --> 00:33:59,600
you

990
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,519
track that material because they were

991
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,880
dumb enough to leave their location

992
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,640
services on

993
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,720
so again from a national security

994
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,960
privacy infrastruct perspective

995
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,280
you know this has consequences that

996
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,359
reach pretty far beyond just someone's

997
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,879
feelings getting hurt

998
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,359
you know suddenly uh someone that they

999
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,839
actually haven't verified

1000
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
themselves as being trustworthy can

1001
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:22,719
track

1002
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,000
national security stuff

1003
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,679
and that's kind of the the length that i

1004
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,280
can go about that in detail

1005
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,159
um one of the one of the really funny

1006
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,520
ones that i've seen

1007
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,639
um again based on the location services

1008
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,560
is uh if someone feels that their

1009
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,800
significant other is using

1010
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,599
um tactic number two about setting their

1011
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,239
location

1012
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,399
somewhere else that they go on business

1013
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,000
uh you can play that against them

1014
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,440
so say you were dating someone that

1015
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,359
traveled to san francisco a lot and you

1016
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,200
kind of had a feeling that you know

1017
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,119
maybe when they go

1018
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,119
out of town they're using tender bumble

1019
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,320
hinge whatever

1020
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
um next time they go out of town just

1021
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,480
make your own account you can make it

1022
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,800
you

1023
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
you can make it look like a honey pot

1024
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,200
and just set it for san francisco and

1025
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,680
swipe through your matches and you know

1026
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,760
see if the person comes up again this is

1027
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,920
super creepy and invasive but

1028
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,640
you know if if you are invested in

1029
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
finding out like there are ways to do

1030
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,799
this

1031
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,200
um and this one's my personal favorite i

1032
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,440
like to call this one the phone is lava

1033
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,400
and so like if if at any given time

1034
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,320
someone has suspicions you know really

1035
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,839
all you have to do to check that is

1036
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,839
reach for the person's phone

1037
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,680
and if they look like they just saw a

1038
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,960
ghost uh you probably have some reason

1039
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,359
to worry about um you know kind of

1040
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,240
suspicious

1041
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,280
stuff going around um you know kind of

1042
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,320
in that person's

1043
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,000
general tech device

1044
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,280
this one um uh someone

1045
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,880
uh capped is the dominoes and i actually

1046
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,680
found this

1047
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
on a one of my favorite podcasts that i

1048
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,000
listened to it's called call her daddy

1049
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,720
which is extra not pg-13 it's like way

1050
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
beyond r but it's hilarious

1051
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,040
and there was this girl that wrote in

1052
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,160
that basically

1053
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,599
thought her significant other um

1054
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,359
was not at work at night when he said he

1055
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,720
was and

1056
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,240
she wanted to and this i just thought

1057
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,760
was brilliant from a social engineering

1058
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,119
perspective

1059
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,720
and she wanted to check this but she

1060
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,160
didn't want to seem like you know she

1061
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,880
was

1062
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,040
psycho so she ordered doordash pizza

1063
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,640
to his work and doordash lets you track

1064
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,680
the driver

1065
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,359
so you know you can call them and be

1066
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,599
like hey babe like you're outside of

1067
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,960
or they're outside of your work like

1068
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,200
where are you i got you pizza delivered

1069
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,680
you're working late um you know and if

1070
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,200
all of a sudden that driver has no one

1071
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,240
to meet

1072
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,040
uh that's that's probably a pretty big

1073
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,920
tell

1074
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,640
um which i thought was just absolutely

1075
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,960
hysterical

1076
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,839
and really all of this to say that you

1077
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:04,160
know

1078
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,640
for as much as there are skeevy tinder

1079
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,560
lizard ttps that people

1080
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,839
use um

1081
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,119
women especially i feel like um at least

1082
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,079
you know kind of the women that i've

1083
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,520
come in contact with

1084
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,800
are like borderline fbi and there are

1085
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,320
uh you know for as much as there are

1086
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,240
creative non-tech

1087
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
uh social engineers on kind of the

1088
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,599
skeevy tender lizard side

1089
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,359
there are some also really super

1090
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,720
creative

1091
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,839
um people who come up with ways to

1092
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,160
you know kind of alarm trip on this who

1093
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,119
are also not

1094
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,760
technically uh you know kind of formally

1095
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,640
trained at all

1096
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,040
either and i just think it's super

1097
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,760
interesting

1098
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,640
um for us as a community to realize that

1099
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,359
that

1100
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,920
you know kind of outside the sphere of

1101
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,240
infosec and outside the sphere of doing

1102
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,040
physical pen

1103
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,440
testing you know whether we realize it

1104
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,839
or not we are surrounded by people who

1105
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:58,960
in just their personal

1106
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,760
everyday interactions are actually doing

1107
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,359
some pretty impressive social

1108
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,880
engineering back and forth with each

1109
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,680
other

1110
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,800
um you know that haven't really received

1111
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,720
any training on how to do this

1112
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,760
um you know haven't been to our

1113
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,880
conferences don't do this professionally

1114
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,000
and you know are actually scary scary

1115
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,280
good at it and so again closing

1116
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,640
statements

1117
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,400
just a reminder that really all

1118
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,760
manipulation

1119
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,680
to achieve an end result is social

1120
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
engineering this isn't something that we

1121
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
have any kind of monopoly on

1122
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,079
um the the general population is way

1123
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,079
better at this than i think we give them

1124
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,040
credit for

1125
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,079
especially when the urge to reproduce um

1126
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,119
is involved and uh also

1127
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,839
that you know bring your own device

1128
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,680
policies um this effects because there

1129
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,240
may be

1130
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
a different workaround people do with

1131
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,680
their devices there may be things stored

1132
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,119
on those devices

1133
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,400
that are attached to your corporate

1134
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,160
networks that you might not want stored

1135
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
on those devices attached to your

1136
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,960
corporate networks

1137
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,560
and you know also the privacy

1138
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,240
implications of where

1139
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,720
people hide things when they're trying

1140
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,920
to be deceitful

1141
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
that just do not in any way shape or

1142
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,040
form

1143
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,560
um lend themselves to privacy and that

1144
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,280
is

1145
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,880

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,000
so are you going to be like an elephant

1175
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,280
now not a unicorn because you have a

1176
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,319
long memory

1177
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,880
is that like a thing i i think uh

1178
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,040
unicorns besides having access to an

1179
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,200
infinite bag of holding because how else

1180
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,240
could we carry anything um we also

1181
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,599
can put memories there i love whoever

1182
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,760
wild west is the phone is lava works

1183
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,079
great with my teenage daughter

1184
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,280
uh yeah so um i

1185
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
actually had very smart before their

1186
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,319
time parents

1187
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,000
uh who when i was you know 15 or 16 or

1188
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,520
however old i was when i got my first

1189
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,560
cell phone

1190
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,200
um every day when i got home from school

1191
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,280
at five o'clock my dad took away my cell

1192
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,079
phone

1193
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,000
and locked it and he said nothing good

1194
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,760
happens on a teenage girl's cell phone

1195
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,000
after

1196
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,160
dinner that's a smart man

1197
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,440
yeah after after dinner that's so that's

1198
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,480
the corollary to the

1199
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,839
nothing good happens at 2 am

1200
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,640
conversation too

1201
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,160
that's awesome now that was those really

1202
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,640
good talk there's some interesting uh

1203
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,160
there's always interesting implications

1204
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,680
when you talk about bring your own

1205
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,520
device from an enterprise standpoint but

1206
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,800
the general population

1207
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,000
is very very creative and we've lost

1208
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,040
the the insight that we're

1209
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,720
technologically smart and we think we

1210
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,200
can

1211
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,720
lock these phones down the general

1212
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,800
population is like a bunch of teenage

1213
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
daughters they will find a way to

1214
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,480
make whatever they're trying to do

1215
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,960
happen on their phone

1216
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,800
no and i think it's super interesting

1217
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,160
because uh

1218
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,599
you know both myself and a few of my

1219
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,200
really close girlfriends you know kind

1220
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,240
of had interactions with people that

1221
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,839
uh we're not ideal but like

1222
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,240
you know a few months removed from it

1223
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,680
happening i was like you know i

1224
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,520
i almost like can't even be mad about

1225
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,119
that because like that was impressive

1226
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,240
the way you did that

1227
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,960
like i like i would have not thought to

1228
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,640
try to hide something they're like

1229
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,480
that's pretty creative like i almost

1230
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,000
have to just give you props for it

1231
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,359
yeah again like teenage daughters

1232
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,200
there's always a way

1233
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,520
yeah i i'm fortunate or unfortunate

1234
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
enough depending on who you're talking

1235
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,160
to to not have children

1236
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,200
yet so my uh my dog doesn't give me

1237
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,160
these sorts of headaches

1238
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,480
i'm surprised ansel doesn't have a twit

1239
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,640
uh social media account

1240
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,560
yeah i mean i feel like he just he gets

1241
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,319
so much spotlight on mine on

1242
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,960
on his own that i just i worry that

1243
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,400
it'll go to his head but he'll get like

1244
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,359
foggy ego

1245
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,599
all of a sudden be like well and also

1246
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,200
for my eco stick like i don't know if i

1247
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,960
could handle it my dog social media had

1248
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,210
more followers than me

1249
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,160
[Laughter]

1250
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,640
you only laugh but it's probably serious

1251
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,440
yeah

1252
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,880
yeah i don't want to have to admit that

1253
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,000
like i don't want to have to look at my

1254
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,760
dog and be like

1255
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
you're more popular to my colleagues but

1256
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,359
i am like maybe you should just give

1257
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,839
this talk

1258
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,760
well besides the threat to your ego from

1259
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,960
your dog uh

1260
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,920
the continuation of these kinds of

1261
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,640
behaviors

1262
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,480
which can range from i like that you

1263
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,640
added the levels from the

1264
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,760
innocuous to the level 9000

1265
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,240
uh creep what is your prediction for

1266
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,640
uh the threat landscape in 2021

1267
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,359
um in ics pacific in general

1268
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,480
your call oh man okay

1269
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,400
choose your own adventure choose your

1270
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,160
own i don't know yeah

1271
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,200
only i'm not giving you options no i

1272
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
mean i

1273
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,880
from what we personally are going to be

1274
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,000
dealing with i think there's going to be

1275
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,359
a lot of knee-jerk

1276
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,079
to solar winds that's going to distract

1277
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:02,640
from

1278
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,440
other things that are happening um at

1279
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,640
least for you know kind of q1 2021

1280
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,920
i think everyone's gonna be pretty rock

1281
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,839
around the wrapped around the axle about

1282
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:12,960
sunburst

1283
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,560
um and i worry that that's going to make

1284
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,480
people miss other things that are kind

1285
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,960
of going on under their nose

1286
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,359
um that's kind of a big concern of mine

1287
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,400
um

1288
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,119
john strain and all them did an awesome

1289
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:25,920
podcast

1290
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,400
that i totally agree with where they

1291
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,760
basically

1292
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,359
uh talking about this is going to set

1293
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,960
patching back

1294
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,240
by you know five years um we're already

1295
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,079
seeing that about you know people

1296
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,119
kind of pointing their fingers and

1297
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,640
saying hi i told you so we shouldn't

1298
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,040
patch look at what happened to them

1299
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,920
um and one of the things they brought up

1300
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,720
during that webcast

1301
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,839
that i understand but i'm not

1302
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,839
necessarily sure i agree with was

1303
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,960
uh jonathan from rendition sec

1304
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,760
said that he thought that uh he was

1305
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,040
essentially comparing

1306
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,160
um corporate leadership to anti-vaxxers

1307
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,520
that they were they were going to be

1308
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,280
he was essentially making the point of

1309
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,280
not patching because of solar winds is

1310
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,200
equivalent to not taking the vaccine

1311
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
because of side effects

1312
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,880
which i can see his line of thinking

1313
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,800
there but i would

1314
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,640
reframe it that you know this was an

1315
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,720
intentional act this wasn't like a side

1316
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,280
effect

1317
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,440
of you know like a nice yes we see that

1318
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,359
sometimes applying a patch has an

1319
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,119
unintended consequence and

1320
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,599
you know it's a thing but i think that

1321
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,119
this is much more akin to

1322
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,720
you know we caught someone trying to

1323
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,880
poison a batch of vaccines

1324
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,160
and now you know your csos and uh you

1325
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,680
know other people on your security team

1326
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,119
are a little apprehensive about

1327
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,480
uh you know taking that vaccine because

1328
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,240
if they tried to poison one batch like

1329
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,400
they're probably doing that with other

1330
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,920
stuff and you know that's a concern

1331
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,280
and i think that we need to be

1332
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
sympathetic about that

1333
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,960
um and maybe be a little kinder to them

1334
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,119
than anti-vaxxer labels

1335
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,079
yeah no i mean i think threat landscape

1336
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,079
21 2021 is gonna be

1337
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,359
you know a lot of the same stuff that

1338
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,880
we're seeing now already and then a lot

1339
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,680
more um

1340
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,119
you know kind of continuation on from

1341
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,359
the sunburst stuff

1342
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,200
i think that now that we know before and

1343
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,319
it's already been popped we're gonna

1344
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,000
find more of it because like this wasn't

1345
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,160
their only poker in the fire

1346
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,920
and that's that's not high side until so

1347
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,079
i know i know one comp one large company

1348
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,160
personally and a couple of other ones uh

1349
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,440
that are not as bad but they were like

1350
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,560
yeah this wasn't a problem we hadn't

1351
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,520
patched it in two years

1352
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,359
kept making like he he hahas on twitter

1353
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,280
about it about you know

1354
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,280
like oh we haven't patched and i'm like

1355
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,960
that's

1356
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,280
that's like saying i don't have any iocs

1357
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,040
for it so you just compromised in

1358
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,920
general

1359
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,599
well and if it's not patched it's like

1360
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,599
making fun of people

1361
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,000
that like have a vulnerability and a

1362
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,119
smart door lock

1363
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,839
you never lock your door like that

1364
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,800
like we cash for a reason guys like

1365
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,480
there's probably a whole end if you

1366
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,400
haven't patched like

1367
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
maybe now's not the time to get super

1368
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
like morally on your high horse about

1369
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,119
that

1370
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,560
well that's not to extend this because

1371
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,000
we don't have too much more time but i

1372
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,520
read an interesting article

1373
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,640
uh i was a research study i was about a

1374
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,839
year ago and they were talking about

1375
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:26,400
that

1376
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,800
patching overall actually introduces

1377
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,480
more vulnerabilities in the long term

1378
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,040
on average

1379
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
yeah i i of course because it's uh it's

1380
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,760
a bit of a controversial statement and

1381
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,359
it's counter-intuitive

1382
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,319
but the the simple premise that they

1383
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,520
they kind of pointed to

1384
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,800
is that increased code complexity

1385
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,480
typically leads to

1386
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,000
increased surface area and increased

1387
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,760
problems the end of the day

1388
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,160
they're fixing known issues but it turns

1389
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,319
out developers inherently introduce new

1390
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,000
issues anytime they put

1391
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,760
bits to the screen to commit

1392
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,400
um they went through it looking across a

1393
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,599
range of things and it was

1394
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,319
it was interesting because it was uh i'm

1395
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,440
always a fan of anything that is

1396
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,800
empirically driven in our industry

1397
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,200
because

1398
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,599
we get a lot of opinions we get a lot of

1399
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,880
well i did this in my garage and

1400
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,720
therefore look what it could be

1401
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,400
uh we don't get a lot of this is an

1402
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,319
industry-wide study anchored

1403
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:27,200
in in data that is uh

1404
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,400
statistically relevant yeah

1405
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,240
well and i mean kind of to that point i

1406
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,160
think that you know to be

1407
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,160
sane and successful in this space like

1408
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,800
you just you have to embrace the nature

1409
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,599
of the whack-a-mole

1410
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,359
like as the lizard

1411
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,839
yeah that's that tenacity that that

1412
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,359
brought us to this industry i think it's

1413
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:49,760
a

1414
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,160
required characteristic because of that

1415
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,799
very nature

1416
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,920
well max thank you for uh mixing up and

1417
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,119
keeping people awake in the middle of

1418
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,400
the day with a

1419
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,680
spicy take

1420
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,920
well you know it was it's the first

1421
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,000
non-ics talk i've given so you know i

1422
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,319
had to

1423
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,680
i had to make sure that it would you

1424
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,839
know stick in people's memories

1425
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,359
2020. yeah

1426
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,160
well and like i mean honestly it's grim

1427
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:20,800
com like

1428
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,880
grin grim con i mean nothing i can say

1429
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,640
could possibly be more ridiculous than

1430
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,319
whatever bryson's wearing so i mean that

1431
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,240
the freedom of that is just always

1432
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,839
that's a good point you're done

1433
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,640
thank you see ya
