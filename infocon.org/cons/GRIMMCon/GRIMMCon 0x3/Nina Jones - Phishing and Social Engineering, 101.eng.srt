track for grim con zero x3 our first

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,000
speaker today is nina jones um i have

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
well first of all her actual talk as you

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,480
can probably see on screen is fishing

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,840
and social engineering

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,960
101 so uh nina's currently on her second

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960
year studying network and i.t security

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
at norov school of technology and

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,040
digital media through her studies she's

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,960
come to find an interest in phishing and

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,239
social engineering

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,840
which means she has found ways to

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,320
get great grades through class and well

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,879
played

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,000
right that's the one thing

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,680
uh that's my reader too i i agree jeff

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,920
as a result of your paper next time i go

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,440
back to school

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
fishing social engineering at the mark

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,399
of year end of year one at norov

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,160
nina lives on a small island on the

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
outskirts of norway

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,920
in a county where due to outsourcing no

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,479
i.t jobs exist on the market

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,680
him so if you're looking she's awesome

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
she's presenting it at conferences

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,720
um it'd be nice to land nicely

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,159
into a good environment as well uh

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,400

video for your presentation

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,640

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,079
discord i think you're in discord as

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,880

and i moved to norway as a child a

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,680
part-time employee

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040

band and to top it all off i am a single

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,680
mother

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,319
um back in uh back in june

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,519
when i was

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,040
finishing my

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,879
first year at north i am

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,680
had to

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,840
[Music]

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
deliver

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,200
and social engineering and as i was

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,000
writing

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,120
the um the uh the report i discovered

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
that the definitions of phishing

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,680
engineering um live

74
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,680
contradiction without

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
so

76
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,879
ladies and gentlemen we are

77
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,799
investigating technical issues on

78
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
uh looks like it might be on nina's side

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,040
it might be somewhere along the way

80
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
um nina if you can hear me i would

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,239
recommend turning

82
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,159
off your webcam for the sake of

83
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,239
bandwidth and going to

84
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,319
audio only for the presentation

85
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,440
let's see nina is okay i think she's

86
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,759
rebooting or reconnecting on her side

87
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,440
which is just fine that's exactly what

88
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,560
we want so

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
in the meantime uh let's let's give a

90
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,120
few seconds about ourselves we didn't

91
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
properly introduce ourselves wesley do

92
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,759
you want to go first a little bit of

93
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,520
background on yourself

94
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
sure um i'm wesley i'm here to co-host

95
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,440
with jeff

96
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,199
i'm just a tinker of things

97
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,960
i know pretty much absolutely nothing

98
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,560
about cyber security they give me certs

99
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
for whatever reasons and things like

100
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,800
that

101
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
um no i've been i've been taping for by

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,000
maybe about

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
10 years in the field and everything

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
i've done a little bit of everything

105
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,160
um like i said i still google everything

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,880
when it comes out

107
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
i google about google that's kind of my

108
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
my mantra on google about google

109
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,759
to really just understand things but

110
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,720
um you know i've did pen testing its

111
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
response and everything that i'm i'm

112
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,680
more of like a blue teamer i like blue

113
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,560
team you know

114
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
i don't want to say i hate red team or

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
you know i try to be absolutely

116
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
definitely something that i def i

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
definitely talk trash until i get my

118
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,800
butt kicked

119
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
on uh on like uh purple team engagement

120
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,800
so you know

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,479
it gets me better but you know it makes

122
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,840
them bring out their bad tricks

123
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,800
all right and as for myself let's see

124
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
not connected to audio

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,120
uh on nina so that's on you to reconnect

126
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
and reshare

127
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
there you are is everything yep and you

128
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,560
can see it

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,039
we can give it a shot as is um it may

130
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,320
have been bandwidth issues it may have

131
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,960
been local

132
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
cpu side it may have been something

133
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,000
outside of our control

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,199
um but if you want to uh essentially

135
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,240
restart as

136
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,960
is uh with webcam that's fine if it is a

137
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,479
bandwidth issue i have found that

138
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,080
turning off your webcam

139
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,240
but conserving that audio for sorry

140
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
conserving that bandwidth for audio

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,319
may be a right call so maybe let's try

142
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,120
with uh

143
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,759
audio and video and then worst case and

144
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
we have time by the way we're not we're

145
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
just fine don't worry

146
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,919
um but let's go ahead okay

147
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,960
where did i where where did i fall out

148
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,039
uh you were fell out somewhere in the

149
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,440
last uh slide i would recommend going

150
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
back uh at least one slide

151
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,280
yeah maybe one of two slides um another

152
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,479
slide

153
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,080
yep we heard your

154
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,919
intro uh essentially a single mother

155
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,039
background was the

156
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,199
the uh that was the clearest part that

157
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,800
came in

158
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,520
that's what a handshake disconnect yeah

159
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,400
that's pretty much it

160
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,520
so uh okay i will drop

161
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
off and let you uh take it from here

162
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,479
there you go all right

163
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,479
okay uh for what it's worth for me at

164
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,479
least audio is immediately cutting out

165
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,280
nina can you hear me

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,440
okay

167
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
do you have a different device you can

168
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,479
present from

169
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,680
i know it's last minute where okay

170
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,080
okay no things are going okay

171
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,520
no no stuff happens this is totally fine

172
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,800
uh i will share it seems only when it's

173
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
going full screen for whatever reason

174
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,240
problems that yeah that

175
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
those gremlins they're going to keep

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
going

177
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,440
may i ask you hope everything is fine

178
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,520
reliable and i'm back in business

179
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:13,840
um so well um

180
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
nina i cannot reliably hear you sorry

181
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,479
all right um we we may try for a

182
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,719
condensed version of the presentation

183
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,679
itself

184
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,440
uh but it looks like due to technical

185
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,000
issues uh we're not gonna reliably be

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,799
able to do the

187
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,519
entire presentation where only about 10

188
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,159
minutes and

189
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,800
we have 45 minutes allocated per speaker

190
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,399
even though each talk is around 30

191
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,120
minutes so

192
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,399
we're seeing a little bit of inside

193
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
baseball uh real quick right here

194
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,640
maybe go to panel mode have someone else

195
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,399
share the slides and nina talk

196
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
mike great idea um the the only thing is

197
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
coordination at this point

198
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,000
um i can reach out of band to discord

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
but i think she's rebooting her machine

200
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,480
yeah everybody uh may fix that okay and

201
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,600
nina is back in i will make presenter

essentially wired is better like i i

212
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,920
believe in wireless a lot but not enough

213
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,399
for

214
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,839
uh presenting somebody else uses the

215
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,720
microwave

216
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160

thanks everybody for your um uh report

220
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,640
so many contrary and uh paradoxing

221
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,000
uh definitions and i decided for the

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,839
sake of the report

223
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,640
well uh the uh start sh

224
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,720
restart is a little bit of a sign that

225
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,519
uh nina's trying for one last reboot

226
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,760
uh which is totally fine we will find a

227
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
way

228
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,760
there we go oh bryson mentioned

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,839
definitely graduate to the expert track

239
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,360
one talk and you're expert

240
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,079
just letting you know

241
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
well it looks like this was a grim con

242
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,360
xerox one was a fair time ago but uh

243
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,399
it's more about you've been helped up by

244
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,519
others and

245
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,200
at some point you have some advice you

246
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
have uh

247
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,480
made some mistakes of your own and

248
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,760
you're happy to share those mistakes

249
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,360
with others they don't have to make them

250
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
all right uh we can we can both be

251
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,240
simultaneously mentor and mentee

252
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
i have folks that i help and i have lots

253
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,279
of folks that have helped me

254
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,320
so same idea absolutely

255
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
that that's definitely a true statement

256
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,360
because i know when

257
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,399
even helping people um they're going

258
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,160
deep into a subject that i know a little

259
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
bit about i know

260
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,880
how things work they definitely helped

261
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,279
me to kind of understand the material

262
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
understand how to present it the way

263
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,079
they store it the way they want to tell

264
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,920
their story like hey that's a great idea

265
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,200
how to tell that story

266
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,480
i'm always learning something from

267
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
speakers you know don't don't be afraid

268
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,760
you can always learn something everybody

269
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,800
has something to share

270
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,320
whether it's the stories would present

271
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,560
way to really just title something i

272
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,839
i've learned a lot about

273
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,399
putting titles on uh presentations it

274
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,839
makes a huge difference in what you're

275
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,040
trying to convey what you're trying to

276
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,000
talk about so

277
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,120
yeah i have a favorite image on this

278
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,920
that i

279
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,320
just love i'll share my screen here

280
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,160
momentarily

281
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,199
open image new tab

282
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,680
go to i hope to see all of our attendees

283
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,079
present present as well you know even if

284
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,360
it's just something

285
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,200
um simple like hey you know how to

286
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
better your tcp connection or something

287
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
like that i don't know you know

288
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,720
so i gave

289
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,760
uh we can try for uh

290
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,120
swap again nina yeah thank you

291
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
i've already rebooted my system to see

292
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,399
if that helps

293
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
okay are you uh still have the same

294
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,240
internet connection and still uh on

295
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,200
wireless

296
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,240
it may be the issue more than anything

297
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,959
yes and yes as i don't have any other

298
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,240
alternatives

299
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,079
that's fine yeah we'll we'll give us

300
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,839
another pass through don't worry

301
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,320
this is okay this happens you'll be just

302
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,600
fine

303
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,120
do not worry all right i will uh

304
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
mute and stop my webcam and let you i

305
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,160
would recommend since it does seem to be

306
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
bandwidth related or internet access

307
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,360
related uh

308
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,040
we would love to see your beautiful face

309
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
but uh we'll stay probably say webcam

310
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,839
off as my recommendation

311
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
all right thank you

312
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,720
am i am i on i think i'm on okay well

313
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,480
um yeah when i was writing my report

314
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,040
i discovered that the definitions for

315
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
phishing and social engineering

316
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
were contradicting each other and for

317
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,920
the sake of the report

318
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,079
and for the flow of the report i decided

319
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,240
that social engineering

320
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,800
is a technique used to fish and that was

321
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079
the definition i went for

322
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,279
so defining phishing i wrote that it is

323
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,600
an umbrella term which employs several

324
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
techniques to acquire personal details

325
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,880
in pursuance

326
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
of illegitimately extracting money from

327
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,800
a victim

328
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,199
while josh prulinger he claims that

329
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,959
social engineering is the art of

330
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,800
exploiting human psychology

331
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
rather than technical hacking techniques

332
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,120
to gain access to buildings systems or

333
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,639
data

334
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,440
and that's quite an important thing to

335
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,360
remember that social engineers do not

336
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,880
need to know anything

337
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,760
about coding or programming or hacking

338
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,160
or

339
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,959
anything which has to do with hacking

340
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
when you come when you think of hacking

341
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,060
um so um

342
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,880
[Music]

343
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,040
some techniques which social engineers

344
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,079
use

345
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,199
are on the left

346
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,120
hand side and on the right hand side um

347
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,680
these techniques can often then be used

348
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,600
for fishing

349
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,639
and some of these may be uh maybe

350
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,079
techniques you've heard of before

351
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,720
and others may be ones which are

352
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,360
completely new to you

353
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
here are more techniques which i

354
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,480
encourage you to

355
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,519
look up uh as they

356
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,399
are outside the scope of the report uh i

357
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,000
do wish i had more time to talk about

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,839
them but my time is already running out

359
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,680
um when i wrote the report i chose to

360
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,440
raise awareness because um

361
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,079
according to a state of fishing report

362
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,279
from 2020

363
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,399
88 of businesses worldwide experienced

364
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,199
spear phishing attacks the potterman

365
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,839
institute

366
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,079
um uh identifies that

367
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,720
uh through a study on plain sight

368
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,560
hacking

369
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,160
uh which was conducted on 46 companies

370
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,199
357 trials

371
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,120
then 91 of the hacks were success

372
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
successful

373
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,240
and out of those hacks 49

374
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,480
needed less than 15 minutes to complete

375
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,839
the hack

376
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,639
and the fbi reports that the financial

377
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,160
losses from business email

378
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
email compromise accumulated to 1.7

379
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,160
billion

380
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,519
us dollars in 2019 alone

381
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,519
so phishing is very easy um

382
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,079
a 2016 study um pointed out that 46

383
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,480
of surveyed leaders said their companies

384
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,440
fell victim to social engineering

385
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
and 50 of the leaders said that their

386
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,519
training towards their

387
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,920
employees was ineffective but why is it

388
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,599
ineffective

389
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,160
why do employees keep pushing the

390
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,119
buttons

391
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,240
for or unopening the mails and letting

392
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,400
people in who they don't know

393
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,240
so i wanted to look into that and how do

394
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,199
we train our employees

395
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,160
so the training techniques um which are

396
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,039
used

397
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,559
uh i i went through case studies and i

398
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,480
went through research and articles

399
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,360
and um the national institute of

400
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,880
standards and technology

401
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,919
they have a um a

402
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
special publications report which um

403
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,240
employs uh how to design develop and

404
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
implement security awareness program

405
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,799
um while a a

406
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,880
report called teaching johnny not to

407
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,799
fall for fish proved that interactive

408
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,799
games are most successful in raising

409
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,320
awareness

410
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,440
so um in their study they

411
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
found that if the goal was to identify

412
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,919
fishing websites they

413
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,559
placed 14 people in three different

414
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,679
groups all

415
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,240
three groups with 14 individuals in each

416
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,360
pardon me

417
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
um where group number one was given

418
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,280
existing training material where all

419
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
they had to do was to read

420
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,440
uh about fishing websites the second

421
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,799
group was given a

422
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,600
a tutorial plus the third group was

423
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
shown

424
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,080
again where they had to play a game on

425
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,320
how to identify efficient websites

426
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,200
and the improvement uh was uh most

427
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,000
success

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,919
successful for those who game they were

429
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,559
tested both before and after the test

430
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,679
and um uh and

431
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,880
in 2017 the use of games was yet again

432
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
uh proven to be the most successful by

433
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,039
another study by agamdi

434
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,240
um so in my report which i wrote

435
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
i made up a fictitious company

436
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,880
who had been subjected to a

437
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,679
um to a penetrate penetration test

438
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,840
and uh and we need to find out what

439
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,919
their own vulnerabilities were

440
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,360
and what we needed to focus on so uh we

441
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,760
decided to go for social engineering

442
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,320
and uh so uh tailgating

443
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,039
which is um a technique within social

444
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,880
engineering it occurs when social

445
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,200
engineers exploit the naivety

446
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
and trust of authorized personnel to

447
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,360
gain access to the company's facilities

448
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
and the examples of

449
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,559
tailgating uh can be acting as a

450
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,919
delivery driver so

451
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,160
you can pretend to have many boxes in

452
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
your arms and then try to

453
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,679
get somebody to open the door for you

454
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,640
because you're not able to do it

455
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,760
yourself

456
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,840
pretending to be a new employee hang

457
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,600
around the brake area to gain trust

458
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,679
which is especially relevant if the gate

459
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,799
the brake area

460
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,160
is around the main entrance acting is

461
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
part of the company's regular service

462
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
provider

463
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,480
uh if you think about it uh

464
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,960
companies normally use the same business

465
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,760
providers

466
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
no service providers uh so it should be

467
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,400
quite easy to dress up as the

468
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,760
electrician and then

469
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,200
get and get themselves in impersonating

470
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,440
an

471
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,320
employee who has lost the access card is

472
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
another way of tailgating

473
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,200
the mitigation against tailgating is to

474
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,600
train

475
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
employees on the risks of tailgating

476
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
hire security guards and receptionists

477
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,679
and train them accordingly

478
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,159
install rfid locks on gates combined

479
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
with the detection security systems

480
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,720
which

481
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,520
and the rfid locks they can resemble the

482
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,000
ones

483
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
the cards when you get a hotel room that

484
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,080
has an rfid lock

485
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,120
uh and connect these locks to the

486
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,280
identity of the employee or the cards

487
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,679
invest in high quality surveying skier

488
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,440
don't skimp out because you get what you

489
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,039
what you pay for block tailgaters uh

490
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,000
by not holding doors for unauthorized

491
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,799
personnel

492
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,200
and train employees to stay alert if

493
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,240
there are

494
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,919
um strangers uh in the building

495
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,880
and make sure the company badge is free

496
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,799
from personal details it is absolutely

497
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,720
not necessarily to say that

498
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,760
the receptionist called peter and

499
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,520
he is the receptionist

500
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,360
shoulder surfing is another thing it is

501
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,960
another technique

502
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,039
uh it's the practice of watching a

503
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,799
person who is getting money from a

504
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,559
machine filling out a form

505
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,320
in order to find out their personal

506
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
information and examples of shoulder

507
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,280
surfing

508
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,919
are on the commute to work during the

509
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,720
lunch break

510
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,159
spying through windows or just an open

511
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,159
office

512
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,600
to mitigate er against shoulder surfing

513
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,760
um you can watch your angles make sure

514
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,200
when you're looking at your screen if

515
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
you're typing in a password

516
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
or if there's something important on the

517
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
screen that nobody can see

518
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,200
the screen create strong and nonsense

519
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
passwords

520
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,360
and don't reuse passwords

521
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,880
cover windows invest in an app which

522
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,120
stores password or a password

523
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,280
manager and in the times of

524
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,679
working remotely know who you are

525
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,600
letting into your home

526
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,679
so if you have booked an electrician to

527
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,520
come and fix your lighting

528
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,240
then know that the electrician is who he

529
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,039
say who

530
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,960
or she says uh he is and um

531
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,600
uh even call the company and ask is is

532
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,880
this person who was supposed to come

533
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
dumpster diving is a practice of digging

534
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,559
through a company's trash bins or

535
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,960
dumpster to gain information

536
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
another man's trust is another man's

537
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,400
treasure

538
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,120
and to mitigate against dumpster diving

539
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,960
you can invest in a microcut shredder

540
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,679
which spreads

541
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,159
everything and with everything i don't

542
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:48,880
only mean

543
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,320
papers i mean laptops you know discarded

544
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,960
laptops

545
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,280
external hard drives discarded phones

546
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,559
anything where valuable information

547
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,799
can be stored and if you have an

548
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,720
incident response team in your company

549
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
then encourage the team to investigate

550
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
discarded items

551
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,080
plain sight and theft refers to stealing

552
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
information which is visible throughout

553
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,400
the building

554
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
it must not be confused with shoulder

555
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,320
surfing as plain sight indicates what is

556
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
visible to the naked eye even when the

557
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,559
employee is not there

558
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,640
anything readily accessible and not

559
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
locked in is vulnerable to theft

560
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,480
if i'd had a bit more time i would have

561
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,679
uh

562
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,960
indulged you in this article

563
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,120
uh the headline reads hawaii prepares

564
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,080
for unlikely north korea missile threat

565
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,279
if you google that you will have

566
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,720
a very entertaining hour

567
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,039
or two just reading through about what

568
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,000
happened it is

569
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,039
uh nobody was a hurt um

570
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,679
and everything ended well so it's a good

571
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,320
it's a good read

572
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,080
to mitigate against the plain sight and

573
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,880
theft

574
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,080
um make sure

575
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,840
uh your employees can secure their

576
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
belongings preferably in a locker where

577
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
there is an rfid

578
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,400
lock so they can use the same card to

579
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,440
open up

580
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,039
the rock around the and the doors

581
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,480
um i keep a clean desk

582
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,840
avoid post-it notes um

583
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,799
make sure even the cleaning closet has a

584
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,320
an rfid lock

585
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,799
because if a perpetrator can get into

586
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,919
the cleaning closet

587
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,440
there are lots of chemicals there which

588
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,520
can do a lot of damage on um

589
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,440
on people and potentially victims

590
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,480
uh and guests who come to the company

591
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,799
should register with a momentary rfid

592
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,080
guest id card

593
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,559
tech support and wishing is an

594
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,159
electronic fraud tactic

595
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
in which individuals are tricked into

596
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,159
revealing critical financial or personal

597
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,279
information

598
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,039
to unauthorized entities in such

599
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,840
instances scammers use a spoofed

600
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,000
normally local area code this is not

601
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,400
relevant to norway as in norway we don't

602
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,720
use local area codes anymore we only use

603
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,320
mobile phones

604
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,880
um gather information to use towards an

605
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,600
attack that's

606
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,760
what they uh that's what tech support

607
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,120
does um

608
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,000
so an example of that is that um an

609
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,760
employee receives a phone call by

610
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,120
somebody claiming to be from tech

611
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,000
support

612
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and says i'm going to restart your

613
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,279
system please

614
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,440
give me your login credentials and i

615
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,360
will set everything up for you

616
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,840
so train your employees to be vigilant

617
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,360
of such

618
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,559
um also train your employees to verify

619
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,679
unknown incoming calls uh to report

620
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,559
incidences to the incident response team

621
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,000
uh or the it team or the the

622
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,559
or the boss for that instance be

623
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,799
suspicious and refuse to reveal explicit

624
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
information over the phone

625
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,880
implore a zero trust policy it is not

626
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
necessary that the receptionist

627
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,279
knows what's going on in the meeting but

628
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,799
that the receptionist needs to know

629
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,640
there is a meeting going on is of course

630
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,000
important

631
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
and i learned this one a couple days ago

632
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,200
send the

633
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,880
uh the scammer on a wild goose chase

634
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,720
um give them fake information and

635
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,279
just completely waste their time the

636
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,440
federal communications commission

637
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,360
suggests the checklist which i have

638
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,480
posted on the right

639
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,279
hand side um it is uh

640
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,000
of course free to download it and use it

641
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,640
for yourself

642
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,279
in phishing and spearfishing attacks the

643
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,279
classic phishing email scams are when

644
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,279
scammers distribute the same email to

645
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,200
possibly thousands of recipients on a

646
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,039
mailing list hoping someone takes the

647
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,760
bait

648
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,520
while spearfishing builds upon the

649
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,360
information the adversary already has

650
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,200
attained

651
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,679
the fishing and spearfishing attacks

652
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,799
exploit human

653
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,279
vulnerabilities such as fear greed

654
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,000
kindness and stress

655
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,200
so remember that if the person already

656
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,760
knows

657
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,520
something about the employee or

658
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,440
something about you they can use that

659
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,960
information against you which is why you

660
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,480
need to keep your credentials on your

661
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,240
personal information

662
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,480
private couple weeks ago

663
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,600
my fellow students and i were encouraged

664
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:27,919
to

665
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,840
fish each other and send some phishing

666
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,279
emails we did this

667
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,120
through the social engineer toolkit

668
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,720
which is incali

669
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,960
we had a really fun time the email which

670
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,120
is sent here was sent by my

671
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,559
uh by my fellow student um

672
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,480
and it was and we really had we did have

673
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,240
a good laugh i sent one to my mother as

674
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
well i'm pretending it to be from my

675
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,640
sister

676
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,320
and um and vice versa and i had

677
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,399
fun with that they but they fell for it

678
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,120
so the mitigation against fishing and

679
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,440
spear fishing is to evaluate employees

680
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,679
through its cyber risk index

681
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,880
the cri is available

682
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,399
in the references of this pdf and you're

683
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,679
you're able to skim through it yourself

684
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,200
um but basically it uh

685
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,080
it evaluates your vic your the

686
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,240
weaknesses of your employees

687
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,320
so that means you can treat employees

688
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,799
differently and train them accordingly

689
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,559
uh so because there's no use to train

690
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,159
your employees and things they already

691
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,399
know because that's just boring

692
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,200
um test them again after they have been

693
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,559
trained to see if they've learned

694
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,919
anything

695
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,880
um relaxed and fun competitions which

696
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,520

tailgating

784
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,200
oh gosh this even applies to so a couple

785
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,799
more u.s centric examples

786
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,440
sorry uh i'm a usc and so i can't help

787
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,000
myself

788
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,799
uh us army right we have the common

789
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,399
access card smart card

790
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,960
right uh i say we worked with them i'm

791
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,919
not military

792
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,240
uh has your picture on the front and

793
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,679
it's supposed to be

794
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,600
not just a piece of plastic with a

795
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,039
picture on the front it's supposed to be

796
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,120
validate the smart card aspect but

797
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,440
in practice we all know that when you

798
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,360
show up to a military base you're you

799
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,039
show them yes i have a piece of plastic

800
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,480
with my face on it and they say all

801
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,600
right come on in

802
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,760
but you don't even always need that

803
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,799
right the context

804
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,039
of i'm in a very military looking

805
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,799
vehicle and i am wearing a uniform that

806
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,480
not everybody can just you know buy a

807
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,279
uniform

808
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,480
and i totally left my cac inside i've

809
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,440
heard tales of

810
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,600
exactly that story from multiple people

811
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,440
working just like all right well i'm not

812
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,960
supposed to let you in without a cat

813
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,559
but you go right ahead i've been there

814
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,480
right so this this absolutely happens

815
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,080
even in very secure

816
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,000
environments so not all of the

817
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,360
mitigations can help

818
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,880
if there are armed guards but they don't

819
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,360
actually

820
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,679
validate that people reliably have the

821
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,960
thing that you're telling them to search

822
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,679
for so

823
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,760
this is why we test our controls

824
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,840
sometimes we refer to the offensive

825
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,960
security community as

826
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,399
glorified qa which is fair right

827
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,120
yeah it really is double check jeff i

828
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,159
could i could definitely

829
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,240
uh attest to that um having my fair

830
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,919
share of military uh

831
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,600
common access cards military college

832
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,360
person wasn't in the military i'm

833
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,679
more meet by me that was my uh that was

834
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,960
my uh military

835
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,919
so um so no definitely you have some

836
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,120
who'll check you know they'll check the

837
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,799
front in the back to say hey okay this

838
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,200
maybe

839
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,960
this may look like an actual like uh

840
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,640
common access card then it's like

841
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,000
hey you just checked the front and it's

842
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,840
like then it's like for the people in

843
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,559
the car

844
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,000
you know so you only check the driver

845
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
some bases check all four

846
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,519
you know all four people everybody in

847
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,039
the vehicle and you know

848
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,600
it depends it definitely runs the gamut

849
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
as far as um

850
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,240
like you said jeff in the us uh in the

851
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,079
united states as far as checking those

852
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,918
common access cards is i've seen the

853
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,520
ones where it's like hey look you know

854
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,239
i looked at it for almost maybe 20

855
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,639
seconds to actually see if it's legit

856
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,679
and then i was just like that okay cool

857
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,320
you know um

858
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,960
i've seen big motions on let me scroll

859
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,159
down and then flip

860
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,000
and like the actual physical uh

861
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,239
display of how they're looking at it is

862
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,639
far more intense than the actual

863
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,679
uh inspection of the card itself right

864
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,159
i am making a big deal of inspecting the

865
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,719
front

866
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,119
and now i will flip and observe the

867
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:45,839
reverse

868
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,639
side and now i authorize you you are

869
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,359
cleared for

870
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,320
takeoff or injury or whatever that

871
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,800
thank you for putting up with uh

889
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,560
technical difficulties along the way you

890
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,320
had a little bit of trial by fire

891
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,200
but you um emerged unscathed at least

892
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,680
from our perspective

893
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,720
okay great great talk man i i appreciate

894
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,440

895
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,240
it was a pleasure

896
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,320
all right but no absolutely

897
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,960
but let me uh i will briefly share since

898
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,240
i was talking about the uh

899
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,640
imposter syndrome thing before right we

900
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,280
also

901
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,160
i i suffer from imposter syndrome uh

902
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,640
often

903
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,200
as well um i think let me share my

904
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,839
screen now

905
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,480
people think that the side on the left

906
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,320
from your perspective right what i know

907
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,440
is a subset

908
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,160
of what other people know but reality is

909
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,079
we all have different sets of

910
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,320
knowledge absolutely

911
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,680
i still suffer from this today in

912
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,000
certain aspects and everything you go to

913
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,400
it's it's a common thing but honestly

914
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,440
it's one of those things you just

915
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,000
embrace

916
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,760
you know what embrace that you so you're

917
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,119
going to meet somebody who knows more

918
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:33,920
than you about

919
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
us a particular topic you know and

920
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,760
honestly ask them their advice

921
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
i found this i found people are more

922
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,359
willing to tell you and teach you what

923
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,240
they know

924
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,760
versus just you know like uh just just

925
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,359
walking in like oh man i don't even

926
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,880
belong here i don't really

927
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,480
i don't even fit in things like that it

928
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,720
happens i've been there i'm still there

929
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
i'll go to any conference and i still

930
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,240
feel like man this guy

931
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,200
no this guy he wrote the book on this

932
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
what am i even doing talking to this guy

933
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,280
you know like i need to get back in line

934
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,400
and things like that and honestly it's

935
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,599
not like that it's like hey look been

936
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,720
they've done that i still don't know

937
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,480
everything some people that helped me

938
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,240
write this book and that's the big thing

939
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,480
of beyond uh that's the big thing when

940
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,000
you're just

941
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,520
walking into anything doing any

942
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
conference uh going to any training

943
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,560
going to

944
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,400
talk to anybody you know everybody has

945
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,240
something to share everybody

946
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,119
has um everybody has something to share

947
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:25,839
and everybody

948
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,560
definitely you know has that symptom

949
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,680
everybody helps somebody

950
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,200
along the way get to where they need to

951
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,359
go so yep it has something that can help

952
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,200
others so this is one of the few

953
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,040
industries where we regularly share with

954
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,760
everybody else take advantage of that uh

955
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,160
both in terms of receiving the sharing

956
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,680
from others and also

957
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,440
helping others with your own charity

958
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
your west

959
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,800
well sorry wesley and i were talking uh

960
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,079
before things even kicked off of like

961
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,480
your unique take on a subject that has

962
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,320
been discussed many times will help

963
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,200
somebody else

964
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,280
your thought process will reverberate

965
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,720
will work nicely with others as well so

966
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,040
please continue passing on to the the

967
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
next generation as it were

968
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,000
and it's not like you you move from

969
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,640
noob to expert and there's some magical

970
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,760
transformation

971
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
i was talking with uh what uh jay beal

972
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,079
from in guardians last night about this

973
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:18,480
like

974
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,720
he turned 18 like okay i'm an adult now

975
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,400
so i'm supposed to know what to do and

976
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,800
like

977
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,839
how to adult right yeah we've just been

978
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,599
faking it this whole time buddy sorry

979
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
it's a lifelong lesson man you still

980
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,280
look you still learn stuff

981
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,320
today um you know so it's

982
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,520
and honestly like i said before it

983
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,880
doesn't have to be super technical your

984
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,240
talk doesn't have to be super typical i

985
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,760
actually gravitate to a lot of talks

986
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,320
where

987
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
how to improve security awareness or how

988
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,240
to like how to do more business

989
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,760
communications for our cyber security

990
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,520
because honestly a lot of this is just a

991
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,400
business so

992
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,160
if you have some of those softer skills

993
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,599
that you know how to

994
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,520
make a presentation or uh make a call

995
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,040
for papers or definitely know like hey

996
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,240
this is what we do in our

997
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,320
awareness program these are helpful

998
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,079
things because awareness programs are

999
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,960
very different across the scale and

1000
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,000
honestly if you have

1001
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,119
something that works and something

1002
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,200
that's been very effective share that
