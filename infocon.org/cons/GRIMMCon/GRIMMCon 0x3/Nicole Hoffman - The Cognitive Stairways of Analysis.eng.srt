1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,359
sure

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,400
oh nicole we were bragging about you an

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
hour ago

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,360
i'm here

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,039
thank you had to represent some way

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,240
so for those of you who missed us

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,680
bragging about it earlier one of the

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,199
things we talked about that we

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,199
feel that makes uh grim khan so special

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,880
is over in track two

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,760
are all of the new speakers who get

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,720
paired with coaches

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,320
and get help with their research their

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,000
presentations getting over their

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,440
imposter syndrome all the different

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,120
things you could ever worry about

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
we help with that and nicole was one of

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
our first new speakers ever

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
and has now graduated not only to giving

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,879
a talk at sans

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,200
uh but he's back here in the elite

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,760
expert track

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,879
yes the first grim con was my first talk

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,160
ever so i'm really excited i've come a

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,960
long way

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,719
and i think that's awesome of course and

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,079
you've already gone on and like i said

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,480
and

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
um given talks at other conferences and

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,320
really established to put your

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,960
fingerprint on the community

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,320
yeah and i i honestly i think i have uh

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,479
the coaches that i had and the first

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,479
grim con and the second grim con

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,479
and they just had really great advice

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,920
and and really great

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,759
um they were just really warm and

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,280
welcoming and

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
uh just boosted my confidence um

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,040
so i really fell in love with giving

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,759
back

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,600
uh with my research well we look forward

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,079
to

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,600
uh i gotta make you presenter you're

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
already a presenter uh

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
so we look forward to your talk on the

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,759
cognitive stairways of analysis

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,840
am i sharing the right screen you are

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,520
you are working

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
i love the colors blue red and purple

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,640
i'm assuming that's not an accident

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,439
um no actually i already had the colors

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,000
from

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,719
my um framework that i created and then

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,320
i just kind of wanted to match that but

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,960
then it

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,439
was perfect because it's uh it's very

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,158
unicorny

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,318
i prefer unicorn-ish as opposed opposed

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,119
to unicorn

61
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,360
yes

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
uh we'll take it away thanks

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,440
so uh once again i'm nicole hoffman and

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
i'm going to be presenting the

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,640
cognitive stairways of analysis so

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,319
a few months ago i really wanted to

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,480
give a present or i wanted to write a

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,599
blog post about

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,000
analysis and what it really means um and

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
when i started researching

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
something kind of unexpected happened i

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,280
so i want to take you on a journey of

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,920
how i unintentionally created my own

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,640
analytic framework

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,959
so a little bit more about me i am

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,160
currently a

77
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,640
an intelligence analyst at group sense

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
which is a digital risk protection

79
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,840
company

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,400
i just finished my bachelor's this month

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,159
in information technology

82
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
and i have a minor in cyber security i'm

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
security plus certified

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,200
i currently own and maintain a blog

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,400
it's accessible at threathuntergirl.com

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,239
it's been a while since i posted though

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,840
but stay tuned

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
um my passions in information security

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,680
lie

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,640
um in analysis threat hunting and risk

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,360
management

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,640
and of course research outside of work

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,080
i'm a mother of two and a huge comic

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,200
book fan as you

95
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,480
might notice some honorable mentions are

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,680
dc marvel dark horse and

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
terminal lance so i'm going to begin my

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
presentation

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,280
by discussing the topic of analysis and

100
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
going over some of the challenges that i

101
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
faced

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,400
when i started out as an analyst that

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,239
kind of led me to pursue additional

104
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,519
information

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,519
and then i'm going to go over six

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,120
analytic models

107
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
from other industries and i'm going to

108
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,840
discuss the key takeaways from each

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,200
that i used to unintentionally create my

110
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,360
own analytic framework which is

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,319
the cognitive stairways of analysis

112
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,120
currently

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,440
there are three stairways and i'm going

114
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,519
to be presenting each one

115
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,560
within this presentation and then i'm

116
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,320
going to conclude with some additional

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,360
resources

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
and helpful information

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,000
so what is analysis we see this term

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
all the time but what does it really

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,040
mean

122
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,600
how do you analyze data well

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
unfortunately when i started out in

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
infosec this is something i had to

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
figure out on my own

126
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
and i kind of assumed okay well you look

127
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,639
at the data

128
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,800
and you come to some kind of conclusion

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,199
and that worked for me for a long time

130
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,759
but i've come a long way since that day

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,240
so

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
i thought well i could take a deep dive

133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
into this topic and a blog post should

134
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,000
be easy peasy

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,320
i could grab a couple frameworks and put

136
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,520
it together and

137
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,160
give a little step-by-step process on on

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,039
how to do it

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
well when i started my research i wasn't

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,680
really happy with the results

141
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,960
i felt like a lot of life cycles and

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,320
processes just name analysis as a step

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
but they don't necessarily break it down

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,479
into additional steps

145
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,880
and so it's almost like we as a

146
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,639
community are like assuming that

147
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,400
everybody has the same definition of

148
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,080
analysis and so

149
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,800
i thought maybe because i'm specifically

150
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,520
searching

151
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,560
in the cyber realm maybe i'm limiting my

152
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,199
results

153
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,160
so i decided like my previous talk where

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,520
i took lessons from

155
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,240
a fraud i decided to why not take

156
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,680
lessons from other industries

157
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,440
specifically about analysis

158
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,840
so my research began with a white paper

159
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
and this white paper is titled a

160
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
cognitive interpretation of data

161
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,720
analysis

162
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,039
by garrett grohlman and hadley wickham

163
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,840
this white paper compares the process of

164
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,960
data analysis

165
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,919
to the process of sense making and sense

166
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,880
making

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,520
is basically how our brains make sense

168
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,039
of the world around us

169
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,479
more specifically our brain

170
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,520
creates cognitive structures

171
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,560
that represent

172
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,840
certain aspects of reality and these

173
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
structures or mental models

174
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,720
or schemas for sense making they contain

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,400
a wide range of information about a

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,039
specific

177
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,319
object or topic so when we experience

178
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,800
a new event our brain attempts to find a

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,639
relevant schema

180
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,960
and if we can't find one then it could

181
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
do one of three things

182
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
it can either update an existing schema

183
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,800
create a new schema or determine the

184
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,840
observation

185
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,000
is untrustworth as untrustworthy and

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,599
just throw it out

187
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,319
so for example the first time that you

188
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,080
experience a rainstorm

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
your brain might not understand what's

190
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
going on and it's trying to make sense

191
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,639
of it

192
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,960
um so it might collect some information

193
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
about the rainstorm

194
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,440
and then create a new schema and call it

195
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,960
rainstorm

196
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,479
so the next time you experience a

197
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
rainstorm you'll know

198
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
how to you'll your brain will know how

199
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
uh to make sense of it because you

200
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,919
already have a schema

201
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,120
but let's say this new rainstorm has

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,840
lightning and thunder well it still fits

203
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,720
with the schema

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
of rainstorm but it needs to be updated

205
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,720
with additional information that could

206
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,680
occur so you

207
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,479
can understand it so i just thought this

208
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:40,960
was

209
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,039
incredibly interesting and it kind of

210
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,080
defines to me

211
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,120
like what analysis really is and then

212
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,039
the authors

213
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,560
applied this model to exploratory and

214
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,199
confirmatory analysis

215
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,479
exploratory analysis is where

216
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,039
it begins with a data set with no

217
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,639
preconceived assumptions

218
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,240
or hypotheses about the data and then

219
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,120
you would try to create one by exploring

220
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,759
the data

221
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,800
so for example when my computer

222
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,919
is super laggy i usually

223
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,759
try to determine the cause and it

224
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,360
usually takes me about 10 minutes to

225
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,599
figure out it's a windows update

226
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,960
on the other hand confirmatory analysis

227
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,520
it begins with a hypothesis or a schema

228
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,159
in sense making and then it you attempt

229
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,399
to find relevant data to validate that

230
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,320
hypothesis or schema

231
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,120
so for example when other people's

232
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,719
windows computers are laggy

233
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,559
they probably immediately come to the

234
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
conclusion it could be an

235
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,080
update so then they could check their

236
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
updates and then can

237
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,480
confirm and validate their hypothesis so

238
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,519
my key takeaway from this

239
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,440
process was the exploratory and

240
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,800
confirmatory analysis

241
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,360
the next model that i want to go over is

242
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,040
dr christopher chatfield's statistical

243
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,000
investigation process

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
and this was published in his book and

245
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,440
it's titled

246
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
problem solving aestheticians guide

247
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
and this model is pretty straightforward

248
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,839
um

249
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
but the

250
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
main thing that i was really interested

251
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,600
in that drew me in when i first

252
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,640
found it was step three which is assess

253
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
the structure and quality of the data or

254
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
clean the data

255
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,839
and this is something that i have

256
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,920
experience doing when i

257
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,720
am querying large databases but it it

258
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,000
can be used for

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
for smaller databases as well or you

260
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,839
know only a few variables

261
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,120
but i decided that for me i actually

262
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
split this into two

263
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
steps so i split it into two key

264
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,120
takeaways the first one

265
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
is a quality of information check and

266
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,560
this is where you

267
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,440
would determine the completeness of the

268
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,399
data

269
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,560
and um really check the quality of like

270
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,079
the sources specifically

271
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,360
like if you're doing open source

272
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,279
intelligence and you're trying to

273
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,399
collect data from

274
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,560
you know open sources sometimes you're

275
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,680
going to get something that you're just

276
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
not that comfortable with

277
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
and so this is a great way to to check

278
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
that and

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
if you see any knowledge gaps or

280
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,680
something you're just not comfortable

281
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
with you can go out and

282
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
and get more data cleaning the data on

283
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,480
the other hand

284
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
is like data normalization which is

285
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,920
where

286
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680
you get rid of duplicates you kind of

287
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,519
make sure everything is in like a common

288
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,800
taxonomy

289
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,519
and you get rid of you know all the

290
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,720
stuff that you don't need that's just

291
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,880
going to cloud up your analysis

292
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,160
the second thing that i thought was

293
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
really interesting about this

294
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,880
investigation process was under the

295
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,560
select stage

296
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
i felt like this sub process took like

297
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,760
an exploratory approach to analysis

298
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,720
it begins with a data set um they look

299
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,839
at the data and then

300
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
formulate a model and

301
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,920
the author specifically states the way

302
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,040
that he does this

303
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,440
is something called regression analysis

304
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,680
and regression analysis is where

305
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,839
you have two or more variables that

306
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,920
you're trying to find a relationship

307
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,880
between or like an underlying structure

308
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,240
so for example

309
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
if you remember back in grade school we

310
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,519
used to get those

311
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,640
uh number patterns similar

312
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,920
to this 2 4 6 8 10. if you and it says

313
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,880
find the pattern

314
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,079
that is in this set of numbers if you

315
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,200
have one like this

316
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
it's you could probably immediately come

317
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
to the conclusion

318
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,079
that it's just adding two each time and

319
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,240
however if you have something like 28 20

320
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,279
13 7 2 you may need to explore your

321
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
options to determine the relationship

322
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,640
between these numbers

323
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,959
to me this is sometimes a cyclical

324
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,240
process because

325
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
you're not always going to create or

326
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,680
you're not always going to have the

327
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,839
right hypothesis on the first time

328
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
you might say okay well 28 minus

329
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,560
8 is or 28 minus 20 is 8

330
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
okay so maybe it's subtracting 8 each

331
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
time well no that doesn't fit

332
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,040
so the data doesn't fit my model so i'd

333
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,800
have to create a new one so i could you

334
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
know then assume

335
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,560
maybe it's being subtracted by one each

336
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,279
time

337
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,959
and then i can check the fit of that

338
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,639
data to

339
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,480
my model and that's kind of the process

340
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
that's going so i took regression

341
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,240
analysis as a key takeaway because i

342
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,519
just thought that was really interesting

343
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,399
it kind of

344
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
expanded upon the idea of exploratory

345
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,560
analysis

346
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,399
the next model is the model of operation

347
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,560
of police operational intelligence

348
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
analysis

349
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,560
and i got this one from a white paper as

350
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,040
well

351
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,160
and it's titled how analysts think think

352
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
steps as a tool for structuring sense

353
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,120
making

354
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,839
and criminal intelligence analysis i

355
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,440
don't want to butcher the names but i

356
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
did list them

357
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,079
this is one of the favorite my favorite

358
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,519
analysis models that i found

359
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,959
specifically because

360
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,079
it breaks this step of analysis

361
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,480
into additional steps which is really

362
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,440
interesting

363
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,120
so this process begins with a briefing

364
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
from an investigator the criminal

365
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
analyst would then

366
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,600
establish think steps think steps

367
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
provide a template that enable an

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,040
analyst to approach the case decompose

369
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,440
it into separate elements and classify

370
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,720
associated data accordingly and then

371
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,240
they could do some

372
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
they could request some information do

373
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,560
some background research structure the

374
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,440
data

375
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,920
before querying the database and

376
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
schematizing the data

377
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,839
and then trying to recreate the path of

378
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,959
the criminal

379
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,920
and then communicating the results so in

380
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,079
other words the criminal analysts

381
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,360
are attempting to choose a schema or

382
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,160
multiple schemas to match the data to

383
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,199
and for a criminal analyst the schemas

384
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,560
are crimes such as

385
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,279
murder burglary and human trafficking

386
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,079
each crime

387
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,199
has its own set of think steps and in

388
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,720
information security

389
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,279
each type of malware or cyber attack is

390
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,120
going to have its own set of think steps

391
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
associated with their analysis

392
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,160
so my key takeaway is think steps

393
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,079
and i honestly think that this is one of

394
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,079
the best pieces of analytical advice

395
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,360
i've ever received

396
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,120
and if you could take anything away from

397
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,360
this presentation i hope that it can be

398
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,120
think steps because it could save us a

399
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,519
lot of time and assist in training as

400
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
well

401
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,880
this model is from an article titled the

402
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
business analytic model life cycle

403
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,480
and it's by michael coveny and

404
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,000
there's a lot of different models that i

405
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,880
found in business analysis

406
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,000
but i really liked this one because

407
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,519
it reminded me of

408
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,760
step three and four kind of reminded me

409
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,360
of the process of sense making how

410
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,000
you're

411
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,560
modeling the data and then adapting the

412
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,920
model

413
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,880
and then it kind of reminded me step 6

414
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,720
kind of reminded me of

415
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,920
cyber security policy like when you're

416
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,519
trying to monitor the performance of a

417
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,040
policy

418
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,480
so for example so let's say

419
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,600
you um

420
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
you're a policy maker and you believe

421
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,959
that the only way that you can get

422
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
malware is from a phishing email

423
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,639
and so that's kind of inside your

424
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,320
cognitive schema

425
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,240
you believe the cause of malware is a

426
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,399
phishing email well let's say one day

427
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,079
you experience a malware event

428
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,399
but it's actually caused by a malicious

429
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,079
toolbar that was downloaded

430
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,240
well it still fits within your schema of

431
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,480
malware but you just need to adapt

432
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,839
your model or update it and then you can

433
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,120
use that model

434
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
for planning or you can update any cyber

435
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,720
security policies

436
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
or security controls based on your

437
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,680
updated cognitive model

438
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,480
and then you can monitor the performance

439
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,440
um

440
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,279
and depending on your organization an

441
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
analyst isn't always going to be the one

442
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,120
monitoring the performance of a control

443
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,279
or security policy or even writing them

444
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,920
so i didn't end up taking this away from

445
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,759
for my framework but i thought it was an

446
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,720
honorable mention

447
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,199
for those of you that are creating and

448
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,199
determining the effectiveness of cyber

449
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,120
security policies

450
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,519
my key takeaway was actually step one

451
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,959
which is to find what is being

452
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,079
investigated

453
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,399
and i took this away as determining the

454
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,120
scope

455
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
and i know a lot of other models have a

456
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,959
similar step

457
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,800
but i think it was because this one used

458
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,240
the word define

459
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,560
it kind of reminded me of threat hunting

460
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,279
and when you're

461
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,519
threat hunting you have to define a

462
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,800
specific goal

463
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,079
or hypotheses otherwise if you're too

464
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,920
broad you'll have too much data

465
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
and if you're if you just don't set a

466
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,199
scope at all

467
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,600
then you could just you know chase the

468
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,560
shiny things and

469
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,680
nobody has time for that

470
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,720
so i started my career actually in the

471
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,639
medical field before hopping into

472
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,560
um financial and then into infosec so

473
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
i wanted to uh include a medical model i

474
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,280
thought it would be really interesting

475
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,599
and i thought i had a lot of um

476
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
assumptions on what it would look like

477
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,880
and how it could be similar to the

478
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
process of sense making

479
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,679
and this particular model i i've it's

480
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,520
called the medical diagnostic

481
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,799
process model and it's from a textbook

482
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,439
called improving diagnosis in health

483
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,160
care

484
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,000
and i listed the uh all of the authors

485
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,280
below

486
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,360
this was the first model that took a

487
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,480
cyclical approach

488
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,799
to collection and to the collection and

489
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,480
analysis phase that i

490
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,520
uh found and

491
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,919
this phase also includes you know

492
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,440
collecting information

493
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,720
from the patient and then being able to

494
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,559
translate that into medical terminology

495
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,520
and then creating a working diagnosis

496
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,080
one of the more exciting elements though

497
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,880
about this

498
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,320
model is that the doctors

499
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
get to do a physical examination of a

500
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,000
patient and

501
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,840
they can collect as much information as

502
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,280
they want verbally

503
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,200
but the physical examination is going to

504
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,799
provide a plethora of information that

505
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,400
they just wouldn't otherwise be able to

506
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,200
obtain

507
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,559
and infosec is really no different um if

508
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,160
you're a managed service provider

509
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,960
and and you get a case from a client you

510
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,520
only get like a small screenshot and so

511
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
you don't necessarily always get the

512
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,280
chance to do a physical examination so

513
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,720
this is why it's important to

514
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
create the think steps so you know all

515
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,039
the questions to ask

516
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,160
so you can provide the best analysis my

517
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,360
key takeaway

518
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,520
from this model was actually the

519
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,200
communication of the diagnosis

520
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,360
i thought the the way that intelligence

521
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,039
analysts

522
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,120
excuse me communicate our findings

523
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,039
it's more than just explaining it is a

524
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,400
communication

525
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,600
and sometimes i have to communicate

526
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
my findings to multiple people with

527
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,120
varying levels

528
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,600
of technical knowledge and similar to a

529
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,120
doctor so i thought that was

530
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
really interesting so i took that away

531
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,520
from this model

532
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,880
so i'm a huge fan of meteorology when i

533
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,480
was little

534
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,200
i actually wanted to be a meteorologist

535
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,000
but

536
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
then i found out i'm really really

537
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,080
really bad at math

538
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,080
and there's a lot of math in meteorology

539
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,799
so i had to kind of squeeze in a model

540
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,720
from this

541
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,840
field so the model i found

542
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,280
is from a white paper and it's called

543
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
optimization of a heterogeneous

544
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,360
simulations

545
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,679
uh workflow and i listed the authors

546
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,160
again um

547
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,520
the process is actually a workflow

548
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,440
and not you know an analytic process but

549
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
it kind of gives us a glimpse of the

550
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
type of analysis that occurs in the

551
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
forecasting process

552
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,760
um my key takeaway was actually the

553
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,159
first

554
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,760
step which i thought was really

555
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,280
interesting because this is the first

556
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,840
model

557
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,480
that i saw that establishes an

558
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,840
environment

559
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,120
which i thought was really interesting

560
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,600
because in information security you know

561
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,440
when we're about to when we get a case

562
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,200
or you know we have to do some kind of

563
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,000
analysis we have to understand

564
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,280
you know where the problem exists um

565
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
you know for example if you know becky

566
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,799
in accounting

567
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,000
is experiencing a phishing email attack

568
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
you don't necessarily want to you know

569
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,840
collect email headers from the ceo

570
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,280
that's not going to go over well so

571
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,120
i feel like this kind of expands upon

572
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,799
determining the scope

573
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,880
so i think it's really interesting the

574
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,840
other thing i thought was really

575
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,600
interesting that's not necessarily a key

576
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,400
takeaway

577
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,559
is the subjective interpretation by a

578
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,080
meteorologist

579
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
i feel like this is kind of an

580
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,360
additional layer of confirmatory

581
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,919
analysis with like another set of eyes

582
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,120
and i thought that was really

583
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,400
interesting and something that could

584
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
potentially be useful

585
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,600
in another stairway in the future

586
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,559
and so yeah so i just love that

587
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,360
so throughout my research i learned so

588
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,919
much

589
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,760
and found so many great models um

590
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,679
but i kind of felt like when i was done

591
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,320
that i was left wanting more

592
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,760
and i felt like the puzzle was

593
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,000
incomplete and so i thought

594
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,760
well what if i take away all of my

595
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,320
favorite parts and kind of just put them

596
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,960
in like a list for my blog post so that

597
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,640
people can see like all the great ones

598
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,760
but then i decided

599
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
well why not just make it a step-by-step

600
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,360
process and then i

601
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
realized did i just create my own

602
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,559
framework

603
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,200
or you know process and so of course i

604
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,480
had to give it a name

605
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,039
so i named it the cognitive stairways of

606
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,320
analysis

607
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,880
and when i say stairway i'm merely just

608
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,840
relating a step-by-step process

609
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,480
to a stairway and there are some

610
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,200
optionable

611
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,880
or optional cycles in the stairway

612
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,720
but there's always going to be an end

613
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,120
goal which is dissemination and

614
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
there are currently like i said three

615
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
stairways based on certain starting

616
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,799
points that you might experience in

617
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
information security

618
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,360
i'm hoping to create additional

619
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,039
stairways in the future and i

620
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,799
implore others to contribute to this

621
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,159
framework

622
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,440
my original goal was to have all this

623
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,520
information available on github

624
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,320
but then i realized github's kind of a

625
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,760
alert there's kind of a learning curve

626
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,039
with github so

627
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,880
we'll see what happens with that but i

628
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
do have

629
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,120
all of the things that i went over as

630
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,960
well as some additional frameworks

631
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,880
listed in the blog post that i did end

632
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,720
up creating

633
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,919
um so without further ado let's just get

634
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,840
right into it

635
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,039
so the first cognitive stairway

636
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,720
begins with an alert and this alert

637
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,919
can come from a security tool or by word

638
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,799
of mouth

639
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,720
but basically you're given a potential

640
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
problem to solve

641
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,080
next you need to determine the scope

642
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,039
and this includes you know identifying

643
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,799
the end goal of your analysis and

644
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,679
understanding the

645
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,880
environment that the problem existed

646
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
step three is where you can begin

647
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,880
compiling your data once you know

648
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,039
you know what your data sources is or

649
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,039
are and and where the problem exists you

650
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,960
can start compiling the data

651
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,039
and this is where you can also do that

652
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,200
quality of information check

653
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,320
and this is where you're going to want

654
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
to check the completeness of your data

655
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,200
the quality of the data is does it look

656
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
trustworthy

657
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,039
things like that and if you see any

658
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,960
knowledge gaps then you might need to

659
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,559
compile some additional data

660
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,039
step four is where you're going to clean

661
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,919
the data

662
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,360
and remember this is um basically data

663
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,559
normalization

664
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,760
and this is where you're gonna put the

665
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,400
data into a common taxonomy so it just

666
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,480
makes it easier for analyzing

667
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,640
and when i say common taxonomy i just

668
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,559
mean like everything's the same

669
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,480
like if you have a field that says like

670
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,679
san diego

671
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,080
and there's eight people in your office

672
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
and all every eight of you write it

673
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,240
differently

674
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
when you go to query a database you

675
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,720
might not get all of the correct fields

676
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,480
and it and it doesn't really matter when

677
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,559
you have you know five or six variables

678
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,679
but when you're

679
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,000
analyzing you know hundreds or thousands

680
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,080
of variables it makes a huge difference

681
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,240
and you can end up not having a complete

682
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,760
picture and you can have information

683
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,320
gaps

684
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,520
just because there's not a common

685
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,320
taxonomy this is also the time

686
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,159
to get rid of all the data you don't

687
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,200
need if there's any additional data

688
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,760
um that's just clouding up your analysis

689
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,520
just get rid of it because

690
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,200
you you want it to be as clean as

691
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,279
possible so that it makes the analysis

692
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,120
better step five is where you could

693
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
begin your

694
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,240
exploratory data analysis or eda

695
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,200
um everyone kind of does this

696
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,880
differently

697
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
and it really depends on what the

698
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,000
problem is

699
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,080
and what the data looks like this could

700
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,760
be looking at a spread

701
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,440
putting the data in a spreadsheet it

702
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,520
could be looking through logs

703
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,400
um or you know you could also visualize

704
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,200
the data

705
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
how whatever helps you explore the data

706
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,919
the best and this is also the time for

707
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,600
regression analysis

708
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,440
and this is where you're trying to find

709
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
as you're exploring the data you're

710
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,760
trying to find an

711
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,159
underlying structure or relationship

712
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
between the variables

713
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
and then step six you can create your or

714
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,039
generate your hypothesis

715
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,480
or multiple hypotheses and create

716
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,840
think steps for each one and remember

717
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,320
the think steps there are a template

718
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,039
that

719
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
enables the analyst to approach the case

720
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,760
decompose it into separate elements

721
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
and then classify the data accordingly

722
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,880
because you're trying

723
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,760
to match the data to your hypothesis or

724
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,360
schema

725
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,279
and then step seven is confirmatory

726
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,799
analysis and that's where you're fitting

727
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,520
the model

728
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,480
to your hypothesis with your think steps

729
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,279
and

730
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,159
if you find any discrepancies that um

731
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:20,559
that

732
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,640
don't fit either with the model or the

733
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,760
hypoth or the

734
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,360
data you can optionally go back to

735
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,240
exploratory analysis and continue

736
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,520
searching for anything you might have

737
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,159
missed

738
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,159
and then generate a new hypothesis with

739
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,279
think steps or just

740
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,520
update your hypothesis it really just

741
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,679
depends on the data and the issue

742
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,720
and after you confirm uh your findings

743
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,360
you can

744
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,840
move on to dissemination and

745
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,520
dissemination is really the most

746
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
important step in the stairway

747
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,279
because if you if you don't have it

748
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,120
otherwise your all of your analysis was

749
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,080
for nothing

750
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,840
and the dissemination can be in the form

751
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,320
of written or oral communication so the

752
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,000
second stairway of analysis

753
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,440
begins with a brainstorming session

754
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,720
and this could be that you're um

755
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
it could be an organized event that

756
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,919
you're brainstorming or that you decide

757
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,960
to brainstorm

758
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,919
and create a hypothesis maybe before a

759
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:22,720
hunt

760
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,080
um or this is also the time

761
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,880
um if like if your sizzo or manager ever

762
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,200
asks you like hey i saw this new threat

763
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
or exploit on the news do you think

764
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,799
we're susceptible to it

765
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,720
well this is the stairway for those

766
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,080
scenarios as well

767
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,520
because most likely you're going to have

768
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,679
to do some form of brainstorming

769
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,679
to try to determine the likelihood that

770
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,840
that could affect you

771
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,919
and if you do think you're susceptible

772
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,600
you know that that's when you can

773
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
generate hypotheses

774
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,000
or a single hypothesis and then generate

775
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
those think steps

776
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
and remember those are the template that

777
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,240
help you classify the case

778
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
and then you can determine the scope of

779
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,760
the investigation

780
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,559
and you can determine um this includes

781
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,919
understanding the environment and

782
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,480
setting an

783
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,799
end goal that's specific

784
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,240
and step three is the

785
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,600
key assumptions check or kac for short

786
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,240
and the key assumptions check um this is

787
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,919
an analysis technique where you can

788
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,600
write down all of your assumptions

789
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,399
about any given uh topic to determine

790
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,000
the likelihood that the

791
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,159
your assumptions are true or not true

792
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,919
and this is a great way to flesh out any

793
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,240
biases that you may have about a

794
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,360
specific topic or your hypothesis

795
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,760
this is also a great time for devil's

796
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,559
advocate

797
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,279
which is another uh analysis technique

798
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,840
where you try to attempt or you

799
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,640
i'm talking too fast for my brain you

800
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,360
attempt

801
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,720
to think of any possible alternatives

802
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,640
to the topic and anything that uh

803
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,720
would would uh go against it and then

804
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,919
you and you try and

805
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,600
uh determine that step four is

806
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,480
um again compiling the data once you

807
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,039
know

808
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,960
what your data sources are you've

809
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,720
flushed out all your biases

810
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,640
and then you can check the quality of

811
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,679
your data as well as the data sources

812
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,640
to make sure that you're really

813
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,720
comfortable and confident with your

814
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,840
findings

815
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,399
and then you can clean the data emit

816
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,000
anything that's useless get rid of

817
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,399
duplicates common taxonomy

818
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,720
and then the stairway can go one of two

819
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,440
ways

820
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,039
because you already generated your

821
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,440
hypotheses and think steps you don't

822
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,760
have to explore the data however

823
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,360
some people like to do this i know i

824
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,120
personally do i like to just make sure

825
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,559
that i didn't miss anything

826
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,480
and this is really a case-by-case basis

827
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,919
sometimes

828
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,279
you will just know that you don't need

829
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,080
to explore it

830
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,480
and so i put that in there as an option

831
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,799
um in the event that you find something

832
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
during your exploratory analysis and

833
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,399
regression analysis

834
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,159
you can go back optionally to

835
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,120
step one and generate a new hypothesis a

836
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,000
hypothesis

837
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,679
or you can just update it if you need to

838
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,120
and then you can either go back through

839
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,279
the steps if you need to or you can just

840
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,960
go straight on to step seven

841
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,360
which is confirmatory analysis and this

842
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,520
is where you're validating

843
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,679
your hypothesis and then step eight of

844
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,120
course is dissemination

845
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,039
so cognitive stairway number three

846
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,799
is similar to the first two but it

847
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,320
begins a little bit differently

848
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,840
so it can actually begin in two

849
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,000
different ways the first one

850
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,960
is it can begin by determining the scope

851
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
of a red team analysis

852
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,600
or it can begin straight with the red

853
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,279
team analysis without determining the

854
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:47,919
scope

855
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,320
and a red team analysis is basically

856
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,679
where you put yourself

857
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,640
in the attacker's shoes and try to um

858
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,240
when you're looking at a problem you put

859
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,080
yourself in the attacker's shoes

860
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,360
and which kind of leads you to a

861
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,960
hypothesis of how you would approach

862
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,440
this

863
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,120
this uh situation and sometimes it might

864
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,519
be

865
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,679
you know you you're wanting to look at

866
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,960
uh you know

867
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,720
how vulnerable a certain asset is in

868
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,320
your environment and this is kind of

869
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,000
when you would determine the scope ahead

870
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,519
of time before you do the red team

871
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,399
analysis

872
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,559
but sometimes you're just you know

873
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,320
browsing your environment and you see

874
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,600
something that you're just not

875
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,760
comfortable with and you think i wonder

876
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,440
if i can exploit that

877
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,960
and if you're in information security

878
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,720
long enough it happens more times than

879
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,159
not

880
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
but and then after you do the red team

881
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,600
analysis you can then generate your

882
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,399
hypothesis

883
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,760
and your think steps and

884
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,519
compile the data that you need and then

885
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,360
do that quality of information check as

886
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,640
well as check the quality of your

887
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,519
sources

888
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,440
clean the data get rid of the useless

889
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,039
data and then

890
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,720
optionally just like in the stairway

891
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,960
number two you can explore the data to

892
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,480
look for any discrepancies that you

893
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
didn't think about

894
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,240
during your red team analysis and then

895
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,080
you can move on to step

896
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,159
uh seven which is the confirmatory

897
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,679
analysis where you're

898
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,159
confirming and validating your

899
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,080
hypothesis to your data

900
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,440
um and then of course step eight

901
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,480
is dissemination

902
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,559
so i went over a lot of different terms

903
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,559
so i included a glossary

904
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,399
of terms and i'm going to make my

905
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,519
slides available after the talk and of

906
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,039
course my resources

907
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,480
and i did of course like i said i did

908
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,039
look through

909
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,960
a lot more um analysis models and

910
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,760
processes

911
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,880
that i included in my model or my blog

912
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,000
which i have available so i really hope

913
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
that you guys liked my presentation

914
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,480
i hope that the cognitive stairways can

915
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,120
assist

916
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,200
other analysts when they're analyzing

917
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,399
data and

918
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,240
again right now there's only three but

919
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,159
i'm hoping to expand

920
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,600
this framework into additional um

921
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
stairways maybe doing like an osit

922
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
specific maybe doing an incident

923
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,159
response one there's so many ideas

924
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,039
so i implore others to help out and

925
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,158
contribute to the framework

926
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
so you just mentioned a couple of

927
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,080
verticals that you plan on expanding

928
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,960
this into

929
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,120
um i think that's a really neat to kind

930
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,240
of take what is a broad framework of

931
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,120
intellectual analytics and now start to

932
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,720
figure out well how do i apply them

933
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,919
specifically in

934
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,960
particular technical verticals

935
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,080
yes and i think specifically like if i

936
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,240
did like an incident response specific

937
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
and not necessarily like an intelligence

938
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,600
one like i i

939
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,760
modeled mine i could do i can add in

940
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,600
like the treatment plan from the

941
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,519
medical one or the monitoring the model

942
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,880
performance or even

943
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,679
creating a you know a cyber security

944
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,159
policy

945
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,600
one for that process

946
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
and i think that ties back to

947
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
catherine's talk where she was coming up

948
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,080
with

949
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,760
different ways for us to talk to the

950
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,120
non-technical crowd

951
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,760
is i mean that's a core component of

952
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,320
that

953
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,480
and these different frameworks are also

954
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,440
a different way to look at that

955
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,639
information from

956
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,560
that those different and then shared

957
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,639
perspectives

958
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,480
yes that's very true and i actually

959
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,760
thought about

960
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
if i'm breaking down the steps of

961
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,839
analysis why not

962
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,520
also break down the step of

963
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,119
dissemination

964
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,000
and how you know it could you could not

965
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,639
only

966
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,399
disseminate to different teams in your

967
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,399
with internally but also externally

968
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,119
and you know executives versus technical

969
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,480
and stuff like that so that's

970
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,359
gives me a great idea and i think the

971
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,520
dissemination point is probably

972
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,440
the most critical point in the way we

973
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,320
frame that or how we communicate that

974
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,480
takes all those other steps and that's

975
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,079
the the key reason that we're actually

976
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,918
doing the analysis right

977
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,000
exactly that's the most important step

978
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,679
otherwise all of your analysis

979
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,480
is kind of useless or i mean it's always

980
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,040
practice

981
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
but you always want to have those

982
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,839
actionable results

983
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,480
are there are there tools that you

984
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,839
recommend that help underpin this

985
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,000
um i think it really depends i i wanted

986
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,520
to make it really broad

987
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,200
so that a number of different

988
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,040
individuals in infosec can use it

989
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,800
so it's not super specific but i'm

990
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,560
hoping in the future to kind of make it

991
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,440
a little bit more specific

992
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,400
but if there's any questions about

993
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
anything like any specific step

994
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,280
and you're wondering how to do it if

995
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,720
you're looking for tools i i'm sure i

996
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,480
can answer them

997
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,800
my go-to is excel because it's the

998
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,839
mother of all tools

999
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,839
excel is the most common security tool

1000
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,400
everywhere it is

1001
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,599
it's the best thing i love it there's

1002
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,839
nothing it can't do

1003
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,200
followed by powerpoint and then

1004
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,880
microsoft word

1005
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,240
it's true it's very true the microsoft

1006
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,160
word for those you at home was a is the

1007
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,640
fact you have to write a report

1008
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,599
yes the dissemination of information the

1009
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,000
most critical part

1010
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,200
exactly yes that and

1011
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,440
yes and it keeps making me think maybe i

1012
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,640
should break that down into an

1013
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,680
additional thing but

1014
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,960
i could talk about this forever

1015
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,680
it's very useful there's a lot there and

1016
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,760
i think if you continue this work like

1017
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,119
there's a lot that can be gained from it

1018
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,359
oh i was just saying i i hope it could

1019
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,280
be useful

1020
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,560
so how does that how does your current

1021
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,640
workplace look at uh these

1022
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,078
uh cognitive steps

1023
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,079
um i mean i think um

1024
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,079
they're they're being introduced to the

1025
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,680
cognitive steps

1026
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,440
during this presentation as well they're

1027
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,760
all watching so i'm hoping we can apply

1028
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,240
them

1029
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,760
um to our own intelligence analysis and

1030
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,800
a lot of the uh the ways that i applied

1031
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,200
the

1032
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,640
the the processes that i

1033
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,880
i researched is it has to do with my own

1034
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,160
personal experiences

1035
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,040
so um i think it definitely helps me

1036
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,000
every day i

1037
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,240
actually have the cognitive stairways on

1038
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,040
my wall

1039
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,720
um when i'm going through a process i

1040
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,400
want to make sure i'm not forgetting a

1041
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,200
step or

1042
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
flushing out those biases and stuff like

1043
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,439
that

1044
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,480
how did you full color a poster print is

1045
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,520
what you're saying you're going to come

1046
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
out with next

1047
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,800
that would actually be really cool um

1048
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,839
maybe we'll see i already have stickers

1049
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,359
on my

1050
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,480
on my website so maybe i'll do a

1051
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,000
prints or something maybe if i get 12 we

1052
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,480
can do

1053
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,040
a calendar

1054
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,480
i like it

1055
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,000
so how did you first start down this

1056
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,480
path i mean what was the catalyst that

1057
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,520
where you were like you know this is

1058
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,480
something i need to codify

1059
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,640
so i i started with a i just wanted to

1060
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,960
do a blog post and i thought well

1061
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,800
um i had a couple different topics and

1062
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,480
i'm like well let's just do a deep dive

1063
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,400
into analysis because i just

1064
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,800
i kept seeing analysis as a step in

1065
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,040
different frameworks and processes

1066
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,119
and i thought you know why not break it

1067
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,960
down and i thought it would be

1068
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,359
easy to do i thought it'd be oh just you

1069
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,040
know grab a couple frameworks and be

1070
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,920
done

1071
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,760
and that just wasn't the case and then

1072
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,440
you know after i

1073
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,160
found all of the specific types of

1074
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,680
analysis and i made the list

1075
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
i thought well instead of just making a

1076
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,599
list why not make it a process and put

1077
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,599
them in order and then i was like

1078
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,720
did i just create a framework and so it

1079
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,880
was completely unintentional

1080
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,960
but i'm really really really proud of

1081
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,520
the results

1082
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,400
well again congratulations on graduating

1083
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,320
with your bachelor's degree but

1084
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,839
i'd like to point out that a lot of the

1085
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,359
work that you're doing here leads

1086
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,640
directly into a thesis yes

1087
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,320
actually um this is

1088
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,359
this may or may not be a part of that

1089
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,300
said thesis

1090
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,400
[Laughter]

1091
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,760
oh you've got other ideas maybe um i

1092
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
know i'm not i'm done with school but

1093
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,200
um i have some additional ideas as far

1094
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,720
as publications and

1095
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,279
so forth

1096
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,280
all right nicole well we look forward to

1097
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,079
reading the book when it comes out

1098
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,920
that's what i was going to say i'll send

1099
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,800
you the first copy

1100
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,400
i like this you got all the way from

1101
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,160
this is the first talk i've ever given

1102
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,040
and that was uh

1103
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,000
at the in the spring to now we're we're

1104
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,119
at the cusp of

1105
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,240
writing and publishing a book yes

1106
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,598
and i have grim con to think

1107
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,160
well i i i'm glad that we have been a

1108
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,280
part of your journey

1109
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,079
uh on uh your professional career

1110
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,200
development and

1111
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,440
if you do really uh write a book and uh

1112
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,359
us egging you on helps make that happen

1113
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,000
then

1114
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,200
we are more than happy to do it yes well

1115
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,880
i could say without a doubt

1116
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,160
that uh grim con has made 2020 a lot

1117
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,880
brighter

1118
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,920
for a lot of people

1119
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,760
thank you that's uh i think the best

1120
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,359
compliment we can get

1121
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,200
so the question we've been asking all of

1122
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,040
our uh guests

1123
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,880
today has been predictions for 2021

1124
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,680
and the one on everyone's mind always is

1125
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,839
at the as we do these end of years is

1126
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,920
what do you think is going to be

1127
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,240
a change in the threat landscape in 2021

1128
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,359
um well i mean after uh

1129
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,119
you know that release of the source code

1130
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,359
of cobalt strike

1131
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,760
i definitely see a huge surge in

1132
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,640
ransomware

1133
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,560
and i think that's that's only going to

1134
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,160
pick up speed i think that they're going

1135
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,240
to continue to get more creative

1136
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,440
and it's going to be a massive problem

1137
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,280
that we're going to have to

1138
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,160
deal with so i think that is going to

1139
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,920
continue to be the number one

1140
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,680
threat in 2021

1141
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,160
tyler that sounds a lot like what you

1142
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,560
were saying earlier

1143
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,359
yeah that is that's very similar and i

1144
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,200
don't think you're you're far off

1145
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
uh and not just cobalt strike right like

1146
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,119
a couple strikes a java application it's

1147
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,440
been reversed several times like

1148
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,319
the year of the c2 was last year and

1149
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,599
that was a

1150
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,079
large amount of good frameworks that

1151
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,040
have

1152
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,240
very similar capabilities so the ease of

1153
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,960
being able to be a

1154
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,040
semi-sophisticated adversary with

1155
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,440
a commodity tools is now so it will

1156
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,400
become

1157
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
much more prevalent and they will be

1158
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,160
abused moving forward

1159
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,560
like we've seen uh i think the gap

1160
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
between the script kitty

1161
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,680
and the um sophisticated adversary is

1162
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,560
going to become bigger

1163
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,319
and the gap between companies doing

1164
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,760
security right

1165
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,359
and companies that are getting left

1166
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,119
behind is going to be greater and

1167
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,960
greater

1168
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,560
i hope so those who haven't

1169
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,400
start doing uh george and i

1170
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,520
um coming from a lunch conversation

1171
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,480
at the last derby con we pushed out in a

1172
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,599
a concept called

1173
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,119
the c2 matrix the c2matrix.com

1174
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,000
and we wanted a compendium to catalog

1175
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,760
all of the c2s that were

1176
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,680
publicly available whether they are

1177
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,520
purchasable or whether they're open

1178
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,800
source

1179
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,960
and when we first started we initially

1180
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,800
had a list of 23 of them

1181
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,839
and we're over 60 now

1182
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,160
that's how many are out there and

1183
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,240
available and uh to help folks at home

1184
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,079
we also provide a decision matrix on how

1185
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,560
to use which ones for certain purposes

1186
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,400
there are defensive components there so

1187
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,599
we are

1188
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,960
generating artifacts to be able to

1189
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,200
defend against them and then we also

1190
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,800
include a couple of

1191
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,359
uh vms that already have a lot of these

1192
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,880
things installed so

1193
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,520
you can get started from day one because

1194
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,119
uh some of them the first challenge is

1195
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,000
just getting the thing

1196
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,079
to actually install the package

1197
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,079
that's pretty awesome i think that's

1198
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,760
highly useful um

1199
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,359
from a tracking standpoint just keeping

1200
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,880
it up like

1201
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,119
i thought i knew a lot of them and i get

1202
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,119
on that list and there's someone like

1203
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,640
when did that come out and how did when

1204
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,319
did they get that capability like

1205
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,119
there's a

1206
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,960
continual adaptation and there's a lot

1207
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,200
of groups pushing stuff so

1208
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,640
yeah a lot of innovation happening in

1209
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,240
the community there um and

1210
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,920
so it's been really interesting also

1211
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,280
seeing which languages become

1212
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
popular and watching those grow and

1213
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,359
we're not even talking about like a a

1214
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,359
multi-year view here this is a one-year

1215
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,040
view seeing the shift in the

1216
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,800
conversation where the innovation is

1217
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,440
coming

1218
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,800
what new frameworks are coming to the

1219
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,160
table and why they're coming to the

1220
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,720
table

1221
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,400
all time back to your prediction there

1222
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,000
nicole which is i think that

1223
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,160
commoditized available

1224
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,359
offensive tooling is going to continue

1225
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,520
to

1226
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,280
be seen quite a lot

1227
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,319
definitely yeah i think that there's um

1228
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,640
you know that it's a huge threat when

1229
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,119
someone that has no technical um they're

1230
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,400
not in the technical field

1231
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,240
everybody that you that i can talk to

1232
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,440
all my neighbors they all know what

1233
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,200
ransomware is

1234
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,880
and so that's kind of how you know that

1235
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,480
it's it's a definitely

1236
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,440
a big threat

1237
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,280
yes it is i think it's going to be an

1238
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,000
interesting

1239
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
2021 2020 was a sucky year but there was

1240
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,280
a lot of uh things that happened so it

1241
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:27,680
kind of

1242
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,560
sets up a an interesting dichotomy for

1243
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,079
2021.

1244
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,599
have you ever walked into a year but

1245
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,319
like this is going to be the boring gear

1246
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,400
nobody ever comes in like well this year

1247
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,520
and what's going to be different about

1248
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,160
it is

1249
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,000
nothing's going to happen it's going to

1250
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
be boring it's going to be calm

1251
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,760
it'll be peaceful there'll be no

1252
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,240
surprises

1253
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,300
i don't know if that's true

1254
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,960
[Laughter]

1255
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,760
it's never going to be the case no this

1256
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,040
is true

1257
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,319
especially in the age we live

1258
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,319
but that's all the more important to get

1259
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,760
your analysis right and i think the the

1260
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,520
framework that that you just

1261
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,920
kind of displayed is a great especially

1262
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,359
for those that have analytical minds

1263
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,119
which is a lot of us

1264
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,960
having that kind of framework to follow

1265
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,200
and really breaking down

1266
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,359
the pie in the sky it's always better to

1267
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,200
keep breaking those components down yeah

1268
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:19,520
it's

1269
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,200
just analysis but what happens in

1270
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,880
analysis how you do an analysis right

1271
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,960
like those components that's a

1272
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,040
that's something i haven't seen a lot of

1273
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,079
and i think that's really

1274
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,839
really cool that you did that thank you

1275
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,599
all right well nicole great to see you

1276
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,119
again

1277
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,880
as always thanks for having me i'm

1278
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,960
honored

1279
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,640
and uh thank you for your kind

1280
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,359
compliments on uh grim con for the year

1281
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,560
uh we wish you a wonderful 2021 which

1282
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,240
according to tyler is going to be

1283
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,200
easy and boring yes super boring

1284
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,720
to a grim column 4. we'll see you

1285
