1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,720
oh

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
uh don't make fun of people for what

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,080
they don't know all right

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,760
everything that everybody knows by the

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,360
time they're adults it means that

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,360
there's 10 000 people in the us hearing

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,880
about it for the first time

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,680
every day right just do the math if you

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,439
go from never knowing about it to

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,840
100 i've heard about it by 30 out of 4

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,119
million people

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,439
born per year it's a 10 000 people who

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,560
haven't heard of that

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,400
thing and of course as you get more and

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,160
more particular about uh

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
dn spy any dot run was an offhand

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,920
mention but a

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,719
really powerful thing what is that right

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,480
i love it

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,559
hand it malware it'll tell you what it

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,640
does in their sandbox environment

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,079
so let's hunt okay register

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,559
upload malware receive report of what it

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,280
does

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
all right there's you can do more in

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
your own sock and have your own custom

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
environment

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
but to get started takes registering

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
with an email address that's not bad so

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
the example in xkcd is like

31

bit before we introduce ah wesley wesley

51

yep that's the live next talk on

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,680
gdpr and strategies for failure

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,799
i'm gonna assume there's like

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,399
counterparts that are at least heavily

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,119
implied of strategies for not failure

63
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,120
there as well but that seems pretty

64
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,160
likely

65
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,440
uh and there we are juan thank you for

66
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
for joining thank you for presentation

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,879
ah all right so

68
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,800
uh one i'll give you your bio real quick

69
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
before we get you started

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
after working as a sys admin in

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,200
hospitality ah sysadmin background i

72
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,120
i am completely biased but i think it's

73
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,720
such a great background for so many

74
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
fields within it

75
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,000
at a time where data protection laws

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
were crappy but growing around the world

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
i i added the crappy part

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,160
one has been trying to help other it

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,000
folks avoid the headaches involved in

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
analyzing basic compliance requirements

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
a lot of people hear the word compliance

82
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
and just run away or think

83
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,360
i'm not really responsible for that so

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
i'm never going to learn anything about

85
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,959
it and just ignore it entirely

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
um that's at least my bias take uh two

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
years after gdpr went live we've seen

88
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,000
some unforeseen consequences as to how

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
europeans communicate with the other

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
side of the pond

91
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
where the other side of the pond hi

92
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
american here

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
uh are you on the other other side of

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,599
the pond are you on the

95
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,239
european side yourself one i am on the

96
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,959
other side of the pond

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,319
where are you based out of curiosity i

98
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,840
don't think it said it here uh

99
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
switzerland

100
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,000
switzerland nice that's awesome um okay

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
so two years after gpr went live

102
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,760
unforeseen consequence was how europeans

103
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
communicate with the other side of the

104
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,680
bond hey

105
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,920
other stuff uh while cves and remote

106
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,680
shells are all the hype in the infosec

107
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,319
community

108
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,400
the fines involved with bad data

109
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,599
protection strategies

110
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,760
hey uh what's that headline what's the

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,840
maximum fine for gdpr

112
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
violations so it's uh four percent of

113
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
annual turnover

114
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,080
which uh of course this is not just uh a

115
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
one-time fine this is for every

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,439
uh breach encountered so you're saying

117
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,480
what

118
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,400
i usually hear at phrases four percent

119
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,159
up of global

120
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,360
revenue not profit oh my goodness that's

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,480
a headline like there's

122
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,920
teeth to this compliance it has a chance

123
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,000
it gets you to sit up and pay attention

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
because it can have some serious

125
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,799
consequences

126
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,640
which is beyond what many compliance

127
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
frameworks have in place

128
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
uh the fines involved bad data

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,839
protection strategies are the tools that

130
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,000
can a company beyond repair

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,280
that gets the executives to set up and

132
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,440
pay attention as it should

133
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
according to mackenzie juan can provide

134
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,840
the first gdpr talk i made it to the end

135
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,639
without dying 13 times

136
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,400
that is one hell of an endorsement was

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,840
or rather some strategies for failure

172
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,560
now gdpr came around in 2018

173
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,319
it's a set of laws that define how

174
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,840
companies need to protect consumer data

175
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,960
as well as defining what they are

176
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,280
allowed to do or what they're not

177
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,319
allowed to do and with which

178
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
restrictions

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
it has had some unprocessing

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,960
consequences everyone remembers all the

181
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
this website uses cookies banner that

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,400
popped up

183
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
not sure to what extent that happened in

184
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,080
the u.s

185
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,360
in europe we're also seeing lots of

186
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
websites suddenly saying

187
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
this content is banned or not available

188
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
to you because

189
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
gdpr

190
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,160
so as i mentioned gdpr is a

191
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
text of law and the main issue of this

192
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,479
is that of course the people

193
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
implementing the controls for how the

194
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,880
data moves

195
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
are technical people but because it's a

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,120
text of law it's

197
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,919
open to interpretation at some points

198
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,319
most

199
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,039
specifically gdpr constantly mentions

200
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:57,919
the use of

201
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,319
state-of-the-art infrastructure when

202
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,199
talking about uh

203
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,080
security so aside people would take that

204
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,960
as saying okay

205
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
you just need to buy more blinky boxes

206
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
and then you're fine

207
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,919
of course we'll know that doesn't

208
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,400
provide any additional security

209
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
and these are some elements which make

210
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
it difficult to see eye to eye

211
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
between the people applying the law and

212
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
the people

213
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,160
trying to keep the companies afloat

214
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,880
gdpr as i mentioned protects citizens of

215
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,039
the european union

216
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,840
visitors to the european union and

217
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,360
companies who wish to target these

218
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,479
demographics

219
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,160
as key markets

220
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
need to be compliant with this that

221
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
means your local

222
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,240
corner store does not have to be gdpr

223
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
compliance

224
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,199
if on the other hand you are a big chain

225
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
of hotels trying to get european

226
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,720
tourists

227
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
you do need to make sure about this

228
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
compliance

229
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,440
i do come from the services industry

230
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
which means i'm not focusing here

231
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
on data portability uh

232
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
you wouldn't go to a restaurant to

233
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
request your data

234
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,879
so you can go down to the rest

235
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
restaurant closer to yours

236
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,080
and have them take it

237
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
from the services industry perspective i

238
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,520
think these are the rights which are

239
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,440
most critical to ensure that you're

240
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
respecting

241
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,720
the right to be forgotten this means

242
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,280
that

243
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,599
your clients can come and say i don't

244
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,720
want my name to be

245
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,279
associated here anymore the data needs

246
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
to be either

247
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,760
deleted or anonymized there is the

248
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,679
caveat that all financial transactions

249
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
are immutable because

250
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,800
money laundering tax evasion

251
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
but these records can't be processed or

252
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,720
accessed aside from

253
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
those purposes

254
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,560
the right of correction if for any

255
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
reason you need to change

256
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,680
your name email address phone number how

257
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,279
companies can contact you

258
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,080
or of course any data on the public

259
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,880
internet

260
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,519
which misrepresents you you can enforce

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,320
these changes

262
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,920
under gdpr you can't go to a restaurant

263
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
two weeks down the line and say hey i

264
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,920
paid here fifteen dollars i only wanted

265
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
to pay ten

266
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,080
that's not quite the same

267
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,560
you have the right of ownership to data

268
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,120
point all

269
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,959
any data point that links back to you

270
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,519
if you go to the bar assuming bars are

271
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,800
still open

272
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,760
and you pay for your drinks in cash the

273
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,839
transaction is anonymous

274
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,440
it's not owned by you or anyone

275
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,279
else aside from the company managing the

276
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,000
bar

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
if on the other hand you go to a hotel

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,440
you have a reservation

279
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,800
which links back to you by name email

280
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,440
phone number in the evening you go to

281
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,240
the restaurant

282
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,200
have a meal have a charge to your room

283
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
you're creating a transaction which

284
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,880
links back to your reservation

285
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,040
you then go to the bar grab a couple

286
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
beers

287
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,680
once more charge that to your room again

288
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,040
transaction link back to your

289
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,200
reservation links back to you

290
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
through name phone email

291
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
because these data points or these

292
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,160
transactions link back to you

293
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,320
they are technically your ownership or

294
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,040
you can control how these are used

295
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,839
had you paid directly with a credit card

296
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,519
or in cash

297
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
the transaction would not link back

298
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
directly to you or it would be more

299
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,560
difficult for the

300
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,600
property to link these to you and so you

301
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,959
have less control over this

302
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,160
finally because these data points are

303
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,959
yours

304
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,079
you have the right to restrict the

305
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,399
access to and the processing of this

306
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,959
information

307
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
this is specific for all information

308
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,320
that you're providing the property

309
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
or the business is to be used within

310
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,399
your business transactions you go to a

311
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,279
hotel

312
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,760
you give your name a passport because

313
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,880
they need to provide this to

314
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
authorities and they're providing you

315
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,160
with the room

316
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,519
that doesn't mean that they're then free

317
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,279
to contact you every week telling you of

318
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,480
the new menu

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
this also means that they can't just

320
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
take all your details

321
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,120
and send them off to different company

322
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
for saying hey uh taxi companies to

323
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,680
suddenly start emailing you about offers

324
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,279
for rights to the airport on the next

325
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,519
day

326
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
if you're able to cover these

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,680
five rights as a start for your

328
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,279
compliance

329
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,320
it's a good start for your strategy

330
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
now if you're trying to build up

331
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
your own strategy think about where the

332
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,680
data is going

333
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,160
if it were yours would you be happy with

334
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,439
it being disseminated in that way

335
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
now what are the risks in the case of

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,639
non-compliance

337
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,240
the first one is downtime

338
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,000
if you have a breach you obviously have

339
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,639
the

340
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,480
incident response and if from there it's

341
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,519
found that

342
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,200
you are violating the regulations

343
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,240
it's going to lead to a further

344
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,760
investigation extended downtime

345
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,880
loss of revenue

346
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
there is a potential harm to reputation

347
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
although

348
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
arguably in recent times or high profile

349
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,680
cases

350
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
the loss of mark

351
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,440
the loss of business from these breaches

352
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,240
has been

353
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
relatively minimal or short-lived

354
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
and of course as mentioned before

355
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,160
defines

356
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
up to four percent up to four percent of

357
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,600
annual revenue

358
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
per infraction this means if you're

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,040
disseminating

360
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,360
data to three parties that's twelve

361
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,079
percent

362
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,600
not just four something good when trying

363
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,720
to talk with

364
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,120
higher level management

365
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,920
obviously security and compliance are

366
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,519
not the same

367
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,800
one does not apply to the other but

368
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
a good security strategy will be

369
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
limiting how your data is leaving

370
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,040
providing some compliance and limiting

371
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,160
access to your data from third parties

372
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,040
likewise a good compliance strategy will

373
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
be limiting

374
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,839
how long you're keeping data for

375
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,040
limiting your exposure

376
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,279
providing you on the same hand with some

377
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,560
better security posture

378
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,440
so who am i i'm juan

379
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,079
i worked for close to three years in it4

380
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,320
hospitality

381
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,600
during that time we had the gdpr go live

382
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,800
and i was involved with implementing the

383
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,399
corporate strategy

384
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,199
developing our own procedures across all

385
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,800
departments

386
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
doing the risk analysis for all

387
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
departments

388
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,440
where we found the key for us was hr for

389
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,240
all things with

390
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,360
employee data and marketing

391
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,720
for all things client facing if you're

392
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,000
coming from a different industry

393
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,079
different business case it's highly

394
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,920
likely that operations are going to take

395
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,320
a

396
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,760
much higher priority

397
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,519
in you so

398
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,040
with no further ado i'm going to start

399
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,519
with the strategies for failure

400
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,279
with a little tale hansel and gretel and

401
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,560
the forest of compliance

402
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,480
once upon a time there was gretel gretel

403
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,360
was the ceo

404
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,399
of megacorp she built this company from

405
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:48,800
the

406
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,440
ground up putting in her blood sweat and

407
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
tears into it

408
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,079
and megacorp is a big seller of goods

409
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,199
and services across the world

410
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,680
as part of her weekly routine redfield

411
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,480
would

412
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,519
cross the plains to get to europe she

413
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,800
would get the orders

414
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,920
come back to megacorp and make sure that

415
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,279
the delivery process was went smoothly

416
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,199
this happened for many years until one

417
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,519
day in 2018

418
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,360
as she was heading off to collect the

419
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,279
orders from europe

420
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,040
she was faced with this forest

421
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,959
the forest seemed dangerous and all she

422
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,560
all she could see around it was a little

423
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,119
sign that said

424
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,680
if you can protect the data you can

425
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,480
cross the forest safely

426
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,120
rachel thought nothing of it i can just

427
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,800
uh walk right in and it's gonna be fine

428
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,839
great i looked around found a little

429
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,079
path

430
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,160
walked through the forest for a couple

431
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
hours

432
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,959
but slowly the path got

433
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,759
smaller and smaller until suddenly it

434
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,480
was just

435
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,079
the space between two trees and not a

436
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,160
path anymore

437
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
she tried to turn back to head back to

438
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,399
megacorp but

439
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,880
she'd hit a dead end and couldn't leave

440
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,360
the forest

441
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,639
obviously as with any regulation any

442
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,440
standard

443
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,839
if you're trying to be above board

444
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,759
you can't go at it with no strategy

445
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,160
you need to think about what you have to

446
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,839
do or what's required of you

447
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,519
and then you have the ability to go on

448
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,360
because of course i'm a benevolent

449
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,880
narrator

450
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,040
we get to bring gretel back to the start

451
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,759
of the forest

452
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
gretel remembers that she can't just go

453
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,759
into the forest

454
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,600
and come out the other side unscathed

455
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,800
the pain or trauma from this experience

456
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,079
makes her rethink

457
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,920
her choices rattle decides to head back

458
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,719
to megacorp

459
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
and comes back the next day the forest

460
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,959
is still there

461
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,720
gretel decides one more day of waiting

462
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,520
one more week she no longer has any

463
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,480
orders from

464
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
europe which means she's also no longer

465
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,480
delivering there

466
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,839
she starts getting phone calls from

467
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,160
suppliers telling her that due to the

468
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,039
loss of

469
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,720
business they're having to lay people

470
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
off

471
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,520
gretel feels a little bit responsible

472
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,480
for this but

473
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,080
she's not ready to face the forest again

474
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,520
alone slowly

475
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
as the businesses uh have to lay more

476
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,039
and more people out

477
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,000
of work what used to be a prosperous

478
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,919
land becomes a

479
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,840
barren wasteland

480
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,960
of course it's very difficult to or

481
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,400
rather it's very easy to define

482
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,520
decide to not work with europe

483
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,200
however that's a strategy that's rather

484
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
difficult to explain to

485
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,559
higher level management especially if

486
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,280
you're

487
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
not working in news anything to do with

488
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,679
goods and services

489
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
of course they're going to be wanting to

490
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
target one of the largest markets

491
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,880
in the world

492
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,600
so once more because we are benevolent

493
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,799
we let gretel

494
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,760
try once again

495
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,600
gretel knows she can cross into the

496
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,039
forest

497
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,280
but she also knows she can't go just

498
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,679
anywhere

499
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,960
she decides she's going to try to get

500
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,760
some help inside the forest

501
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,320
after all forests are living things

502
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,200
she walks slowly carefully trying to

503
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,039
look out for sounds

504
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,720
and here's a little laughter from

505
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,559
underneath from underneath a mushroom

506
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,480
she looks closer and meets sophie

507
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,039
sophie comes from the forest and it

508
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,919
tells gretel

509
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,679
hey i can protect you all you need to do

510
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,559
is give me

511
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,799
your contracts i'll take a look over

512
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,760
them

513
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,039
and give you a paper to help get you out

514
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,000
greta thinks this is great because she's

515
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,320
a

516
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,080
respected businesswoman she always has a

517
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,320
copy of her contracts on her

518
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,440
so she gives these to sophie

519
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,559
sophie takes a look through the

520
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,559
contracts make some remarks

521
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,080
gives them back to gretel along with a

522
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,440
paper showing gretel the way out

523
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,559
gretel takes this and is on her way

524
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,160
once again she's able to get a little

525
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,679
bit further into the forest

526
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,840
but once more she starts noticing that

527
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
the trees around her

528
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,799
seem to be closing in and she's not able

529
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,600
to

530
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,280
see the edge of the forest anymore

531
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,760
until at one point she finds that she's

532
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,160
completely locked in by the trees

533
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,000
unsure what happened because of course

534
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,840
she was being protected by sophie

535
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,400
except sophie didn't really care about

536
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
gretel's business

537
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,480
she was only protecting her from other

538
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,919
parties but not from herself

539
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
if you get a lawyer involved in as part

540
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,360
of your strategy

541
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,240
it's very important to make sure that

542
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,960
they're

543
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,000
not only looking at how your

544
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
vendors and partners manage your data

545
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,039
this is one element of the

546
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,320
threat vectors or existing risks to

547
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,440
compliance but it is not the

548
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,840
end-all solution for it

549
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,320
we bring greta then back to the start of

550
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,720
her path

551
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,159
she knows she has to cross the forest

552
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,280
because otherwise

553
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,559
all of her countrymen and women

554
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,840
are going to end up in the barren

555
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,000
wasteland

556
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
she can't go at it blindfolded or it's

557
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
going to

558
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
end up in a mess and she can't trust the

559
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,559
help from inside the forest

560
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,840
she needs help before

561
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,200
gretel decides to contact a lawyer

562
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,559
beforehand

563
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,559
someone to check over her operations

564
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,080
after all if sophie was able to

565
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,919
protect her for a bit inside the forest

566
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,799
maybe she can get some protection from

567
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,039
before the forest and with that be able

568
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,080
to cross to the other side

569
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,679
the lawyer comes on site checks for

570
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,200
things

571
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
provides gradual with a checklist with

572
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,799
which gretel quickly

573
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,039
files as well as a paper stating that

574
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,720
the operations were checked

575
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,640
gretel heads up into the forest

576
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,919
confident this time that

577
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,120
she's going to be able to get to the

578
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,678
other side

579
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,440
as you can imagine once more she hits

580
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,000
the dead end

581
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,320
it's very easy to have audits done on

582
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,879
businesses

583
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
operations and relations with other

584
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
parties

585
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,280
if nothing is done about these audits

586
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,200
it's the same as having a penetration

587
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
test every year for pci

588
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,840
storing it and not doing anything about

589
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,559
it

590
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,320
you're not becoming compliant you have

591
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,000
simply created a checklist of things to

592
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,120
do which

593
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,320
you're not doing and the audit is not

594
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,840
part of the compliance it's

595
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,158
actually executing those tasks which is

596
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,919
gretel is now tired of getting lost in

597
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,400
the forest

598
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,679
she remembers that no matter what she

599
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,440
does no one seems to be able to get her

600
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,159
across

601
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,200
to the other side so she calls on her

602
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,080
brother

603
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,600
hansel hansel has been managing it for

604
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,039
her company ever since they went to

605
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,720
digital

606
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
unfortunately hansel is highly

607
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,760
understaffed which

608
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,480
has led to them having a couple issues

609
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,000
of burnout

610
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,799
but hazard has been able to overcome

611
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,039
most

612
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,280
challenges through his extensive network

613
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,320
of i.t professionals

614
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,460
hansel decides he's not going to

615
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,919
[Music]

616
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,280
brute force his way through the forest

617
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,799
instead he's going to contact one of his

618
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,039
friends

619
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,000
jack tells him yeah we worked with um

620
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,480
this woman rapunzel she sold us some

621
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,840
diamonds and um

622
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,200
we're able to get across to the other

623
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,279
end of the forest

624
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,400
so hazel sets up the meeting

625
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,520
rapunzel shows him the diamond and tells

626
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,480
him

627
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,000
this diamond will protect you to the

628
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
other end of the forest

629
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,159
look at all this list of high name

630
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,840
clients that we have

631
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
they've all purchased our diamonds and

632
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,880
they're getting to the other side of the

633
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,279
forest

634
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,000
also thinks this is great this is the

635
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,440
ultimate weapon tool

636
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,039
or the ultimate tool to get to the other

637
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,679
side so

638
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,640
castle heads off into the forest alone

639
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,240
and as his as he's nearing the edge of

640
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,919
the forest

641
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,840
he hears a noise just to his left

642
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,559
he thinks okay i can leave the forest

643
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,760
and be in europe where i can

644
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,279
just quickly look at what that noise is

645
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,080
so he gets closer to the forest i add to

646
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,720
the source of the noise

647
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,559
and he sees a very tall tower

648
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,440
okay so this is the source of the noise

649
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,200
but what he sees in the tower

650
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,840
impacts him even more where there's a

651
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,559
door frame

652
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,120
which should hold the door but it's just

653
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
the door frame

654
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
he thinks this is very odd and he sees

655
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
lots of gremlins

656
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,520
going in and out holding papers he

657
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,360
wonders what's going on here

658
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,799
so he gets closer to the tower

659
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,159
and asks one of the gremlins what's

660
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,000
going on

661
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,559
the gremlin hands him one of the pieces

662
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,480
of paper

663
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,679
and hansel sees his company's details

664
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,000
all over it

665
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,360
the edge of the forest which seems so

666
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,840
close now it seems so far away

667
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
he finds himself unable to leave from

668
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,678
this tower

669
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,880
because of course he's been putting all

670
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,799
of his data off premise

671
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,640
with someone who is selling him a shiny

672
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,039
diamond

673
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,080
if any company tries to sell you

674
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
at the end-all be-all tool of

675
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,200
for compliance 99 of the time

676
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,760
what they're selling you as a customer

677
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,600
relationship manager

678
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,720
they're going to be rebuilding your

679
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,600
databases off sites where you have no

680
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,360
more control over them

681
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,039
and because of the way responsibilities

682
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,440
are managed with regards of

683
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,200
who is supposed to own the data and

684
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
who's processing it

685
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,679
if they get breached they can claim that

686
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,559
it's your fault for

687
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,520
handing them the data and likewise if

688
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,120
you get breached

689
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,480
and it's found that you were giving them

690
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,440
this data you're of course

691
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,480
not much better off

692
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,200
hansel not wanting to be

693
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,640
beaten in such a way takes his memory

694
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,600
and decides to

695
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,240
call upon his heads of department

696
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,080
he has the donkey who is in charge of

697
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,679
well all the automated tasks

698
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,240
the cat who provides support but is

699
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,960
really mean with clients

700
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,400
the dog who the clients love

701
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,480
and the rooster that just makes sure

702
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,840
everything runs smoothly

703
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,760
he talks to the four animals and says

704
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,520
hey we need to cross the

705
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,000
the forest but we need to protect our

706
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,679
customers data

707
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,399
and no matter what we do we seem to

708
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,678
having to start all over again

709
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
they talk it through and realize that

710
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,200
all of them are affected by it

711
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,679
differently

712
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,200
the donkey who's primarily accessing

713
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
data for

714
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,120
automated tasks so he only needs to be

715
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,720
aware of the risks when he's accessing

716
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,279
this data

717
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,120
the cat who's working with the erp

718
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,000
the crm and various monitoring tools

719
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,760
needs to inform his

720
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,200
subordinates about the risks involved in

721
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,559
the data how not to move it or keeping

722
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:56,960
it

723
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,559
in company infrastructure and of course

724
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,320
training them in the behavior with using

725
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
the crp crm to ensure

726
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,480
compliance the dog who takes

727
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,159
orders from clients working the data

728
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,559
entry

729
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
all the importance on the behavior and

730
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,720
how he's going to be taking notes for

731
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,240
this

732
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,880
either directly entering it to the erp

733
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,240
or crm

734
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,520
rather than post it around it because of

735
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,880
the risks involved

736
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,840
for his clients

737
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,679
the dog subordinates who are directly

738
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,320
facing the

739
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,880
clients those at the front of the house

740
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,799
as we say

741
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,080
they need to be aware of the company

742
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,960
policies with the data protection

743
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,520
how does this link to their behavior and

744
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,240
the security

745
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,840
not only security for the data

746
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,559
but also the risks to the company if

747
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,279
they don't

748
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,000
comply to these policies as well as the

749
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
risks to themselves depending on how

750
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,919
they're

751
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,120
communicating with the other clients

752
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,279
finally the rooster this high management

753
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,960
person animal

754
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
understands that as a high value target

755
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,399
his behavior is

756
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,640
critical to ensure compliance across the

757
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,080
board

758
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,840
not only is he more at risk than the

759
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,399
others

760
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,880
to be targeted but policies affect them

761
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,760
even more

762
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,320
not less

763
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,240
armed with this strategy the team heads

764
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,640
up into the forest

765
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,399
whether or not they make it to the other

766
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,919
side is left

767
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,440
to the viewers for decision

768
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,799

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,880
carrel who was my

774
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
mentor for the con zoe rose who went

775
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,880
through the slides and some humphreys

776
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,039
who also helped me a lot with the gdpr

777
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,440
elements

778
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,120
now i appreciate it one this is very

779
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
interesting because i know this is

780
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,520
something that we deal with

781
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,799
on daily basis gdpr everything

782
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,640
i also found this is it's a very good

783
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,840
way to really

784
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
get everybody in the organization's

785
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,600
attention you know if you can link any

786
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,080
of your

787
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,440
findings or um exploits back to

788
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,720
gdpr um any type of regulations people's

789
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,399
eyes perk up and you know it's like hey

790
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,840
well what do you say

791
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,679
you know they they understand those

792
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,240
costs so no absolutely very good

793
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,799
information

794
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,159
i i do uh a complete side note for the

795
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,200
actual content

796
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,600
i am always uh impressed with

797
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,840
intentionally choosing slides with

798
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,720
you know a handful of words at most or

799
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,519
zero

800
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,840
and going through the story time

801
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,760
nonetheless so

802
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,360
regardless of the actual content which

803
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,440
itself was awesome let me uh

804
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,399
highlight the the top tier speaking

805
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,360
capability that you demonstrated there

806
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,559
so very nicely done uh so comment from

807
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,200
the

808
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
discord coming in great talk help break

809
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,960
this complex topic into consumable

810
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,679
pieces

811
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,440
this is continue with that theme make

812
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,360
the complex simple make the complex

813
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,559
understandable

814
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,799
even if it's a complicated thing i know

815
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,880
you had a very early slide of you have

816
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,480
the right to be forgotten you have the

817
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,039
right to

818
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,080
privacy like there are gdpr i don't know

819
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,240
how long the text of it itself is but i

820
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,000
think it's safe to say at least hundreds

821
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,159
of pages if not thousands to be full

822
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,279
actual text but the the

823
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,120
one sentence description of the right to

824
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,480
be forgotten like

825
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,159
what that describes so much so quickly

826
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:58,559
so

827
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,240
you start off with big picture work into

828
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,840
more complex as necessary

829
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,039
you made things relatable via stories so

830
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,320
and you ended with a haiku so i mean how

831
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,840
much more awesome could it be so i'm

832
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,840
you're done good thank you thank you

833
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,880

coming up we're doing fine for time we

840
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,519
have a couple more minutes if you need

841
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,159

842
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,840
i don't know why it was great man you

843
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,919
you should pat you like like jeff's

844
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,360
like jeff said you just passed a level

845
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,200
of just talking points and everything

846
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,000
and honestly

847
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,200
this is something like that's it's

848
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,399
always being interpreted different ways

849
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:50,720
so

850
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,159
i i take my hat up to you to take a

851
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,159
complex type of like gdpr especially

852
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,440
when you have a bunch of lawyers working

853
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,080
around it

854
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,200
and bringing it down to something like

855
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,120
okay you can use it more of like an

856
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,039
awareness thing like hey this is

857
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,760
what it is per se so hats off to you i

858
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,039
love it

859
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,360
i'm a big fan of the phrase mental model

860
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,320
building out your

861
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
your understanding of how something

862
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
works you can get into the of course the

863
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,440
nitty and gritty later on but

864
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,039
building out your mental model of like

865
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,039
this is what gdpr is

866
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,519
in a couple sentences or a couple

867
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,799
paragraphs and be able to

868
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,360
understand that and relay it to others

869
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,519
that helps things spread i like to build

870
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,440
up my mental model of a lot of areas

871
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,799
even though there's a lot of things that

872
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,279
i don't examine further in further depth

873
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,159
that's okay

874
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,480
if i understand what kind of the basics

875
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,559
are of that area that's being like

876
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,960
it generalist right sysadmin work

877
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,480
started off with a lot of general lists

878
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
and you dive deep into areas as

879
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
need be but you'll understand the the

880
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,760
overall scenario that's why

881
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,360
i'm completely biased i think

882
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,279
sysadminwork is a great segue to a lot

883
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,880
of fields within it

884
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,799
uh help desk very similar situation

885
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,200
network admin very similar situation

886
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
you just you get a big breadth of

887
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,559
experience before diving into something

888
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,200
that

889
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,360
really interests you for the one niche

890
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,039
or you stay a generalist which is fine

891
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,200
as well

892
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,918
okay with that being said again thank

893
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,239
you
