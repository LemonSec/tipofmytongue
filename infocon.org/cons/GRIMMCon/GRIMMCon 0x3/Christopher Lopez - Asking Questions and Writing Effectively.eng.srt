i totally planned that uh is on

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,279

mcjugger

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
uh christopher lopez is a father first

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
and a sock analyst

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
second if i were to say sorry if

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,120
christopher were to say he had a

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,760
superpower

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,480
it would be the ability to ask questions

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
thank you alright be

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,399
able and willing to ask questions even

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,840
if they seem like silly

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,760
or stupid questions is in fact a

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,160
superpower i wish more people had and

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
used that superpower

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,400
uh this is what uh chris go by

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,600
christopher or chris i'm assuming

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,040
christopher whatever is easier

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
honestly but christopher feels our his

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,439
work his analysts mainly consist of

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,119
asking the best questions to drive our

37
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,400
analysis yes

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,240
questions are far more interesting than

39
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,560
answers i think i've been in infosec

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,720
field for a few years but a sock analyst

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,040
throughout uh chris came from i.t been

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,240
very fortunate to have great people

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,320
around to learn from oh my goodness

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,720
this theme of learning from other people

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,240
and sharing that learning

46
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
i am happy that uh this track is

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,079
emphasizing that through

48
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,079
and our speakers are as well chris

49
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,600
enjoys understanding how an analyst

50
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
investigates and jumps down rabbit holes

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,600
to learn how things work yes

52
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,439
sometimes rabbit holes are worth further

53
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,640
investigation because there

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
are answers out there this is why we

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,079
have lab environments

56
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,479
this is why we have forensic artifacts

57
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,920
and kind of the

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,840
ability to make good questions and

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,079
answer them uh that sometimes takes your

60
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,399
own

61
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
somewhat original research and that's

62
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
fine this is how we advance as a

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,759
community in advance as a field

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,960
so uh with that said uh unless uh wesley

65
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,719
do you have any uh last comments before

66
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,280
we

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
break away and give it to christopher no

68
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,800
i'm ready for it i'm ready for this

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,599
presentation

70
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,760
i'm excited about this one i'm excited

71
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,640
for this one so

72
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
uh christopher will drop off and let you

73
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,319
take it away just so you know

74
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,000
we have 30 minutes allocated for your

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,599
talk it does not mean you have to end at

76
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
45 after on the dot we have a little bit

77
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,800
of wiggle room for q

78
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,720
a and banter and i stole two minutes

79
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
from you

80
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
so christopher take it away and thank

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
you very much

82
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,440
all right perfect so we're going to

83
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,239
cover

84
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,000
asking questions and writing effectively

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
today as was already mentioned

86
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
this is one of my favorite topics um you

87
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,480
know i was very fortunate like i said in

88
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
my bio

89
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,519
to have people around to guide me

90
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,959
because i didn't understand anything

91
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,519
about

92
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,280
cyber security or info cycle and

93
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,879
whatever we want to call it

94
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,280
when i first started right so definitely

95
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,920
something i'm passionate to talk about

96
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,599
okay so this was also mentioned a little

97
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,440
bit uh i'm a father

98
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,760
that's kind of my most important role in

99
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,480
life

100
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
and i've been a stock analyst an

101
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,159
investigator for

102
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,840
you know all of my career with an

103
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
infosec and

104
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,800
all i do is ask questions uh if anyone

105
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,640
would know ask someone that knows me

106
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,239
personally they would say

107
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
that yeah uh chris talks a lot and he's

108
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,319
always asking questions about stuff

109
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,680
it just helps me understand things

110
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
better so

111
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
the agenda what are we going to talk

112
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
about uh we're going to talk about

113
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,159
questions there's going to be a lot of

114
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,519
that here we're going to talk about how

115
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
to ask questions why they matter

116
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,959
and how that works into the

117
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,720
investigative engine

118
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
and then we're going to pivot over to

119
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
write ups because this is how

120
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
you know value is derived from your

121
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,319
analysis as

122
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,480
an analyst right so it's really

123
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,000
important to be able to translate the

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,440
answers to your questions

125
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
in the most effective right as possible

126
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,599
for your leadership to make decisions

127
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,640
and of course this is all based on you

128
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,799
know the sock analyst perspective since

129
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,680
that's what i am

130
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
so just keep that in mind as we roll

131
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
through this

132
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
okay so here's the best part the tools

133
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,519
to be an awesome investigator

134
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,599
you don't need that much uh you need

135
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,040
your mind right

136
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
your questions that's in bold for a

137
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840
reason we're gonna keep going through

138
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,560
that

139
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
um your biases uh very interesting just

140
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
the way that you think about things is

141
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,839
really important to keep that in mind

142
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,959
and be aware of them

143
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
your perspective and your experiences it

144
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
doesn't have to be an infosec related

145
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,160
experience it can be

146
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
you know you learn how to ride a bike i

147
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,199
don't know you can bring that in to be

148
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,880
an awesome investigator

149
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,960
so another thing is somewhere to take

150
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
notes right i still use

151
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
uh paper and pencil i don't know it just

152
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,080
feels good

153
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,759
instead of typing all day like i usually

154
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,000
do but of course any text editor uh

155
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,639
you know would help you uh a loosely

156
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,800
defined process the reason i emphasize

157
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,199
lucy defined is because i feel that

158
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,320
investigations

159
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,720
really benefit from the creative minds

160
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,759
of analysts

161
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,479
and having a very structured process to

162
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,880
investigate can stifle that creativity

163
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,280
that can come out of an investigation so

164
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
just have like

165
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,440
you know a guideline that you follow as

166
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,479
you're investigating

167
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,840
and of course your team members uh lean

168
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,479
on them

169
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,400
that's super important there's always

170
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,919
something to learn from everyone that

171
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,479
you meet

172
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400
especially people that are investigating

173
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,240
things are in the same team as you

174
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
so just lean on them and that will help

175
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
you become a better investigator as well

176
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,280
this is the engine that we're gonna

177
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,759
focus on right this is the investigation

178
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,440
engine at least from my perspective this

179
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,080
is how

180
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
investigations usually work you have

181
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
your questions

182
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
and with your questions that you ask

183
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,960
yourself based on an input

184
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,600
right an alert for example uh you

185
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,120
collect artifacts to answer those

186
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,800
questions right that can be logs

187
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,280
that can be no is usually is logs that's

188
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,919
what we

189
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,880
primarily deal with uh rabbit holes come

190
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,440
in

191
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,639
the reason i put them here is because

192
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,080
they can be one of the most enjoyable

193
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
experiences that you have during

194
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,880
investigation

195
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,960
but they can also really take away a lot

196
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,560
of your time i spent a lot of time in

197
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
raga holes trying to understand things

198
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
but they're part of the engine of

199
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,160
investigating compiling your findings

200
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,039
right so after you've analyzed your logs

201
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
and you've you know reached out to users

202
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,400
if you need to and you've

203
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,639
spoken to your team members you compile

204
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,000
your findings and then you form a

205
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,880
conclusion

206
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,240
right you try to answer the question

207
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,919
that we are all trying to answer is this

208
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,440
bad you know is this a

209
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
true positive is this a false positive

210
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,960
and then you document right

211
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
documentation

212
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
is super important it's how everyone

213
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
learns from each other and it's how you

214
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,400
track

215
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,199
you know what you're doing and uh if if

216
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,400
there was anything that i would say to

217
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,680
take away from this is that

218
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,400
documentation is key to making sure that

219
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,000
everyone keeps getting better as an

220
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
analyst

221
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,479
so what does that look like uh the

222
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,840
beauty here is that

223
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,759
this is not recreating the wheel this is

224
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,360
not something new

225
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
we've been taught this since elementary

226
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,919
school we are applying the scientific

227
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,440
method to understand how an

228
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
investigation works

229
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,280
in order to answer the question that we

230
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,319
need to answer right

231
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,840
which is is this a bad thing that

232
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
happened for example and your leadership

233
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,759
may need to understand that to make

234
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,280
decisions that

235
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,039
would protect your company or whoever it

236
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,639
is you're working for

237
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
so of course there's an observation

238
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,080
that's your input

239
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
that is your alert for example or a

240
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,960
email that's sent to your shared mailbox

241
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,080
from users that

242
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,759
want to contact you about strange

243
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,759
activity and you have your questions

244
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,759
right your then you form a hypothesis

245
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,199
what you think is going to happen

246
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,960
you experiment in this case you pull

247
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,400
logs right or

248
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
you figure out some way of getting more

249
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,319
evidence uh you analyze that evidence

250
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,440
and you form a conclusion

251
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
it's all the same thing uh and it makes

252
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,120
me really comfortable to know that

253
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
you know it aligns with what we've been

254
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,639
taught since elementary school makes it

255
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,759
easier to keep it in mind

256
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,280
these are our questions this is what

257
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,800
we're going to focus on this is the the

258
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
meat and potatoes of the conversation

259
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,280
here

260
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,160
uh the what the why when where who and

261
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,199
how

262
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,680
so let's just jump into these questions

263
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,639
the what

264
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,039
i consider this to be the input this is

265
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,199
i've said it a few times this is a

266
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,759
sim detection right this is an alert or

267
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,440
this can be a threat hunt idea

268
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,599
right uh there's been a lot of you know

269
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,680
breaches recently that we all

270
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
are aware of uh there may be some really

271
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,919
interesting artifacts within some of

272
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,440
these reports that may

273
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
lead to a threat hunt idea to find

274
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,039
evidence of that in your environment

275
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,800
right i mentioned that here

276
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,759
and of course there's always the input

277
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,160
of a new organizational process

278
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,759
many of us are going through this or

279
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,199
have already gone through this

280
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,799
you know with our companies moving to

281
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,399
the cloud you know what does that look

282
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,440
like

283
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,479
should i learn more about this and how

284
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,760
do i use that to create an investigation

285
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,399
around like

286
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
what logs do i even have in the first

287
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
place to have visibility into this

288
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,040
environment

289
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
um this is your input this is where

290
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,399
everything starts from

291
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,240
in the case of this presentation we're

292
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,440
going to focus on

293
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,000
detections and alerts being your input

294
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,519
this is something really important this

295
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
took me a very long time to learn

296
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
so i'd like to have this right after i

297
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,800
talk about

298
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
you know the questions and that is

299
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,080
always question the alert first

300
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,720
this i spend so much time going down

301
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
rabbit holes which are fun

302
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
of course but they can be very time

303
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,399
consuming trying to understand why this

304
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,000
happened like this alert saying that

305
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
this fired or this bad thing happened on

306
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,160
this machine

307
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
and it looks super bad especially since

308
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
you know i was new and i didn't

309
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
understand the context of a lot of

310
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
things i was looking at

311
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,640
and i failed to ask this simple question

312
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,200
of

313
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,760
hey does this alert make sense does this

314
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,399
uh

315
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,800
is it actually finding what it was

316
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,480
intended to find

317
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
is there documentation which there

318
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,560
should be if you're creating detections

319
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
right someone should know who created

320
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
this detection so you can reach out to

321
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,200
them you know

322
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,560
or they're not in the company anymore

323
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,399
but at least you have some context

324
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
around the thought process of a

325
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,160
detection you need to understand

326
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
why this alerted in the first place and

327
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
that can help you throughout the context

328
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,240
of an investigation and it can also stop

329
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,360
an investigation

330
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,279
before it even happens by saying this

331
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,480
doesn't make any sense

332
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,640
this did not find what it was intended

333
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,320
to find this is a false positive

334
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
and this requires some tuning because at

335
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
the end of the day as stock analysts

336
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
we're all trying to improve our

337
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
investigative practice right we're all

338
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,640
trying to

339
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
get better and more effective at

340
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,519
investigating and answering these

341
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,640
questions quickly

342
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
so tuning is part of that process so

343
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
just always remember

344
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
ask that question does this alert even

345
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,640
make sense

346
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,839
the why this is your hypothesis this is

347
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,320
where

348
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
you look at an alert and you're like you

349
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
know what this looks to me

350
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,279
like a false positive now without

351
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,959
evidence there's no way of actually

352
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,160
answering that question

353
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,040
but it's good to have some idea to drive

354
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,560
your investigation this is really

355
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,519
important

356
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,160
and this is something that i tend to

357
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,120
still write down

358
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,040
somewhere i mean if i'm typing in a

359
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
ticketing system for example

360
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
i'll write down what i think you know um

361
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560
just to keep that in mind

362
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
and this leads to the questions that you

363
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
continue to ask yourself to find answers

364
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,760
right an example

365
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,320
of these would be let's say that it's

366
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,480
related to an av detection antivirus

367
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,360
detection

368
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,880
this detective file does not appear

369
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,640
malicious that would be like a

370
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,560
hypothesis right that would be what i

371
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
think about this this is not

372
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
this looks benign this looks like

373
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
someone downloading something that

374
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,040
just looks to be malicious but it's not

375
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,519
or

376
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,120
the phishing email that we received an

377
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
alert about was not clicked

378
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
they received it but it wasn't clicked

379
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,800
and then i go

380
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,959
right and you build your hypothesis

381
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,720
based on these three things that i think

382
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,360
really help you create a really good

383
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,560
hypothesis

384
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,120
um and leslie said it perfectly in the

385
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,880
wild west hacking fest this year and i

386
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
had to put it in here

387
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
uh build your hypothesis based on these

388
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,839
three things is it falsifiable

389
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,240
is it testable and understand the scope

390
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,160
of your hypothesis right is it limited

391
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,360
to one machine

392
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
is it you know throughout your whole

393
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
environment can you even

394
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,519
pull evidence or logs to test this

395
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,720
hypothesis

396
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
right and it's better to prove yourself

397
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
wrong it's it's really interesting if

398
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,079
you go through the process of that

399
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,160
i believe that this malicious

400
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
potentially malicious executable did not

401
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,200
execute

402
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,519
right it did not actually do what it was

403
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,480
intended to do

404
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
on this machine well i'm gonna go look

405
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,519
for logs that

406
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,079
try to prove that it did execute and

407
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:26,880
that helps me

408
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
you know prove to see if something is

409
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
falsifiable this builds out

410
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
the hypothesis which is incredibly

411
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,560
important to drive everything

412
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,120
and this is an example i talked about

413
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
you know the av thing that happens a lot

414
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,000
uh antivirus

415
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,880
you know catches things and um you know

416
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
this is an example alert from june

417
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,040
let's say uh i know we're a little bit

418
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,560
past that but that's okay

419
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,959
uh so it detected a potentially

420
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,720
malicious file in a user directory

421
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
in my hypothesis i did not execute so

422
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,160
now i'm going to go back and i'm going

423
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,920
to try to find anything that i could

424
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,480
to prove that it did the when

425
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,959
okay so here goes the story so i started

426
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,720
in a sock and i didn't understand how to

427
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
do investigations very well

428
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
so i would write down questions that i

429
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,040
should ask myself on a piece of paper

430
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,160
um in order to help me like really

431
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,720
understand you know the daunting process

432
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
i feel a lot of people feel

433
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,399
when they're starting out in infosec

434
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,079
there's always so much going on

435
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,680
and one of the things that i failed to

436
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,519
understand very early on

437
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,160
was when you work for a global company

438
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,600
and there's end points that you're

439
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,279
receiving logs from

440
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,839
different regions of the world is to

441
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,639
understand the importance of time stamps

442
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
um so an example would be i was trying

443
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,000
to investigate a malicious

444
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,839
file there's always there's always that

445
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,040
happening i guess

446
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,160
and um it was on a machine

447
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,519
that was in asia all right that's that's

448
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,560
not the u.s so

449
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,320
it's a completely different time zone

450
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,360
and i was looking for

451
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,720
logs within the sim

452
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,839
that were set to eastern time right i'm

453
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,360
in eastern time and it was set to

454
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
eastern time but there were logs that i

455
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,680
had to pull from the machine itself

456
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
right and access and you know be able to

457
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,760
analyze

458
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,440
that or from the machine but the

459
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
machine's time

460
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,639
is different than the time that i'm

461
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,560
looking at within the sim and that's

462
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,920
something that i didn't

463
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,399
really consider and i ended up looking

464
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,199
hours

465
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,839
away from you know where it was that i

466
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
should be looking for that evidence that

467
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
i was trying to find to answer the

468
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,320
question of

469
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,360
this did this file actually execute

470
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,279
and the problem with that was i was

471
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
wrong so those things happen you make

472
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,680
mistakes right and luckily i had a team

473
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,440
member tell me hey did you

474
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,279
make sure to go back to the right time

475
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,720
on this machine because

476
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
the sim is set to eastern time and this

477
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,079
is not eastern time that you're looking

478
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,040
at these logs

479
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
so they could be off and that was very

480
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,639
helpful because then i found the

481
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,399
evidence that i needed to prove that

482
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,199
this malicious file did execute now if i

483
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,959
didn't have that i would have been wrong

484
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,920
and that would be not the best way of

485
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,120
ending an investigation

486
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,880
but you learned something from this and

487
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,560
that's why it's super important

488
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,360
to ask yourself the when when did this

489
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,240
take place

490
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,560
right and to if you can set everything

491
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,240
to utc because it just makes sense and

492
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,079
it makes your life easier

493
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,199
and last but not least understand time

494
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,560
conversions if you have to

495
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
uh that's something that you know i'll

496
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
go to google and

497
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,279
figure out like what time zone something

498
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,120
is and just do the math and just to make

499
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,160
sure that you're on the right

500
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,720
track on the right page the where now

501
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,440
the where is interesting because this

502
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,959
could be

503
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,199
answered with the one right for example

504
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,000
that asset

505
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
was in asia right but it's also really

506
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,399
interesting to understand the where

507
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,079
through the context of a user

508
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,199
because this allows you to understand

509
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,320
whether or not

510
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
this user is traveling if this is a

511
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,839
laptop if this is a server

512
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,839
that gives you more context as to if

513
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
this is a machine based investigation

514
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,079
right

515
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,680
it gives you more context as to like

516
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,079
what the context of this

517
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,399
investigation contains so is this a

518
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,920
server that would tell me something very

519
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,639
different

520
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,120
than if this was a laptop for example

521
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,680
because

522
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,720
there may be a certain amount of uh you

523
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,000
know standards that you

524
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,320
have towards servers that would help you

525
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
answer questions as to is this

526
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,399
malicious or is this just something that

527
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,920
we've seen in our environment before

528
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,320
that

529
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,720
just looks malicious to this you know

530
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,920
security

531
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,160
appliance that decided to make it you

532
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,360
know an alert

533
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,839
so aware is really interesting

534
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,519
especially with asset management and

535
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,880
it's a good question to ask

536
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,000
yourself who

537
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
all right so we're going to get into a

538
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,040
little bit of attribution here

539
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,560
there's been a lot of talk about threat

540
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,480
intelligence and the power of it and i

541
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
i i think it's incredible um but

542
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,000
understanding

543
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,480
the who around an investigation is

544
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
really important

545
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,000
and i want to really spend a moment here

546
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,040
to talk about

547
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,280
the abstraction of a user account this

548
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
was hard for me to really

549
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,039
you know wrap my head around so just

550
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,760
because

551
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,280
you have a detection that lists a user

552
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,839
account that may have done something

553
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,640
suspicious

554
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,000
it's always really important to

555
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
understand that it doesn't mean that it

556
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
was really that user that did that

557
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,160
you know user accounts can be

558
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,240
compromised so it's really important to

559
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,359
understand the who

560
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,320
behind something and to be aware of the

561
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,160
abstraction level whenever it is you're

562
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,080
dealing with a user

563
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,600
related uh investigation right

564
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,640
so uh an example would be uh you know

565
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,799
knowing when to reach out to a user

566
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,480
about a specific

567
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,280
investigation right trying to really

568
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,840
understand

569
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
who cause you know trying to understand

570
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
if this is an outsider or an insider

571
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,520
type threat that you're dealing with

572
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,760
um and it can even be your co-worker um

573
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,039
what i mean by that is

574
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,440
it can be something where you know one

575
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,480
of your

576
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,960
fellow stock analysts was downloading

577
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,160
something because they wanted to

578
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,360
understand something for their

579
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,480
investigation

580
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
and we're going to keep going on the

581
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
antivirus thing because it happened so

582
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,080
much

583
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,400
antivirus captured a file it doesn't

584
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
mean that your

585
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,400
you know team member their account was

586
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
compromised and something malicious was

587
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,760
executed on their machine

588
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
but what it does mean is that you should

589
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
understand the context of the user

590
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
account itself

591
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,760
um so this is something that's really

592
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
important throughout an investigation

593
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
understanding the who how

594
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,799
this is to me one of the most

595
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,960
enjoyable parts of investigation this is

596
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,360
where i spend most of my time

597
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,679
and it's only because there's this

598
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,559
innate

599
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,280
curiosity that i've had and i think it's

600
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,840
helped me

601
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,640
propel my career um you know within

602
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,440
infosec

603
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,039
is that i just want to understand how

604
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
things work uh and that is

605
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,200
this is such a great field to have that

606
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,640
like innate

607
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,000
question that you're always asking

608
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,679
yourself like why did this happen and

609
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,640
how does this work

610
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,200
right so this is where you start asking

611
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
yourself the question of how did this

612
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,520
get here

613
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,120
and i want to spend a moment talking

614
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,039
about that question because it's so

615
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,000
important

616
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,320
and that is okay so we're going to keep

617
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,760
with the antivirus thing

618
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,280
uh antivirus captures this file

619
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,679
all right it is quarantined and there's

620
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,880
no threat

621
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,160
right so it's really easy to dismiss

622
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,559
that

623
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,000
it's really easy to say okay well

624
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
there's no threat so it's gone

625
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
but the question that should come up is

626
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,480
how did this get here in the first place

627
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,520
why did this get here right like how is

628
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,039
this possible to have

629
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,360
been detected like how many layers of

630
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,799
security

631
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,520
controls do we have in place that should

632
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
have prevented this like a proxy

633
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,559
or whatever that did not

634
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,000
catch this but it's still here and also

635
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,360
how did we detect this was this a user

636
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
that reached out to us and said hey my

637
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,679
machine's acting a little bit weird and

638
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,799
sent us a screenshot

639
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,480
and it looks like something's happening

640
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
on their machine or was this

641
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,600
a detection that we have created as a

642
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,480
team

643
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
based on some behavioral logic that

644
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,679
we've

645
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,760
learned about that's really important

646
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,960
because the goal

647
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,799
of an effective sock as was mentioned

648
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,559
before is to be more effective to keep

649
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,799
building better detections better rules

650
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,640
and to better protect you know the

651
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
organization that you're working for

652
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,200
so how do we detect this is a very

653
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,960
important question to ask because if

654
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,840
this was

655
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,760
a user related you know uh inquiry or

656
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,120
something that they reached out to us

657
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,840
maybe there's

658
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,240
the opportunity of creating a rule

659
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,000
around the behavior of this

660
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,919
event so that's just something to keep

661
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,760
in mind and how does this work

662
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,080
that's where i spend most my time like

663
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,280
how does this file work

664
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
why does it do this thing and what else

665
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,799
can i learn from it right so that's why

666
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,880
we have sandboxes that's why we have vms

667
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,679
that's why

668
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,559
you know we like to detonate malware you

669
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,480
know in a safe environment to see what

670
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,880
it does because you can also

671
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,760
really derive some great detections

672
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,600
around that type of behavior

673
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,000
and that again goes through the cycle of

674
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
improving your suck

675
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,919
the last question with the how is how

676
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,200
impactful is this

677
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,360
right so we haven't talked about the

678
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,720
whole ir

679
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
um you know invoking ir and really going

680
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,600
through the process of escalating

681
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,559
an incident uh you know to up the ranks

682
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,159
depending on you know what level it is

683
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:26,799
that you're on

684
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,520
you know in your in your team but it's

685
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,360
really important to ask this question

686
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,240
even throughout

687
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,000
even throughout your hypothesis creation

688
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,919
is how impactful is this is this enough

689
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,480
to

690
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,280
you know invoke ir is this enough to uh

691
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,000
reach out

692
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,240
let my manager know right like whatever

693
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,520
process you have in place with your

694
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,559
policy

695
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,360
uh you know for an investigation or for

696
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,280
these types of events

697
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,960
it's really important to ask yourself

698
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,360
often like how impactful is this

699
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,960
event okay

700
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,360
so now you spend all this time

701
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,320
answering these questions and writing

702
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,720
this

703
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,320
up in a really rough draft form right or

704
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,880
some ticketing system and now you're

705
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,320
you're ready for the write-up

706
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,559
and uh i just want to stress this a few

707
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,840
times you're going to hear it

708
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,480
probably more than once here and analyst

709
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:18,960
efforts

710
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,919
is reflected to their documentation and

711
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,120
that's super important

712
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,039
because i've been a victim of this

713
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,159
myself in a way

714
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,000
where yeah i just spend the entire day

715
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,679
investigating this but i

716
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,600
don't know how to communicate this

717
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,480
in the way that the audience is

718
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,159
receptive to it

719
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,240
so yeah i can write something super

720
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,000
technical and say hey this is really

721
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
cool the way that this worked

722
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,760
and wow like it did this thing and you

723
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,200
know us analysts are

724
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,280
interesting where we get really excited

725
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,640
when something bad's happening

726
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,559
which is just part of the job because

727
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,080
it's interesting i guess

728
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,520
um it's hard to really communicate

729
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,880
that sometimes in a write-up so this is

730
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,080
just some

731
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,400
uh some things that i've learned from

732
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,679
really

733
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,600
bad write-ups that i've done you know in

734
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
my career so far

735
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,159
so some things to keep in mind uh talk

736
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,679
about what actions you took

737
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,360
right the reason this is so important is

738
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,520
because oh i would love to read

739
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,799
someone's write-up and be able to

740
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,080
replicate their actions

741
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,159
right what did you pull where did where

742
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,840
did you pull this log

743
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,720
source from like what did you search in

744
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,280
the sim

745
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,080
to find this evidence to prove this

746
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,120
thing that you're

747
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
saying uh i think that's really

748
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,159
important for not only

749
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,679
you know the management to understand

750
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,919
your thought process but also to train

751
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,720
others

752
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
um and to help others understand your

753
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
investigation

754
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,679
and when did you take these actions so

755
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,000
this is a secondary timestamp right so

756
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
not only the timestamps of the events

757
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,679
that may have taken place on the machine

758
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,360
but also when did you pull this log like

759
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,320
create a timeline of the events that you

760
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,880
you know

761
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,799
went through throughout the course of

762
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,480
your investigation right i

763
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,799
reached out to this user at this time

764
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,000
via email

765
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
and you have like you know basically you

766
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,440
have the evidence of that

767
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,400
in your inbox or your sent box whatever

768
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,960
um

769
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,039
you know what answers did you obtain

770
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,640
right so

771
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,240
what questions did you ask yourself you

772
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,679
don't have to put the questions

773
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,240
in in the write-up but what did you

774
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,360
learn from this

775
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,919
and of course is escalation required

776
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,039
right did you

777
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,640
find this to be something where you've

778
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
already escalated it and it's just

779
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,919
really important to keep that

780
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,760
somewhere in the right of probably

781
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,360
mostly on top that

782
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,520
you did reach out to someone and this

783
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,039
was already escalated and this is the

784
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,880
bottom line right

785
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,679
so what is your conclusion this is

786
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,480
really important

787
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,559
right this is all providing facts this

788
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,400
is all not

789
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,480
necessarily your opinion on this thing

790
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,840
right your leadership

791
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,360
and those that need to make decisions

792
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,039
based on your analysis

793
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,159
uh want to hear what your conclusion is

794
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,559
they don't want to hear the facts and

795
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,760
one of the things that was really hard

796
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,840
for me to understand early on was

797
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,279
sometimes you need to be very honest

798
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,080
about

799
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,120
not knowing you know what happened

800
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,400
let's say that for example you try to

801
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,760
investigate an event and you realize

802
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
that you did not have

803
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,840
the visibility into that specific

804
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,320
log that would have told you if this was

805
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,600
a false positive

806
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,760
or a true positive well that's

807
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,440
definitely a huge takeaway

808
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,279
from the investigation and hopefully

809
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,480
there's a way that

810
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,039
you can you know inject that information

811
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,600
into

812
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
your visibility improvement process you

813
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,279
know as a sock

814
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,960
so that's just something to keep in mind

815
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,039
as you're creating a conclusion

816
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,760
and this was really hard for me to learn

817
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,880
and that's the bluff

818
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,919
uh i write a lot i talk a lot and i get

819
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,840
really excited about things like this

820
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,480
so it's really important to put a bluff

821
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,080
a bottom line up front

822
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,200
at the very top of your write-up to let

823
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,720
your management know since

824
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,240
you know understanding the audience is

825
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,760
important people are busy

826
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,000
right people are doing things understand

827
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,120
really quickly

828
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,640
uh in a few minutes if that why

829
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,000
they're even receiving this write-up in

830
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,679
the first place why it matters

831
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,760
and of course provide some contextual

832
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,000
data time stamps really important

833
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
uh user endpoint information right so

834
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,760
let's say you have a user account

835
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,600
associated it is that user

836
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
you know what is their job title you

837
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,960
know that may

838
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,200
uh be very interesting for your

839
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,360
leadership what if it's a vip user for

840
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,080
example

841
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,919
uh what if it's a server and any like

842
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,760
related ocean data that you find is

843
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,360
always really helpful to

844
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,520
you know add more to your investigation

845
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,000
okay so the bottom line up front the

846
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,120
bluff here right

847
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,159
um summarize all the key information

848
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,360
put it all into one paragraph all the

849
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,400
way at the top

850
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,559
and i try to remind myself of the three

851
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,760
c's and that is

852
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,120
to be concise clear and correct be

853
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,760
try to use active voice try not to

854
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,120
passively say things

855
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,400
and be very clear about the information

856
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
and your conclusion about something and

857
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,679
just make sure you're correct right

858
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,120
make sure that you know you didn't

859
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,279
accidentally see say this is a false

860
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,400
positive just because you

861
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
you mistake the you know true and false

862
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,520
word just be very correct

863
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,679
honestly uh i've had to send my reports

864
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,720
or my write-ups to my fellow analysts

865
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,919
and i'm like hey can you read this

866
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,440
really quickly to make sure that you

867
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,320
know it's right

868
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,880
or it sounds good before i send this out

869
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,080
that's also really helpful

870
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,919
again that goes back to leaning you know

871
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,360
on your peers

872
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,880
because you want to make sure that these

873
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,559
three these three c's

874
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,880
are checked in order to make your bluff

875
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,720
statement incredibly

876
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,039
impactful for the writer oh

877
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,080
lastly write up importance

878
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,760
your write-up can invoke change in a

879
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,600
process right that's really important to

880
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,360
understand what if your investigation

881
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,919
led to the discovery of a visibility gap

882
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,960
for example

883
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,720
right and your management or your

884
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
leadership team whomever

885
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,600
they want to reference your

886
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,320
documentation your write-up in order to

887
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,960
invoke this change in order to make a

888
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,039
change in the organization can they just

889
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,840
forward your write-up right is it ready

890
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,679
did you write it with that expectation

891
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,760
or do they have to come back and reach

892
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,279
out to you and ask you for like a

893
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,880
summary of your write-up

894
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
um those are never fun i've had to do it

895
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
before because again

896
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,760
you know this is all a learning

897
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,600
experience um but just

898
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
try to write your write-ups with that

899
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,520
expectation that it may be

900
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,720
used as reference material right another

901
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,279
one here

902
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,120
i said this before can someone replicate

903
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,880
the actions you took can you train

904
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,600
someone

905
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,279
based on this investigation that you

906
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,559
wrote up can you give them this

907
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,480
documentation and ask them hey

908
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,399
um you know see if you can pull these

909
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,000
logs these these

910
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,760
things from this machine like does that

911
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,919
make sense to you and of course

912
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,320
um something else to keep in mind did

913
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,919
this investigation lead to a potential

914
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,520
improvement in detection that's

915
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,840
the whole point right is to continue to

916
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,279
improve our detections

917
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,320
as analysts to make you know our jobs

918
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,880
easier and to protect our companies

919
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,120
so of course would senior leadership be

920
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,720
able to use this write-up to address any

921
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,279
concerns

922
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,880
can be forwarded up that's just a

923
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,440
reminder here and a last question ask

924
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,480
yourself here

925
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,080
did you document your findings or no

926
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
conclusions in some kind of a wiki i

927
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,120
don't know what

928
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
people have out there whatever onenote

929
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,320
i'm not sure

930
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,480
but somewhere that it can be easily

931
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,559
referenced it can be searchable so that

932
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,320
everyone can learn from this process

933
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,600
it's something to keep in mind while

934
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,480
you're doing these write-ups

935
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,760
okay so now we're at summary

936
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,919
questions drive and investigation uh

937
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,200
they're key they're

938
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
you know the questions the quality of

939
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,039
the questions that you ask yourself

940
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,799
um determines the quality of your

941
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,320
investigation just something

942
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,480
really important build an effective

943
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,440
hypothesis

944
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
or remember those three terms that i

945
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,200
used earlier um just

946
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,480
make sure that you spend a little bit of

947
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
time trying to think about what your

948
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,240
thoughts are initially about this

949
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
investigation it really helps drive

950
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,039
everything

951
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,960
so answer to your question form the

952
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,240
foundation of a write-up

953
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,000
it doesn't mean that it is the write-up

954
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,080
it's the foundation and you build off of

955
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,120
that

956
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,640
an analyst reflects their efforts

957
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,320
through write-ups uh

958
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,399
i i love to read that because it's so

959
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,520
true

960
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
the what leadership sees is your

961
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,120
write-ups they don't see the amount of

962
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,000
hours you spent

963
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,919
looking at logs unless you're sharing

964
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,039
your screen and showing them something

965
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
which is always cool

966
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
always include a bluff statement people

967
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,960
are busy you don't want to bore anybody

968
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,520
either

969
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,360
make sure that the information that they

970
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
need is right up front and ready to go

971
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,159
and i'll leave it with just keep asking

972
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,120
questions

973
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,440
it's helped me throughout my career and

974
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,640
it continues to help me

975
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,760
and it's just super important for us as

976
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,679
analysts in the field

977
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,799
and these are some resources um so

978
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,279
i learned a lot from chris sanders

979
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,880
investigation theory course

980
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,240
it's one of the best courses i've ever

981
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,120
taken i mean chris sanders is amazing

982
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,559
and it really helps to understand how

983
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,200
investigations work there's some writing

984
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,080
tips by lenny

985
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,120
um i mean this is perfect uh

986
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,519
a lot of this stuff about like being

987
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,240
more clear and concise comes from that

988
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,120
generating hypothesis robert m lee right

989
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,440
for

990
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,200
thread hunting which is something that

991
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,799
we do all the time as analysts

992
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,559
and one of the most impactful books that

993
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,559
i've read uh is thinking fast and

994
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,080
slow because it really helps you

995
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,679
understand your biases which we didn't

996
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,679
really cover here in this presentation

997
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,000
but like confirmation bias for example

998
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,240
and false positive bias that happens to

999
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,360
a lot of analysts after

1000
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,320
being bombarded by so many bad

1001
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,360
detections

1002
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,080
uh arguably bad detections um and of

1003
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,720
course

1004
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
communicating with intelligence this was

1005
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
a book that i read because of a class

1006
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,960
that i took

1007
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,240
and i was blown away by how

1008
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,480
amazing it was to help with like my

1009
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,240
writing skills so that's another book

1010
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,760
there that i think is really good

1011
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,640
to share and that's it that's all i have

1012
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,080
and of course i mean i want to say thank

1013
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,159
you to everybody uh

1014
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,000
grim everybody i mean this these

1015
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,679
conversations are awesome so

1016
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,279
i really appreciate it that was amazing

1017
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:13,679
thank you

1018
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,279
christopher uh uh that was great uh i'm

1019
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,960
trying to look through uh for some of

1020
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,399
the q a in there

1021
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,720
um somebody it was me since you

1022
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,799
mentioned uh the utc is like

1023
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,679
just set everything to utc uh there's a

1024
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,120
teespring shirt and

1025
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,080
like uh stickers and such for utc or

1026
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,039
gtfo

1027
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,720
which is one of my favorite uh sock

1028
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,399
analysts and forensicator phrases that

1029
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,399
i've heard a few times right

1030
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,600
yes there's there's one correct location

1031
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,799
to set your servers

1032
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,799
network switches etc you can make a

1033
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,720
strong argument for user machines as

1034
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,039
well

1035
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,760
just standardize everything to utc time

1036
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,200
zone conversions is

1037
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,000
so much a pain like oh i'm investigating

1038
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,720
now

1039
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
but when i when the event happened it

1040
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,799
was still daylight savings so let me

1041
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,440
modify for three hours for the location

1042
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,880
difference in another hour for the time

1043
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,760
zone difference

1044
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,360
oh but wait i'm in a county that doesn't

1045
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,880
do time zones so it's only three hours

1046
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
or wait no it's five hour

1047
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,320
just utc everywhere that's one tip that

1048
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,919
by itself justifies

1049
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,320
your talk and there was a lot more all

1050
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,240
the way through as well let's see

1051
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,240
um uh i did want to oh emphasize uh your

1052
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,200
little nugget so i

1053
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,600
i usually writing like pen test reports

1054
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,440
different focus but the same idea of

1055
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,080
conveying

1056
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,559
a message to the the reader or different

1057
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,919
readers at different levels

1058
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,840
and i loved the nugget you said a

1059
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,519
competent reader of the report should be

1060
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,880
able to follow along

1061
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,159
the steps that you actually used yes

1062
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,840
not just anyone outside of it but

1063
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
somewhat someone somewhat familiar with

1064
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,679
another sock analyst or junior stock

1065
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,640
analyst or

1066
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,320
probably even the manager of the sock

1067
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,159
itself should be able to follow along

1068
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,640
and go through the same steps and with

1069
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,919
the same questions because you

1070
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,600
identified them in your report

1071
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,440
should come to the same conclusion

1072
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,640
otherwise there's some

1073
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,120
logical fallacy going on or some bias on

1074
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,559
your own side so

1075
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,360
i love that in other words every report

1076
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,080
could also

1077
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,639
be training material for others because

1078
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
there is not enough time in this world

1079
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,679
for everyone to

1080
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,839
find the answers themselves this is why

1081
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,719
we share

1082
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,359
which may be a recurring theme after

1083
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,800
every little little banter

1084
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,079
that i keep bringing up um so

1085
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,719
first of all thank you the great talk i

1086
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,399
love the the background on i love the

1087
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,440
little nuggets about like

1088
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,119
we didn't have time for biases but it

1089
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,960
turns out they're pretty important

1090
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,918
i completely agree on all parts um one

1091
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,359
question for you

1092
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,800
and this one's always tougher and i

1093
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,560
admit some personal interest here as

1094
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,480
well

1095
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,440
seeing good incident reports is a

1096
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,159
valuable thing

1097
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,679
a lot of them are you know constrained

1098
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,440
to the organization for very obvious

1099
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,079
reasons

1100
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,960
are you aware of any public either good

1101
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,599
examples

1102
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,320
or bad examples of incident reports that

1103
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,639
you

1104
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,000
would point at and say this is an

1105
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,879
available resource

1106
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,800
that's tough um because

1107
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,520
i would have to think about that um one

1108
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,960
of the ways that

1109
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,320
that one one of the things that helped

1110
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
me out very much

1111
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,320
was uh the chris sanders um

1112
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,440
class that he gave and also

1113
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,200
the book that i referenced there that

1114
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,480
for the class that i took

1115
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,640
that was one of the best ways of like

1116
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,480
writing it does it wasn't really

1117
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,040
well it's more about like national

1118
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,720
security and all that stuff right

1119
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,839
but it's super it was super helpful to

1120
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,440
understand like

1121
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,359
your audience and like why you're

1122
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,800
writing this in the first place

1123
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,480
um that was the most helpful thing for

1124
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,000
me but i would have to look to see like

1125
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,200
examples that i can share for that okay

1126
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,880
if you're in discord we'd love to have

1127
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,320
you share it uh it's

1128
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,760
anytime that you you can um

1129
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
commentary uh online shout out to ghost

1130
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,880
305

1131
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
nice presentation i've had to learn to

1132
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
ask questions no matter what

1133
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,960
in the past i felt i might look stupid

1134
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,240
and finally realized

1135
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,200
i don't and shouldn't care knowledge and

1136
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
learning is what is important

1137
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,960
i completely agree there i want to add

1138
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,000
something to that

1139
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,119
that was really hard for me to

1140
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,599
understand too so you know i did not

1141
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,480
have any

1142
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,960
experience coming into infosec right i i

1143
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,599
knew about

1144
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,599
i.t but i wasn't assist admin so i

1145
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,520
wasn't even really that much

1146
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,880
in i.t right i was breaking fixed i.t

1147
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,320
and you know i was so worried about

1148
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,240
asking questions when i first started

1149
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,760
because i didn't want to look dumb

1150
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,400
right no one wants to look dumb right um

1151
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
and what i realized

1152
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,880
over time is that if you have a question

1153
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,720
and it's a big enough group

1154
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
you're probably not the only one that's

1155
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,160
wondering that

1156
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,000
there's just more than one person that

1157
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,599
doesn't want to look dumb

1158
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,480
so if anything just go out there and ask

1159
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,920
that question because you may end up

1160
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,520
helping not only yourself but someone

1161
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,240
else

1162
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,599
you know so that's the way i kind of

1163
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,480
took it yes yes

1164
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,960
um uh which branch do you serve in by

1165
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,200
the way

1166
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,640
what beard bottom line up front so

1167
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,839
military no no nothing

1168
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,240
oh right i would have bet money i would

1169
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,320
have had money in the military

1170
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,359
on that okay no no um that so

1171
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,920
that's really funny you bring that up um

1172
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,480
because

1173
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,800
when i first started in a sock it was

1174
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,599
primarily

1175
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,280
uh you know people that were from the

1176
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,880
military in my team

1177
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,320
so that's probably where all this came

1178
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,240
from i i learned a lot from them

1179
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,280
so there you go i just reflect that

1180
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,599
okay

1181
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
i pretty much i started with the coast

1182
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,320
guard and everything

1183
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,960
uh so yeah it's that's why i learned a

1184
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,160
lot of that stuff like i said my

1185
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,599
military was me by me

1186
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,800
i asked many questions but yeah

1187
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,960
but no oh my god i have so much to say

1188
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,079
about this um

1189
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,680
you know i love it because this is

1190
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,280
something that i i

1191
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
work in and i try to teach you know um

1192
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,760
not really just investigates there but

1193
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
even asking questions and you know

1194
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,880
people who wanted to

1195
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,640
learn i guess more reports now this is

1196
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,079
more from my throat intel side

1197
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,680
i know unit 42 puts out like post threat

1198
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,119
reports i think those are really good

1199
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,079
like

1200
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,400
threat intel reports um i'll put the

1201
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,079
i'll post a link up as well

1202
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,240
um man the biases i know i took a uh

1203
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,560
i think i took a threat intel training

1204
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,320
course right it was it was funny

1205
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,079
it was funny i liked it it was great but

1206
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,839
you know bringing out those biases was

1207
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:28,960
very

1208
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,119
key and critical um especially when we

1209
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,040
were uh we were talking about like hey

1210
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,480
you know do you have biases

1211
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,240
no not really and then put up some

1212
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,160
controversial just pictures

1213
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,680
it wasn't like not safe for work stuff

1214
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,119
it was just controversial like what do

1215
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,480
you think you know what do you

1216
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,079
what is your opinion you know and things

1217
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,520
like that so it really does

1218
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,000
it really helps and um there's a there's

1219
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,359
a huge

1220
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,720
there's a huge thing you like you say

1221
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,320
chris santa's probably one person i

1222
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,280
probably follow

1223
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,640
who really has a lot of this stuff

1224
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,960
almost down to a t uh yeah they've seen

1225
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,560
some other studies when you know even

1226
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,160
writing he was talking about like hey

1227
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
you know any word over like eight

1228
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,680
characters is like too long

1229
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,079
make it simpler if it's over eight eight

1230
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,520
ten k it was it was so

1231
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
deep in in detail in depth and putting

1232
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,040
those reports

1233
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,760
on fancy word where simple one will do

1234
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
jargon is useful if both sides

1235
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,359
understand the same

1236
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,760
term for the same meaning outside of

1237
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,520
that audience which is a really common

1238
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,480
situation

1239
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,440
avoid jargon damn it yes because you'll

1240
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,200
just confuse the audience or worse yet

1241
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,240
they'll walk with a different

1242
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,119
understanding because they have a

1243
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,960
different understanding of that word

1244
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,440
jargon is one of the one of the most

1245
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,880
difficult things for me to learn about

1246
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,960
writing more concisely which is so

1247
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,920
difficult

1248
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,720
um was i like using a lot of the ly

1249
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,440
words

1250
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,000
beautifully right things like that like

1251
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,960
just to make it

1252
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,760
sound nicer because i want it to be

1253
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,560
pretty

1254
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,880
and it ends up being super wasteful and

1255
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,680
no one

1256
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,000
wants to read that and it was so hard to

1257
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,160
understand that you have to be very

1258
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,720
selective with your word choices because

1259
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,400
people don't have time to sit there and

1260
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,839
like read something pretty

1261
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,599
they want to read like the fact yep i i

1262
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,160
actually got

1263
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,440
a client brought it no no uh

1264
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,359
another ciso and uh other uh pentest

1265
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,079
head person uh brought up that i i was

1266
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:16,640
using

1267
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,720
like unfortunately fortunately things

1268
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,400
like to just to chain together sentences

1269
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,040
and

1270
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,920
you're mixing your opinion and that

1271
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,680
flowery language with

1272
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,720
what it should be fairly objective given

1273
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,640
my background given my understanding

1274
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,000
this is the situation

1275
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,119
yes and it's not just that it takes more

1276
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:35,760
words

1277
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,480
it's that to some audiences you are

1278
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,400
diluting your message

1279
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,920
because you're freely trading back and

1280
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,319
forth between this is my casual opinion

1281
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,280
on things and

1282
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,560
this is the fact yes

1283
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,880
so and the goal actually hurting your

1284
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
portrayal of reality sometimes by some

1285
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,720
of that flowery language

1286
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,880
it's okay for things to feel rather

1287
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,560
blunt all the way through

1288
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,839
uh your report is not to uh

1289
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,640
you know swaddle the reader all the way

1290
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,000
through from beginning to end

1291
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,359
it is to lay out a

1292
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,000
a story if you will yes but here's the

1293
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,880
situation

1294
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,480
here's what i understood the initial

1295
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,240
alert to mean here are the follow-up

1296
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,520
questions that it brought to me

1297
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
and here's the resolution conclusion and

1298
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,040
by the way start off with your uh bottom

1299
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,720
line up front your tldr

1300
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,200
for the commercial world um and also

1301
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,920
like

1302
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,520
and also carry out that you know like

1303
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,960
you said chris it's hard to kind of

1304
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,319
write besides i've just shared some

1305
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,040
links

1306
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,440
some things that i use in my job word

1307
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,560
word rake

1308
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,160
is very i love it because it takes those

1309
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,000
really what it does it takes a sentence

1310
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,520
that really worthy and things like that

1311
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,040
like hey cut this out cut this out you

1312
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,400
can still say the same thing

1313
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,079
without doing it something i truly

1314
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,000
invest in in any report i write

1315
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,040
i highly suggest it's like 120 bucks you

1316
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,880
get 150 for like the

1317
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,680
word and uh offers you something i use

1318
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,800
daily because

1319
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,640
it's written for more lawyers per se and

1320
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,240
so lawyers have to kind of use certain

1321
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,119
language but

1322
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,200
it takes all the other extra words it's

1323
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,480
not needed and it makes it really

1324
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,359
concise

1325
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,839
another application i use hemingway

1326
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:08,400
editor

1327
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,520
um it it definitely helps you with uh um

1328
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,680
yeah hemingway's editor it helps you out

1329
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,359
with uh active voice

1330
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,280
that that it put everything as a more an

1331
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,200
active voice also another thing is

1332
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,920
perfected

1333
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,880
um that i use this is more like make

1334
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,240
sure your content is really

1335
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,280
uh uniform you know it is it's

1336
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,440
you know you use ad hoc with the dash in

1337
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,040
the middle or do you just use ad hoc the

1338
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,480
word you know it helps with those little

1339
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,640
things these little nitpicky points out

1340
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,280
so

1341
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,520
these are something that i love sharing

1342
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,119
i love making sure that people

1343
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,960
understand like these tools are out here

1344
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,319
um to help you

1345
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,319
write effectively use the tools that's

1346
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,000
out there to really just narrow things

1347
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,640
down

1348
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,400
and uh to really just make your writing

1349
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,640
clear concise and to the point um

1350
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,240
warwick is probably the number one thing

1351
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,480
i use and then perfected is probably the

1352
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,280
second one

1353
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,040
so definitely something to look

1354
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,280
i just want to echo like one last thing

1355
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,560
here um

1356
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,480
the reason that this is so important is

1357
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,640
again like this is where values derived

1358
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,920
from your analysis

1359
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,760
like this is all at the end of the day

1360
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,599
this is what people see

1361
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,599
um and i failed to see that for so long

1362
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,640
and i'll never forget

1363
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,040
this one report that i wrote i spent i

1364
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,079
don't know

1365
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,520
the whole day writing this report i

1366
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,560
could have sworn it was the best thing

1367
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,079
i've ever written since college or

1368
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:22,560
whatever

1369
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,440
right and i sent it to my my you know my

1370
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,520
lead my new analyst at the time

1371
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,760
and you know they they wrote back in a

1372
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,200
very kind manner it wasn't that they

1373
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,480
were being mean but they were like why

1374
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,599
did you write this

1375
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,280
right and i'm like what do you mean

1376
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,720
right and that's when i fail to

1377
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,000
understand the audience

1378
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,839
very quickly and then they're like i'm

1379
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,119
gonna send you back like

1380
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,640
um my thoughts on it and all i received

1381
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,200
was

1382
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,560
the entire thing was basically

1383
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,960
highlighted and like how

1384
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,119
passive voice was used here like why are

1385
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,960
you giving me your opinion here

1386
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,240
like why is this and that's when i

1387
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,880
realized man this is a craft

1388
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,400
this is something that i really gotta

1389
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,480
get better at i was writing like

1390
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,839
something like i was writing in my

1391
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,040
journal or something i thought it was

1392
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,760
great

1393
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,040
and uh the reality is it takes time

1394
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,000
uh to really get that ironed out it

1395
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,560
really does

1396
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,359
it's not dear diary today i investigated

1397
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,079
an antivirus alert

1398
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,079
hey others because this report will

1399
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,440
stand forever

1400
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,520
regardless of my human context i will

1401
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,119
not be able to explain this report to

1402
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:23,440
you

1403
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,280
these words need to stand on their own

1404
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,079
so dear future readers at this date this

1405
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,920
started a bit of an incident

1406
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,480
and here's the thought process of the

1407
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,760
analyst at the time

1408
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
what data supported what conclusion

1409
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,839
given the questions that came up along

1410
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:38,640
the process

1411
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,000
yes yes definitely what more thinks it

1412
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,319
is

1413
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,640
and i'll let it go i'll let this one go

1414
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,440
but no

1415
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,839
um also in a word when you're writing

1416
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:48,480
your uh

1417
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
documents and work make sure you turn on

1418
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,079
all these spell check features obviously

1419
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,319
there's only a subset on by default

1420
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,599
and honestly a lot of people are going

1421
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,520
to check and

1422
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,560
word has a lot of good grammar check um

1423
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,480
since you mentioned word rake a lot of

1424
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,000
people use grammarly and i had to double

1425
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,920
check word rake and just my my ten

1426
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,280
seconds not

1427
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,200
good review of their privacy policy

1428
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,800
means they they don't actually look at

1429
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,640
the content it's local rules that are

1430
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,359
applied

1431
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,720
grammarly is not that way that is a

1432
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,319
concern to many folk

1433
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,200
that every text you analyze with word or

1434
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,160
powerpoint or

1435
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,240
web browser integration you're sending

1436
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,920
that text to grammarly

1437
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,640
that's probably not okay word break on

1438
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,040
my 15 second review does not do that

1439
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,720
but be careful when you're installing

1440
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,160
other people's software that has

1441
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,119
access to this information because it

1442
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,880
has access to this information it's

1443
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,000
probably not meant to be publicly shared

1444
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
right and so like i mean definitely use

1445
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,839
word

1446
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,400
is something yeah i i personally vouch

1447
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,920
um for people who don't who want a

1448
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,040
grammarly style thing

1449
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,800
what i found to use i use it a little

1450
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,319
bit uh white smoke

1451
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,280
is pretty much the same as gremlin um i

1452
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,560
believe they don't

1453
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,000
if i read it correctly i believe they

1454
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,520
don't you know you don't send your

1455
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,560
information to

1456
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,920
uh white smoke they're like i said

1457
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,200
they're pretty much the same thing as

1458
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,079
family

1459
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,760
uh and as far as like uh grammar content

1460
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,560
and everything but

1461
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,040
you know getting your writing together

1462
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,079
definitely utilize

1463
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,839
the tools out here it's one of the best

1464
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,079
investments i make when writing anything

1465
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,880
from email to report to anything that

1466
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,359
goes

1467
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,560
beyond me or maybe a colleague that

1468
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,560
maybe a colleague of mine i run it

1469
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,400
through word rate first

1470
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,560
uh perfected next to make sure

1471
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,000
everything's uniform and i'm taking out

1472
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,520
all the extra wording

1473
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,680
in there and those i can't highly

1474
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,960
recommend those two

1475
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,520
products that's fair point okay i have

1476
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,960
another thing to look for as well

1477
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,119
so i hope you're i believe you're

1478
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,440
providing uh value to the audience but

1479
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,640
you're providing value to me and that's

1480
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,160
good enough to start off with so i'm

1481
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,119
happy with that

1482
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,040
so uh christopher i need to introduce

1483
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,480
our next section any

1484
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,000
last comment before we switch over no um

1485
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,240
keep asking questions regardless of how

1486
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,359
dumb they might

1487
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,040
seem in your mind just keep asking them

1488
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,640
that's how you get better

1489
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,760
yep i i rephrased slightly in a discord

1490
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,800
post and said uh

1491
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,119
i'd rather appear like a fool for a

1492
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,000
moment and ask

1493
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,319
a stupid question then actually be a

1494
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,240
fool on that subject forever because i

1495
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,680
didn't ask that question

1496
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,880
definitely perfect yep thank you very

1497
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,359
much lopez
