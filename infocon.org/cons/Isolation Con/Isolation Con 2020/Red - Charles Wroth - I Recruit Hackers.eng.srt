49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,000
hopefully some some questions at the end

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,399
right so disclaimer as it goes uh this

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,640
is my personal opinion doesn't represent

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,520
the opinion of

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,200
my employer nor does it represent the

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,280
opinion of my own company

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,759
um so uh just bear that in mind also i'm

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,040
not a

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,840
de facto you know principal authority on

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,160
this is just the information and the

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,680
knowledge i've collated over the last

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
few years

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,120
right so who am i all right so

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,239
uh i basically uh left cape towns africa

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,560
um

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,520
against afghan military didn't work out

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
so i decided to go to the uk to get a a

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
good sort of

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
combat experience um over there so six

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,640
years

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
two years as a gunner four years as a

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,080

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
ehf and hfcoms for companies um

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,879
i then did six years in physical

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
security contracting predominantly

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
in east and west africa a lot of time in

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
mozambique and sierra leone

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,640
and then some time in the middle east as

77
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,200
a bodyguard

78
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,879
okay after that um my sort of we'll get

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,879
into it shortly in my past crossed

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,879
um with someone in infosec and i've been

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,560
working for that person ever since

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,879
i'm currently i'm a uh besides cape town

83
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,080
co-organizer

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
um i mentor the shock on resume program

85
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,680
i do a bit of [ __ ] posting on tmhc and

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
i'm using the main mod

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,400
and then i also run a small

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
group of uh infosec

89
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,879
you know curious people called hacksaws

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,000
uh which is

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,879
it's kind of like tmhc not as glamorous

92
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,080
but it's all for us

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,680
africans in the industry

94
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,720
in summary this is basically me

95
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
my likes and desires and and my

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,799
background

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
right so my path into infosec

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,519
so yeah basically is so i was an army

99
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,519
um i decided to get out the military um

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,120
i went to our careers

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
uh officers managers it's about a

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,720
six-year-old

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
uh former major colonel and i told him

104
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
that i want to get into security um now

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
when i mention security it usually means

106
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,799
physical security because

107
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,760
exactly sort of industry understood um i

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,560
was then told

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
you know why have you completed becoming

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,159
a bricklayer or a carpenter

111
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,200
um and this just didn't fly for me so

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,478
um i started building my information and

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,839
and running my own track

114
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,279
um i then you know

115
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
a lot of guys in my battalion flagged me

116
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
as the guy that has the knowledge and

117
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
does the research so they kept coming to

118
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,759
me asking me the same questions and i'd

119
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,040
give them the same answers but do

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,560
different people

121
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,280
so i set up a facebook group um called

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,639
termination sharepoint

123
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,360
um sharepoint i learned was a bad word

124
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,759
because

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,440
i got a lot of people adding me asking

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
about sharepoint administration

127
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,720
um and through that um we basically

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,639
started off with guys my battalion grew

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,080
to our regiment and then it became a

130
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
tri-service thing

131
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
and then there was also an offshoot in

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
the united states um

133
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,560
through termination sharepoint i was

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,160
introduced to someone

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
who everyone knows now as swordfish or

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
morgan

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,520
she helped me with a few bits there she

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
was a she was an admin for me

139
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
um but after that we kind of lost track

140
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
of each other

141
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,919
and then about three and a half years

142
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,320
ago she introduced me to

143
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,400
the man in the top right marcelo mansour

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,440
he's the ceo

145
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
of red blue security she introduced me

146
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,520
to him saying hey he's coming to cape

147
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:17,919
town

148
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,400
um can i give him a basic overview of

149
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
the security posture in south africa

150
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,759
and in cape town you know where to go

151
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,240
where not to go um i was running a small

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,199
consulting company at that time um he

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,240
came to cape town

154
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
um he asked me what i did i said no do

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
security consulting i asked him what he

156
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
did and he said no he would attack us

157
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,560
for a living and i immediately told him

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,440
you know that's

159
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
that's illegal and i should uh i should

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,039
distance myself from this person i've

161
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,360
always been a law-abiding citizen

162
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,600
from there um he told me about the

163
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,639
industry he told me about

164
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,320
you know defcon he told me about b-sides

165
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,000
talking about the community and the you

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,639
know

167
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,560
the interesting parts about it and i

168
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
found it fascinating and i realized this

169
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,720
is

170
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,240
this is something i've been looking for

171
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,479
for a long time you know i didn't have

172
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,000
i've always had high paying jobs but not

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
a lot of fulfillment

174
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,880
um so moving on from there um

175
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
i joined red blue and now this is my

176
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,440
life a lot of uh tabs on chrome

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,199
uh over usage of my uh my disc on my cpu

178
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,720
so moving on okay you're entering to

179
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,560
infosec

180
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,639
how could this look right there's no

181
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,319
proven route into security

182
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,400
um i literally want you to repeat this

183
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,800
after me um there's very different ways

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,919
uh the term is used as non-linear um

185
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,520
there is so many different ways to get

186
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
in security what i found

187
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,400
in brief is this the there's a few

188
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,919
different tracks so one is university

189
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,560
route so

190
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,520
someone that's studying cs university um

191
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,400
they then you know

192
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
find a hacker meet up or they find

193
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
something uh

194
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,479
community related in the university i

195
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
then get a taste for it

196
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,759
they sometimes change their major get an

197
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,120
internship and start working

198
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,919
professionally

199
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,440
the gamer root which i've seen very

200
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
common you know avid gamers that want to

201
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
be the best they find cheat codes

202
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,560
they end up not being uh happy with the

203
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
chicos and they start learning how to

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
script

205
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,479
and then next you know they're part of

206
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,479
the hakka community

207
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,039
some other bits activism seemed used to

208
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,240
be a popular one

209
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,400
in 2005 2008 um know this is a this is a

210
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
you know a different way to get into it

211
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,120
the uh the key in the activism one is

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,680
obviously

213
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
not to get caught um a lot of people get

214
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,520
influenced

215
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,800
by you know parents or friends um

216
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,319
they have a curious nature and they

217
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,599
start doing research and they start

218
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,639
figuring out stuff and they find

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,400
communities like the mini house club

220
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,800
hacksaws b-sides and go from there

221
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,680
okay re-roll i see this uh quite a lot

222
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,319
it

223
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,560
tends to be the trickier one but it uh

224
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,360
it means

225
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
that someone has a good baseline

226
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
understanding of

227
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,639
uh of uh i.t um and how

228
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,280
networking works sometimes um so this

229
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,639
tends to be

230
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,319
sometimes a tricky transition especially

231
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,479
if you've been you know a cis ad or a

232
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,280
help desk

233
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
individual for a long time sometimes

234
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,039
that transition is tough

235
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,520
um but i see this is a very common one

236
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,639
linear

237
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,479
is the lucky ones that are born into

238
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,960
this age that

239
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,440
are exploited or not exploited that are

240
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
introduced to this industry from an

241
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,840
early age

242
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,960
um so that they could be molded into

243
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,479
you know potentially not being a black

244
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,680
cat and being a force for

245
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,199
um all right let's go

246
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,080
your first step so i i drum about this

247
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
constantly it's community engagement you

248
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,080
know

249
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,719
being here today this is the first step

250
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,120
um

251
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
so congratulations on that i'm getting

252
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,399
involved with community

253
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
um there's obviously usually a lot of

254
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,760
noise a lot of drama especially on

255
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,480
twitter

256
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,760
but getting involved in the community

257
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,839
whether it is on a discord server like

258
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,800
tmhc

259
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,160
hack south um you know laptop hacking

260
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,120
or document or whatever is a good start

261
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,240
because it's a good source of

262
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
information

263
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
and you get a lot of people that can

264
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,279
mentor you um i know there's a there's a

265
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,279
few people on tmhc that really

266
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,519
uh you know do a lot for me and teaching

267
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,880
me basic things

268
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,839
um so you know it's it's it's important

269
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,360
um that also goes for like things like

270
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,640
b-sides like

271
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,760
get involved so if you can't afford to

272
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,320
go

273
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
volunteer for a con um point on that um

274
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,279
it's you know as an organizer you

275
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,399
quickly see who the people are

276
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,680
volunteering

277
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,880
um because uh they want to make the con

278
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,360
happen

279
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
you know they want to be noticed and

280
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
then you get people that volunteer for a

281
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
con because they want a free ticket

282
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,440
um try try and do your bits if you have

283
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
a good organizing team

284
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
you should end up being able to enjoy

285
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
the con you know watching the talks that

286
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,040
you want to watch

287
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,240
um but the idea is you give your time

288
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
and one of the perks is obviously you

289
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,240
know it doesn't cost you anything

290
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,839
if you can't find your own community and

291
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,120
you know your local university then

292
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,920
start one

293
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,360
um there's enough people out there that

294
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
will give you enough advice about that

295
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,200
don't be shy um i remember when i joined

296
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
tmhe i was

297
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,600
uh i was really scared about joining vc

298
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,320
um

299
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,480
i did uh with uh with a friend of mine

300
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,360
sticks

301
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
and slowly slowly surely people started

302
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,800
joining uh voice

303
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
vc and i'm introduced to everyone and

304
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
then i guess i've been uh

305
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,519
i've been on there a lot yeah we're all

306
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,800
weirdos

307
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,399
we all have our insecurities i know

308
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,600
fruit was doing a talk about that

309
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,560
earlier

310
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
um a lot of people always say you know

311
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,440
when they get involved with the

312
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
community they tend to find new people

313
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,720
another thing is upskill take advantage

314
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,920
of free training if there's some free

315
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,360
training out there like i recently

316
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
signed up for an autopsy course

317
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,240
um then go for it um

318
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
abl i always say always be learning this

319
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
is an issue where you constantly

320
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
constantly have to learn i know it's

321
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,120
sometimes daunting

322
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
but if you can do one course a year one

323
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,240
course every two years

324
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
try and do that yeah give if you give an

325
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,440
opportunity

326
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
do some training right for summary

327
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,839
there's no one way into infosec

328
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
tell the most what i mean by that is i

329
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,760
tell my trainer i've told my mom and dad

330
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,640
i've told

331
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,200
my younger cousins like hey there's this

332
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,399
industry out there and

333
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,519
you might enjoy it don't be evil

334
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
basically don't be um i don't know if

335
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,399
it's a peace term don't be an [ __ ]

336
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,200
um there's a lot of people out there

337
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,279
that are a lot more superior to you

338
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,200
in skills and abilities and mindset and

339

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,760

push yourself too far there okay this is

348
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,800
something i'm i'm looking at these days

349
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,760
is

350
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,279
i now have a few skills in cali um i can

351
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
help people that are literally

352
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,480
just just just just getting started um

353
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,399
i can do that because i know a few

354
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,320
little basic things there's a lot of

355
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
people above me that know a lot more

356
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,160
more more than me like sticks or cyber

357
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,120
viking or alan

358
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,040
blank if there's anyone else instead of

359
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
having to ask them the question

360
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
come to me and you know you sort of

361
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,680
climb up the track for the ladder

362
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,120
become part of the conversation part of

363
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,200
the community and there's some

364
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
fewer things you know if you can cfp for

365
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,399
uh for a con do so

366
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,959
um there's a lot of value in it always

367
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,320
be learning

368
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,079
and yeah that's that okay so what

369
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,920
matters this is the the

370
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,200
the the big chunk of my talk um okay

371
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,440
so

372
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
okay so subjects i'll be covering here

373
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,040
is resumes linkedin

374
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,200
applications interviews tech tests

375
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,639
closing twitter

376
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,200
certain education um i have you know i'm

377
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,240
limited for time

378
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,880
this is this is something that i can

379
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,399
talk about and a lot of us can talk

380
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
about for hours and hours

381
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,680
but i try to stick to some of the

382
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,920
pertinent points and there's obviously

383
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,600
some memes for your entertainment

384
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,480
right so what matters on a resume okay

385
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,959
so

386
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,399
resume is the first step in the process

387
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,639
a lot of people fail to realize this

388
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,440
they'll go

389
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,079
you know why is my linkedin not enough

390
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,560
and the

391
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,240
simple fact is that um the resume is the

392
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
is like your professional id card you

393
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
need that resume

394
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,160
to to to get sent over to a company to

395
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,040
you know

396
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
interview for a job so it's important to

397
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,079
have it

398
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,519
okay time on target it is important to

399
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,240
understand

400
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
that if there is a big job with a lot of

401
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,519
applications

402
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,200
people aren't going to open your resume

403
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
and go and spend five ten minutes on it

404
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,800
the first sift in a resume um

405
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,000
you know shortlisting people look i tend

406
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,519
to look for things that

407
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,519
make you not applicable to this job so

408
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,880
short stint you know if you've done two

409
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,079
months here three months here four

410
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:46,800
months there

411
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,079
you're at high risk um i look at

412
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
it sounds bad but i look at the negative

413
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,160
things right after that

414
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,600
is when people will spend time on your

415
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,519
resume and look at it and assess it

416
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,079
and look for the things that make you a

417
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,040
valuable candidate for the job

418
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,199
yeah as an either beholder when i do

419
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,720
resume reviews i always

420
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
push this point it is important to

421
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,839
understand i might think your resume

422
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,440
looks amazing the next recruiter or the

423
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,720
next employer might think it looks

424
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,680
terrible

425
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,839
it literally is not either beholder

426
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
okay one page is great two pages fine

427
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,519
three is not

428
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,560
four's four places north korea

429
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,440
so i find i found a lot of people that

430
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,199
have been in this industry for 20 years

431
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
industry leaders that i've interviewed

432
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,360
that'll manage to squeeze 20 years into

433
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,560
into a one pager

434
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,760
i've then found people that have been in

435
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,279
this industry for two years and have a

436
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,639
six page resume

437
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
um ironically here in south africa the

438
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,040
old tradition was the longer your resume

439
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,839
the better you are i think my old man

440
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,959
used to have a

441
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,760
a 26 page resume and i forced him down

442
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,959
to a one pager

443
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,720
so this is a an important part

444
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,079
yeah okay community engagement

445
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,279
i've you know i've talked about that

446
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,000
quite a bit get involved uh it

447
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,600
what it does is uh your community

448
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,880
engagement so this is you know

449
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,920
volunteering at a con

450
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,760
this is giving a talk at a con or giving

451
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,959
a workshop whatever

452
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,880
it shows commonality it shows that

453
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
you're you know quote one of us

454
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,800
um and it's a good conversation starter

455
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,600
right a resume is a working document

456
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
it's not something you use

457
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,760
every time you need a job right it is a

458
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,120
working document

459
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,839
remember that work on it at least once a

460
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,800
month

461
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,120
if you've done a new course if you've

462
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,920
done

463
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,519
done you know done something at work you

464
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,199
know you just learned about aws or learn

465
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,079
about this

466
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,279
add it to your resume um the the problem

467
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,639
happens is when

468
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,160
your dream job might come up and you

469
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
don't have a resident already and by the

470
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,560
time it takes you a week to get your

471
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,920
resume ready you might have lost

472
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,479
opportunity

473
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,519
okay if and out of your screen what i

474
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,839
mean by this is read your resume and

475
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,120
when you finish resume

476
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
send it to someone that's good with

477
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,240
spelling and grammar um

478
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,360
and make sure it is it is perfect

479
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,959
um a lot of times i'll get very

480
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,639
frustrated people that have spelling and

481
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,160
grammar errors

482
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,959
um photo okay so the the contest on the

483
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,800
photo this is my personal consensus

484
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
um don't include a photo unless it's an

485
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
amazing photo professionally done

486
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,440
uh can a photo help yes but can a photo

487
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,800
be to your detriment

488
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,160
yes it can as well a photo as another

489
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,279
layer

490
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
that um a recruiter or an employer

491
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,560
can judge you on whether consciously or

492
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,639
subconsciously a photo

493
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,440
can add a bad layer um so remember that

494
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,560
okay personal

495
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,000
uh per sec or opsec

496
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
when it's important include your address

497
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
i the city

498
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,279
and the state you live in do not include

499
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,399
your home address

500
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,959
do not include a you know 152

501
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,399
summerfield lane

502
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,800
just say cape town south africa san

503
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,560
francisco california

504
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,480
that is all you need to put in there

505
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
don't don't

506
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,480
don't give more information than you

507
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
need to basically

508
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,319
okay layout you know this is this is a

509
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,240
tough one i i don't have one specific

510
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,280
layout i look for

511
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
but layouts are important make sure you

512
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,319
have something that is new that is

513
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
new age i mean a lot of people have

514
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
developer resumes

515
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,839
um so there's there's various uh things

516
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,199
you can look at there

517
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,280
color use color i really don't think

518
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,039
color is a problem i like color it

519
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,079
highlights certain

520
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,240
different things what's there to talk

521
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,760
about so this is about

522
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,600
um leaving not including everything in

523
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
your resume so leaving something to be

524
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,480
discussed during an interview

525
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,559
yeah we've covered that okay long

526
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,679
service breakdown

527
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,720
um a lot of people if they've been at a

528
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,320
company for 12 years will have one

529
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,520
little bit if you've been uncomfortable

530
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,240
12 years

531
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,320
you know if you've been you start off as

532
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,440
an analyst and you became a secure

533
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,559
engineer and now you're

534
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,559
a staff security engineer i would break

535
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,760
those up it shows

536
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,360
that you promoted well it shows the

537
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,960
timing in which you promote it

538
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,360
it it once again it adds a lot of value

539
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,799
to yourself

540
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,919
ten year legacy so

541
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,360
is it important to include something

542
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,039
that you did ten years ago

543
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,120
it depends on what it is if ten years

544
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,400
ago you used to

545
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,360
the pizzas not really relevant if what

546
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,000
you did

547
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,320
10 years ago military service or you

548
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,080
know working intelligence community

549
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,880
then i would say include it but if it

550
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,160
starts getting to the five ten year

551
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,600
point in the past

552
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,799
what a lot of people do just have the

553
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,640
company they work for the title

554
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
and then the year if the company is

555
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,840
interested in it they'll ask about it

556
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
okay so at the top of your resume you

557
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,280
have a summary

558
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,400
there's three points you want to cover

559
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
there what you did

560
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,919
what you're doing and what you want to

561
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,000
do in the future some resumes don't have

562
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,760
a summary i'm

563
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
you either have a summary or not it's

564
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
irrelevant to me if you are

565
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
transitioning or trying to get into

566
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,200
security

567
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,200
i strongly suggest having a good summary

568
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
okay yeah as i mentioned earlier when do

569
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,280
you work in a resume i would say touch

570
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,919
your resume

571
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,520
at least once a month one every once

572
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,120
every three months tinker it

573
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
adds stuff okay lead hackers

574
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,760
so the important thing is technical

575
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,559
ability

576
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,200
but do not overstate it you will get

577
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,840
caught out

578
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,679
especially the company as a tech test

579
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,799
especially if the people that are

580
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,320
working that are interviewing you

581
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,000
are far superior to you in a technical

582
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,480
ability state what you can do

583
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
but never never overreach never

584
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,360
overstate just

585
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
okay so a lot of people ask me how do i

586
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,480
display technical stuff to a

587
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,400
non-technical recruiter so

588
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
i found this on a few resumes and i

589
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,320
found it to be the best way to do it

590
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,280
right so quickly on top of your resume

591
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,160
you build a table

592
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,440
with two columns and let's say

593
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,280
uh or two two rows five columns six

594
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,240
columns right

595
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,000
on the left you put the subject matter

596
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,280
so pen testing

597
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,720
and next state you will list everything

598
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,160
that you touched or that you have

599
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,520
experience in

600
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,520
in the right hand column this helps

601
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,600
on a keyword search this helps on a

602
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,640
boolean search

603
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,039
this help if your resume gets passed in

604
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,200
an applicant tracking system

605
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,799
this helps a non-technical critter

606
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,480
understand like oh

607
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
this person ticks a lot of these boxes

608
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,840
so they must be good i myself a

609
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
technical recruiter so i understand the

610
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,159
nuances

611
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,919
and what what adds value and what does

612
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,159
not

613
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,320
okay and these are just some really bad

614
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,280
resume memes i found on my journeys

615
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,360
okay linkedin use your linkedin summary

616
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,679
as a two to three paragraph resume so

617
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,200
when you whenever when a

618
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
profile comes up you can only see a few

619
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
lines of your summary or you have to

620
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
click more to see the rest

621
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,520
use that as like a imagine you had to do

622
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,360
a tweet and in that tweet well

623
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
you had to put your resume like the

624
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,120
pertinent points of view

625
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,240
it's important to have a summary list

626
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,760
yeah who you are what your skill sets

627
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600

from people i have managed and from our

638
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,799
teammates

639
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,960
it all adds a lot of value i quickly

640
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,480
want to touch on skill so that you know

641
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,080
on linkedin there's a thing we can add

642
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,640
skills

643
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,400
various words people endorse you for

644
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,840
there is no value to that

645
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,039
except one thing right and that is

646
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,280
that you can list a lot of words there

647
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,640
that will come up on a keyword

648
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,320
search when uh when we do a search on

649
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,080
linkedin for you which i'll show you

650
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,440
shortly

651
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,120
okay so what are recruiters sees okay so

652
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,840
i pay we pay a lot of money for linkedin

653
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,440
probably about 20 30 000

654
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,360
a year that gives us access to every

655
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,200
profile that exists on linkedin

656
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,960
irrespective of our degrees of

657
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
connection

658
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,559
i can search these metrics to find what

659
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,919
i'm looking for

660
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,760
do i use all of these no i do not i

661
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
actually use very few of them

662
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,200
as a search starts you start a very

663
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
specific search you'll search people

664
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,000
only in a certain city and state you

665
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
will search only certain skills only

666
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
certain certs

667
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,320
levels of degrees whatever and as the

668
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,440
search goes on

669
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,200
and you filter through people you

670
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,720
broaden the search

671
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,880
all right so that's what happens when i

672
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
run the search it brings up this

673
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,919
right it brings up this uh the the

674
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,240
cr the search on san francisco skill

675
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,360
oscp

676

i start on the right uh so these are

679
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,280
company connections so as companies i

680
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,000

people work there the next is open to

682
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,600
new opportunities which is something

683
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,080
we'll cover

684
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,400
shortly so that's the top real thing on

you know i'm open to new opportunities

687
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
then more likely to respond does it says

688
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,799
in the 10

689
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,520
it's basically people that um linkedin

690
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
algorithm has shown to respond to end

691
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,240
males

692
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,120
and the the the total amount of

693
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,880
candidates is there 71.

694
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,960
point to note linkedin the linkedin

695
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,000
algorithm

696
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,799
is terrible i still say i wish uh

697
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,480
linkedin would hire a former head of

698
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,159
search from google to help them with

699
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,600
algorithms but you know

700
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,520
say la vie okay

701
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,039
open to new opportunities this is a

702
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,400
valuable tool if you're looking for a

703
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,880
gig

704
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,559
right if you have premium there's more

705
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,000
options but this will look like so

706
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,120
on your profile you'll see you can

707
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,240
show yourself as opportunity

708
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,159
opportunities point to note

709
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,159
people that have the system that i have

710
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,840
recruiter professional services can see

711
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,480
that

712
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
no one else can if you're worried about

713
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
your company seeing it

714
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,320
i think they've set a filter that people

715
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,919
in the same company can't see your

716
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,720
profile

717
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
doesn't mean there's they can't work

718
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,480
around it um but it only shows to

719
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,720
recruiters

720
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
you can list if you just have the free

721
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
version you can list five job titles

722
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,120
five job locations and you can select

723
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,360
full-time contract or part-time

724
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,200
this was just me as if i was looking for

725
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,039
a gig now um

726
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,960
you had a security physical potentially

727
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,080
and then when this is what it looks like

728
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,360
um

729
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,400
let me show you here it will come up i

730
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,279
haven't actually got it

731
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,039
it will come up on your profile to top

732
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,440
your profile

733
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
so once again when i run a search and

734
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,200
say now search san francisco

735
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,960
the word san francisco will be highlight

736
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,480
and yellow and will stand out the more

737
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
times you have a word that picks up in

738
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,919
the search the higher up in the search

739
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,960
results you are right so i think that is

740
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,679
linkedin

741
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,799
right applications

742
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,279
i will touch on this briefly so it's

743
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,640
important to understand

744
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
what to apply for should you apply for

745
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,159
every job out there

746
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,760
i really don't think so i think it is

747
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,720
important to be more meticulous right

748
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,320
you have to be interested in the job but

749
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
instead of working the company all right

750
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,600
and it's all important to understand who

751
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,360
wrote the job description there

752
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,120
some amazing job descriptions out there

753
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,039
there are some terrible ones

754
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,960
the company it's important to remember

755
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,559
who writes this thing sometimes it'll be

756
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,760
a hr representative

757
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,440
sometimes it'll be i have clients that

758
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,880
use technical writers just

759
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,600
writing job descriptions um it's

760
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,880
important to also note

761
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,480
one job description does not equal one

762
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,000
job a lot of times there'll be a job

763
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,120
description

764
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,960
for five positions at a company and

765
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,480
they've kind of amalgamated it

766
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,240
right so it's it's important to remember

767
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,440
that because you'll think oh but i've

768
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,880
got to have this skill and that skill

769
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,919
and that skill

770
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,559
if you fit about 50 of that jobs job

771
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,440
description

772
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,120
you're good to go right so this is an

773
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,039
article um that i read recently that

774
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,600
said

775
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,559
that uh women tend to apply for a job

776
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,080
when they fit hundred percent of the

777
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,360
criteria

778
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,679
and men will apply when they hit six

779
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,039
percent of criteria

780
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,559
in my belief if you believe in your

781
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,400
heart of hearts you can do that job

782
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
right apply for it if you think you're

783
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,720
reaching to get that job

784
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,400
don't be too disheartened when you get

785
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,640
rejected all right it's just part of it

786
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,159
and the this was some other stuff i

787
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,840
found i've got the link at the

788
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,440
at the end there was an article done by

789
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,159
an executive from linkedin

790
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,640
okay interviews what matters okay so

791
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,919
interviews can go down

792
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,360
in various different ways a

793
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,120
people it could be a zoo meeting it can

794
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
be a webex it can be whatever

795
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,320
right it might your first if you might

796
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,279
be face to face so it's important to

797
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,039
prepare yourself for that if you know if

798
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,320
you're gonna do a zoom meeting

799
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,919
don't ask him is it gonna be video just

800
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,400
be prepared for that okay

801
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,360
um sometimes you might have to do a zoom

802
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,880
call and you might have to do a tech

803
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,799
test with like a virtual machine so be

804
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,559
ready for that

805
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,600
treat every interview like it's your

806
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,080
dream

807
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,120
job all right i found it recently that

808
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,159
i have send people jobs

809
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,279
right they have then interviewed with

810
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,679
that interview because they as you know

811
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,760
they they have many interviews with

812
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,799
various different companies

813
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,880
but they don't treat each one especially

814
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,480
if you can't treat one specially maybe

815
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,760
space them out more so you have more

816
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,000
time

817
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,919
to prepare but what you don't want to

818
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,200
happen is is

819
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,000
you to fail the interview because you

820
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,279
weren't prepared or you didn't know

821
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,039
anything about the company

822
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,720
and then afterwards you realized it was

823
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,559
a tremendous opportunity it was a very

824
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,000
high paying job with really

825
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,440
good perks in that in that case

826
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
you are literally the only one to be

827
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,120
that failed there so

828
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
treat every job like it's it's it could

829
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,360
be a dream job

830
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,480
um right so three knows and i've seen

831
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,080
this before

832
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,559
if if someone like me sends you a job an

833
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,559
offensive security engineering position

834
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,240
at a company all right

835
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,399
don't try prove your worth before you

836
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,919
are asked to do so

837
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,640
right when you're doing if you you can

838
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,399
do oh synth on the on the company and

839
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:36,720
the

840
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,919
the people interviewing you but keep it

841
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,480
keep it at a very high level don't start

842
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,320
checking what their passwords are and

843
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:44,960
don't start

844
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,520
looking for them on leaked websites it

845
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,960
it can creep someone out

846
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,399
very quickly um so yeah

847
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,399
as i say they show your abilities when

848
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,279
you are asked to do so

849
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,120
okay video conferences make sure you

850
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,000
wear pants be yourself hundred percent

851
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,640
and remember it's a two-way range okay

852
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,360
so in an

853
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
interview it's important to note the

854
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,360
company is seeing if you're a suitable

855
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,880
candidate for them for the position

856
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,919
they're looking at your technical

857
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:12,720
ability

858
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,480
you're if you're a culture fit and

859
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,320
they're looking at your background

860
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,000
but it's important to remember as i said

861
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,080
there it is a two-way range

862
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,240
you are assessing the company as much as

863
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
they are assessing you

864
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,320
all right so keep that in mind if you

865
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
have questions on the interview ask

866
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,960
questions

867
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
um it's it's it's something that people

868
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,080
fail to realize

869
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,320
you you are in a power seat as well it's

870
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,600
not that the company

871
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,799
no matter how many people on the

872
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,880
interview panel you also

873
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,240
possess and hold power

874
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,679
and these are some things to look at you

875
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,960
know do i have a good manager what are

876
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,640
my team members like what are the perks

877
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,240
for the company there's there's various

878
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,679
things to consider

879
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,600
okay another thing that i find some

880
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,200
people do some people don't communicate

881
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,080
with your recruiter

882
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,720
we are not just you know pimps of the

883
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,000
infosec industry some

884
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,720
are but a lot of us are not right i

885
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,360
myself

886
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,600
i do forget people i have i invest tools

887
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,279
and systems to remember people and to

888
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,240
check into people

889
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,080
but i try record as little information

890
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,600
about people as i can

891
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,960
stay in touch with recruiter if the

892
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,080
client sometimes

893
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,679
the client will speak to the recruiter

894
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,960
to get your availability for an

895
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
interview and then it will be like a

896
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,399
like a little love triangle going on

897
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,880
sometimes it is the recruiter will know

898
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,320
that it's better if you just work

899
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,159
directly with a company but remember

900
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,919
that company might be hiring a thousand

901
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,600
people they haven't got time to speak to

902
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,720
us the recruiter

903
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,880
to say hey this interview's been blocked

904
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,640
hey this was a reschedule

905
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,159
something happens if the recruiter has

906
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,720
signal or email or whatsapp or whatever

907
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,360
just drop them a message um and say hey

908
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,200
got an email from the client

909
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,960
they want to reschedule or email from a

910
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,279
client they are moving to the next phase

911
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,880
and that way the recruiter can also pull

912
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,200
information from the from the client

913
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,399
and if you're having trouble with the

914
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,520
process to the recruiter

915
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,200
okay what matters in tech test tech

916
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,640
tests are tricky one

917
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,000
i have seen various different tech tests

918
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,080
some of them will be a hacker rank test

919
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,360
some of them will be a 24 hour ctf with

920
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,600
a

921
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,919
executive report afterwards and another

922
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,600
summary afterwards

923
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,960
prepare yourself for it to be crazy

924
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,559
all right and hope that it's not

925
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,720
yeah i said yeah yeah sometimes on tech

926
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,399
tests you'll be asked to write to report

927
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,240
some companies will send you like a 24

928
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,720
hour cta

929
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,120
the exam works some will give you three

930
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,559
different ctfs

931
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,559
of 12 hours there's such a white

932
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,120
wide mix usually companies use their own

933
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,320
um

934
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,600
virtual machines or their own sort of

935
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,000
ctf challenges um

936
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,279
some companies don't know use hack the

937
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,840
box they'll use stuff for vuln hub

938
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,760
you know if you've if you've done

939
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,039
something on volnhub

940
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,880
um that they sent you you know that

941
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,520
you've hit the jackpot

942
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,640
okay closing the deal

943
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,399
okay points to consider before accepting

944
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,760
an offer

945
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,080
does the job fit your skills and fit

946
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,240
your abilities

947
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,679
if they do not do not accept an offer

948
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,720
if they if if you are doubting if you're

949
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,919
going to be good at this job

950
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,640
speak to the company right a lot of

951
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,080
times they're not going to see that as

952
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,240
you don't have confidence they're going

953
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
to see that as you being humble

954
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,480
right and if they are thinking that it

955
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,200
is a reach

956
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,559
they will probably tell you like look

957
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,559
this is a this is going to be a big

958
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,519
challenge for you but

959
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,760
we believe you can do it right don't

960
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,640
doubt yourself

961
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,840
but just have confidence in what you do

962
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,640
but don't don't go for something that

963
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,159
you know you managed to blag your way

964
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,039
through the interview because what's

965
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,399
happening is you're gonna start that job

966
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,679
and you're probably gonna get terminated

967
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,679
within a month

968
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,360
does the company match your ethics and

969
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,279
culture if

970
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,360
i found with like a lot of veterans in

971
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,559
the us when they

972
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,080
in a hardcore hacker company they

973
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,480
they struggle with a culture make sure

974
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,159
the culture is a fit for you

975
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,399
right and then obviously do i get on

976
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,919
with the company

977
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,240
so it's important to note this right

978
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,440
there's three parts

979
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,799
you need to consider the short term

980
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,799
medium and the long term gain

981
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,279
short term gain is the salary the perks

982
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,679
the benefits all that stuff

983
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,760
the medium is what am i going to gain

984
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,720
from this job

985
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
technically and the long term is the

986
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,399
most important thing you got to think

987
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,159
about how this company and how this job

988
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,880
is going to look on your resume

989
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,720
how will the title look on your resume

990
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,159
and what value does it bring to your

991
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,279
future

992
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,840
um i feel that that part is the most

993
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,039
important especially if you're going to

994
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,799
make a career out of this

995
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,559
yes you might want to take you might

996
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,559
want to take a high paying job now

997
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,880
but maybe the job is over in nine months

998
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,679
or maybe

999
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,200
something happens with an unstable

1000
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,000
company it is important to think about

1001
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,360
that long-term thing when i was a

1002
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,159
contractor i

1003
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,919
look at what do they pay me per day

1004
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,840
versus what the circumstances are

1005
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,279
and i've worked in some really crazy

1006
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,760
places um and then what does the value

1007
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,279
of this in my resume

1008
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,720
and especially when you have competing

1009
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
offers that that last part

1010
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,519
tends to be the the tipping scale

1011
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,519
okay money talking agencies quickly

1012
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,440
about this people ask me do you talk to

1013
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,559
a recruiter about money

1014
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,039
the answer is if you trust the recruiter

1015
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,080
and you believe they have your best

1016
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,039
interests in heart

1017
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,200
yes talking about what you earn talk to

1018
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,799
them about what you're looking for

1019
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,679
but most importantly in that discussion

1020
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,600
try get a bracket from them about

1021
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,399
what is on offer usually it's what my

1022
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,399
dad always says it's whoever talks

1023
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,279
loser whoever to expose whoever talks

1024
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:33,760
first

1025
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,039
loses okay discuss money with them

1026
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,480
right if you've been in a job for six

1027
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,399
years you deserve a decent pay jump

1028
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,880
right but it is important to understand

1029
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,799
what number they are sending you over at

1030
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,640
sometimes i will send people over and

1031
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,080
say we didn't talk about money sometimes

1032
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
i'll say hey this person is looking for

1033
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,000
150 000. okay make sure you know what

1034
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,039
that number is

1035
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,720
okay because some recruiters will bump

1036
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
it because the higher you get paid the

1037
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,159
higher we get paid

1038
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,679
um so that's that's important

1039
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,640
okay twitter very quickly about twitter

1040
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
get involved

1041
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,800
uh who to follow i say follow the best

1042
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,918
follow the noobs

1043
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,440
follow a lot of people don't follow the

1044
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,359
rest of this i sometimes fail at this

1045
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,440
but don't talk about sex politics or

1046
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,399
religion

1047
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,399
turn air or dead laundry and don't troll

1048
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,679
people if you want to troll people set a

1049
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,960
patrol account

1050
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,399
when it comes to do laundry you'll see

1051
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,918
on my twitter every now and then i will

1052
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,839
post the words i will not get involved

1053
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,079
with

1054
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,918
african politics and that's where i want

1055
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,079
to say something but it just isn't the

1056
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,399
place

1057
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,760
okay quickly about certifications

1058
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,000
right when do you do a course well if

1059
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,760
you have a budget from your company

1060
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,879
do a course okay you have to think about

1061
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,800
the value you're going to gain from it

1062
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,639
and there's very decent options as i've

1063
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,079
i've shown here okay always check with

1064
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,200
your company to see if they have an

1065
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,800
educational reimbursement uh

1066
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,040
program a lot of our clients have five

1067
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,400
thousand dollars ten thousand dollar

1068
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,160
educational reimbursement programs

1069
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,760
so you do the course once a year for the

1070
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
company okay

1071
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,280
it's important to understand when you're

1072
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,440
doing a course especially something uh

1073
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,119
like with offensive security okay

1074
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,200
think about the methodology of what you

1075
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
are doing all right

1076
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,800
do not think about getting that piece of

1077
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,160
paper to put on your linkedin put in

1078
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,040
your twitter

1079
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,680
yes there is value in that okay but you

1080
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,880
need to understand

1081
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,839
the the bigger picture of the course

1082
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,800
you're doing

1083
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
the the challenge you're gonna face in

1084
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,800
that course right because if you don't

1085
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,240
you will not be able to apply what

1086
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,359
you've learned in that course in the

1087
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,920
real world

1088
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,079
okay and yeah as always guys if you

1089
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,440
can't if you can't afford a course do

1090
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,960
your course do what this guy does with

1091
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
the bella clover just

1092
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,760
hack the planet and figure it out as you

1093
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,240
go along

1094
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,839
okay short term long term

1095
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,280
uh a medium term this is something i've

1096
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,359
already discussed right the decision's

1097
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,720
always going to be about the money the

1098
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,520
job and the resume

1099
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,520
running low on time okay so

1100
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,800
if you give me one second i will check

1101
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,680

1102
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,640
i've done this fairly hard right okay so

1103
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,520
tips and summaries

1104
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,119
different kind of tips but anyway okay

1105
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,240
recruiter 101

1106
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
it's important to understand how a

1107
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,280
recruiter works

1108
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
okay like i've discussed you today to

1109
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,400
understand they they

1110
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,680
they the reason why they do this but i

1111
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,359
don't do this to buy porsches and buy

1112
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,079
ferraris

1113
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,800
and live la vida loca i'm doing this as

1114
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,960
a job as anyone else would

1115
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,720
you know to feed my family maybe go on a

1116
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,400
nice holiday in decembers with my

1117
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,720
daughter and my missus

1118
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,320
and and to take care of ourselves this

1119
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,079
is not there's a lot of recruiters out

1120
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,560
there making a ton of money

1121
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,160
i do this because i have a passion for

1122
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,680
it i've often

1123
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,760
probably seem like a terrible recruiter

1124
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,960
because um

1125
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,480
a candidate in mind will have three

1126
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,640
offers of which one of them are mine and

1127
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,400
i'll tend to advise them

1128
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,720
on a taking another offer because it's

1129
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,160
going to be better for the career

1130
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,079
i believe you know karma that will come

1131
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,520
back to me

1132
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,720
get involved with the community as i

1133
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,119
mentioned before i hit on this a lot

1134
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,480
always be learning

1135
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,920

1136
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,720
training do training

1137
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,400
help the less experienced and learn from

1138
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,000

1139
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,079
i am i am a testament to this i'm doing

1140
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,760
this you know the guys that teach me

1141
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,560

1142

set up a vm how to set up cali how to

1144
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,560
basic commands i know i'm sometimes a

1145
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
pain in that's about it but

1146
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,160
it's important to do that and i know one

1147
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,680
day there's going to be someone that

1148
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,280
just found out about this community that

1149
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
i can say hey

1150
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,200
this is how kale linux works this is how

1151
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,720
you know basic commands work and once

1152
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,760
they have mastered that

1153
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,119
you know i could pass them on to someone

1154
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,200
more advanced than me

1155
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,520
treat every job like it's a dream job

1156
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,359
you do not want to regret

1157
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,119
doing badly at an interview because you

1158
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,880
didn't prepare right

1159
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,320
and you found out that one of your

1160
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,920
friends got that job and it's

1161
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,280
literally your dream job okay always

1162
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,520
treat it as if it could be

1163
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,680
if you trust your recruiter talk money

1164
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,280
okay but

1165
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,119
don't only think about the short-term

1166
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,320
gains think about your career

1167
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,119
do not bypass your recruiter usually our

1168
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,880
contracts are stipulated in such a way

1169
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,359
that if you bypass the recruiter okay

1170
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,599
we'll still get paid it creates a very

1171
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,880
bad situation

1172
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,040
between a recruiter client if recruiter

1173
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,480

1175
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,280

1176
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,680
send to recruiter that's automated

1177
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,119

oscent the job and bypass them it

1180
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,760
experience

1181
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,480

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,440
i don't know why i put the giffy one in

1184
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,839
there but anyway

1185
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,680

1186
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,599
there's any uh any questions i don't

1187
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,000
know

1188
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,720
how much time we have uh how much time

1189
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,920
you have left maybe

1190
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,720
rick can assist me with that all right

1191
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,680
like we have

1192
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,320
literally about two minutes so uh

1193
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,280
is there anyone out of question when i

1194
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,320
have a question

1195
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,240
from empez when seeking for candidates

1196
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,480
why does a recruiter put millions of

1197
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,599
requirements

1198
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,000
that will overroam the candidate and

1199
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,839
push them away

1200
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,599
it does happen a lot um i try to i try

1201
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,000
to advise companies that

1202
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,680
if they have a three-page job

1203
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
description it is just going to scare

1204
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,040
people off i always find

1205
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,359
when i read a job description it can

1206
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,200
usually summarize in about five or six

1207
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,160
lines

1208
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,440
um so don't be too disheartened remember

1209
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,079
what i said

1210
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,839
one job description doesn't equal one

1211
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,119
job usually

1212
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,440
okay sometimes that one job description

1213
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,680
can equal five different jobs so

1214
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,079
maybe you're strong at a third of that

1215
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,000
job description but weak at the rest

1216
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,520
tranzol they'll hire you for that

1217
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,040
one-third because you're specialist in

1218
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,440
that

1219
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,880
and they'll hire two other people to

1220
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,119
cover the rest not always the case

1221
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,160
but it's it's important to remember that

1222
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,480
all right angus well thank you so much

1223
