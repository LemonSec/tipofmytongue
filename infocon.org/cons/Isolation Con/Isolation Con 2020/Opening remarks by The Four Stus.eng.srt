00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,069
complete history of hacking and freaking

59
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,130
so really cannot wait for that as well

60
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,360
and I'll be doing a pretty of an inch

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,709
right there and I've seen some of his

62
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,709
stuff as well that he's doing it proves

63
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,590
to be a really in-depth and exciting

64
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,739
talk so there's lots going on uh really

65
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:50,110
I want to kind of talk a bit about who

66
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,370
we are and how this came about because

67
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,830
for anyone doesn't end many hats Club

68
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,660
we're a disc or community we've been

69
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,580
around for about two-and-a-half years

70
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,640
now which has absolutely flown by we're

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,410
you know we're about eight thousand just

72
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,880
surpassed eight thousand members and

73
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,560
we're a discord partner community as

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,080
well so we get some some cool stuff

75
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,640
happening there and sort of server perks

76
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,110
and all this kind of great stuff but but

77
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,569
primarily it's about us giving back to

78
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,099
the community about us providing

79
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,870
opportunities to people to collaborate

80
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,859
to share ideas we have a podcast which

81
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,989
we've had like a load of guests on about

82
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,280
a hundred episodes in I think or

83
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,880
something like that

84
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,160
everyone everyone you know in the

85
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,870
industry you may know from tinker sector

86
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,310
Dave Kennedy to some of the podcast

87
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,480
guests actually at some of the talks

88
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,480
we've got today and and you know we have

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,190
lots of things that we do and we just

90
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,109
want to give back all the time so we've

91
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,609
done charity events before we we

92
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,069
co-hosted the beer farmers back on one

93
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,630
last year which raised lots of money for

94
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,389
charity before that and Dave Kennedy was

95
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:49,900
very kind to donate us five derbycon

96
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,000
chickens which we then auctioned off for

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,650
charity raise money for innocent or

98
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,170
diner initiative and many other kind of

99
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,780
organizations as well so you know we're

100
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,180
always about trying to raise money where

101
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,150
we can and this seemed like a perfect

102
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,280
opportunity so you know we're really

103
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,319
we're lucky and really thankful for

104
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,760
everyone it's actually can come here

105
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,980
today who's donated or supported our

106
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,950
cause or offer to help else always

107
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,298
participating in the CTF so people like

108
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,858
offensive security who've donated two of

109
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,280
their

110
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,350
two of their computer became anxious to

111
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,000
us big shoutout to TJ null 2.3 for

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,590
hosting our CTF they've done a really

113
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,140
awesome job and that's kicking off quite

114
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,900
nicely I think I saw by 80 plus people

115
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,150
scored so far and on that CTF and I know

116
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,130
that's about 150 people signed up plus

117
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,810
when I checked last night so that's

118
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,720
really good an RSS risk as well for

119
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,340
actually being our very first donator

120
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,320
and sponsor donator as well so really

121
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,220
really thankful but we are doing this

122
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,440
for a reason and the main reason we're

123
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,940
doing this is to raise money for

124
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,960
medicine soundfont ears or MSF or aka

125
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,930
Doctors Without Borders and we want to

126
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,700
raise as much as we possibly can we have

127
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,220
a goal of 10,000 but currently I think

128
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,890
about five seven or five seven something

129
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,510
at the moment I need to check that it's

130
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,770
on the screen and you guys can see it

131
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,140
because you've got the livestream of it

132
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,580
but you know we want to raise as much

133
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,410
money as we can today so if you can

134
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,660
donate anything any small amounts no

135
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,340
matter you know how much it is will be

136
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,740
really appreciated because these guys do

137
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,280
great work all year round their front

138
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,470
line in front of you know when there's

139
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,240
things like outbreaks like the kovat 19

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,190
outbreak as well and like Ebola has

141
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,390
happened in the past these are the

142
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,710
people that the doctors that go out

143
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,870
there and do a lot of that charging work

144
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,880
they put themselves at risk all the time

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,400
and you know this is actually an email I

146
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,220
got back from MSF so this quote here

147
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,410
from Andy Dennis which you can beat it

148
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,510
actually this app is on on on sort of

149
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,310
Friday night after I reached out to them

150
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,590
last week and they said that's a lovely

151
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,419
email actually about how how thankful

152
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:57,560
they are that we're helping them at the

153
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,840
moment so the more that we can do that

154
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,530
the real impact we can actually make so

155
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,230
obviously on do my standing on a soapbox

156
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,940
if you can donate that'd be great it's

157
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,169
what we put this on for free we're

158
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,340
trying to do as much as we can for free

159
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,620
so we can put everything we can into

160
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,080
raising money for this great cause so I

161
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,460
just want to thank everyone again we've

162
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,230
had so many donations so far I just want

163
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,610
to thank everyone again who's donated

164
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,740
and it is really really genuinely

165
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,660
appreciated by myself and everyone here

166
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,540
who's behind the con oh and again like I

167
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,370
said it isn't just they don't just do to

168
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,140
work all over the world and they do some

169
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,350
some amazing things so a really really

170
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,630
important part of this conference and

171
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,370
the whole reason we decided to do it as

172
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,800
well yeah we did try and do a con last

173
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,680
year a physical con and we just realized

174
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,030
it was you know for a community of our

175
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,590
size that we don't make any money we're

176
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,240
not you know profit organization you

177
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,560
know we're just a bunch of people

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,140
working together online to do things and

179
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,310
we've done some quite awesome things

180
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,160
recently and but but realistically you

181
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,680
know we try too big to us we kind of

182
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,450
failed at that so I actually thought

183
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,740
this year we were going to do a virtual

184
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,700
conference because we're an online

185
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,290
community and with everything that come

186
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,150
up and other virtual conferences spun up

187
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,520
no three weeks ago we decided let's do

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,360
it

189
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,160
and yeah it's been an amazing journey

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
and we're really really happy that we've

191
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,740
got here and not just the talks we've

192
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,860
got today there are two awesome after

193
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,450
party activities that are going to be

194
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,510
streamed over three channels so at 21 15

195
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,940
UTC I'd be proud to announce that the

196
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,470
beer farmers pub quiz will be going live

197
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,120
and the link to that pub quiz will be

198
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,920
dropped into the chat the twitch

199
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,760
channels like slightly just before but

200
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,200
things go live so you've got time to

201
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,480
create team or to just sign up to it and

202
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,920
see what happens and we've got some

203

206
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,260

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,470
you it's been some time I think it'd be

303
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,800
starts Manchester I think yeah possibly

304
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,500
but but yeah so Who am I I'm a guy who

305
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,660
does stuff insiders like most of us face

306
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,480

really my passions for secure design and

309
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,370
automation scaling threat modeling that

310
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,819
sort of thing so that's me

311
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:11,050

Coulson you had some things you wanted

319
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,630
to talk about maybe start with some

320
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,360
subjects give us some stuff to natura

321
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,310
about anyway I thought I'd kind of intro

322
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,740
obviously this forced use so we kind of

323
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,440
nicknamed ourselves to come and it also

324
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,730
kind of this Four Horsemen of the

325
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,230
Apocalypse so I have been trying to work

326
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,389
out which ones which I actually spent

327
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:47,889
last night trying to work out which ones

328
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:50,380
death pestilence etc I still not got it

329
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,670
really right so if anyone in the chat

330
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,459
wants to put it which one of us for is

331
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,440
pestilence death except we go for it

332
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,779
that'd be quite fun and we maybe a

333
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,579
Twitter poll or something crazy cuz

334
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,870
someone's gonna do it and know they will

335
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,209
and Schupak will win probably all of

336
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:07,899
them I'm I'll see you about that in

337
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,000
isolation because the weird wonderful

338
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,500
world were in at the moment and I

339
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,660
suppose their question Xiuquan is how

340
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,939
are you actually coping in this weird

341
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,460
wonderful world and then

342
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,010
to stay Kopacz cash or in a really

343
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,320
remote location to where we are so how's

344
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,590
things yeah yeah I am thanks to I'm in

345
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,570
southern Spain and southern Spain as you

346
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,790
know how these difficulties and then

347
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,520
went on real lockdown we can't even go

348
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,130
out to exercise or anything

349
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,170
now the main difference for me I was

350
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,790
already working remote so I was already

351
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,980
prepared for this and I'm I'm a bit of a

352
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,589
hermit anyway to be honest I just am so

353
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,839
it's kind of in some ways it's produced

354
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,180
the world I rather prefer I know that

355
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,760
sounds sick you know I'm pleased pleased

356
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,260
that I don't mean to belittle the

357
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,270
illnesses and deaths of course I don't

358
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,400
but um you know there's less traffic

359
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,710
everything's clean and clear and that's

360
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,800
lovely in that sense um

361
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,020
the children at home and but I've been

362
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,870
teaching Carroll my wife how to teach

363
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,950
now exactly as we are here and to teach

364
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,870
the Spanish teachers to do the same so

365
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,270
in some ways I quite like it

366
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,490
but I know that sounds a bit horrible to

367
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,320
say so you'll have to forgive me on that

368
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,890
one I'm afraid

369
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,460
well allowed an opinion so good opinion

370
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,380
I think would go to the next most remote

371
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,120
person which is Scotland released you

372
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,070
heard he's quite clearly is loving this

373
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,480
because he's on a set of bike who's that

374
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,520
doing work yeah I suppose

375
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,790
similar to just you in Spain I work from

376
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,070
home anyway most of the time so the

377
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,110
weekdays haven't been too different in

378
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,320
terms of routine and structure what I

379
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,580
would say and we had a bit of

380
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,660
conversation yesterday when we were

381
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,700
testing the audio that um these are by

382
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,250
no means normal circumstances no so just

383
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,390
because some of us happen to work from

384
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,339
home normally and we continue to do that

385
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,250
I think there's an underlying stress and

386
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:56,820
anxiety

387
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,089
anyway amongst amongst everybody I know

388
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:01,770
for any of you that about shopping and

389
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,750
just trying to do what you need to do

390
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,220
there's a very strange atmosphere

391
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,730
there's your the merging this it's like

392
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,990
nothing we've seen before and I think

393
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,360
we're trying to get our day jobs done to

394
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,120
the best of our abilities while we move

395
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,440
our way through this madness I think

396
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,209
it's regardless of if you're quite used

397
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,800
to being home a lot the fact that you

398
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,970
can't get out and have some of those

399
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,880
mechanisms normally that you would use

400
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,839
especially at weekends like this which

401
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,709
it's even sewn the in Scotland which

402
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:31,369
brightens our friends me

403
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,120
so yeah I think we're just all getting

404
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,889
by on with it the fact that everybody's

405
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,009
in the same position for me sort of

406
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,149
makes it a little bit easier it feels

407
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,279
like it's not a sliding scale for

408
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,319
anybody it's everybody's going through

409
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:48,459
the same same pain really so yeah yeah

410
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,850
trying our best to just get through it

411
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,959
absolutely gee Peck obviously we've had

412
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,420
Ralph on already and can we just say

413
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,870
massive hats off to your your son there

414
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,910
absolutely nail there's an opener yeah

415
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,829
I'd like to see him onstage in to tell

416
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,690
yourself no definitely self just thought

417
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,759
Ralph nailed it

418
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,050
how's life with you with kids at home

419
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,819
trying to do a day job something yeah

420
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:12,069
you know you're fooling the in in the

421
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:13,870
middle of business at the moment yeah

422
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,610
I've got I've got three kids swell right

423
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,040
so that's and they're all under eight

424
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,880
well yeah eight five and three so so

425
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,250
yeah my house is just like a zoo pretty

426
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,319
much and then it gets trashed and so

427
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,250
yeah it's good

428
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,050
oh so for me it's been quite interesting

429
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,000
so I do work from home occasionally but

430
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,069
given the role that I do so lot the such

431
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,360
engineering the physical so she ain't

432
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,370
doing stuff and I'm quite

433
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,110
customer-facing so I'll go to lots of

434
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,660
talks and lots of events and I'll do the

435
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,420
consulting with customers so it's been a

436
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,120
real promote for a work perspective it's

437
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,829
been a real interesting kind of change

438
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:49,569
because I've taken over a bigger team

439
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:52,149
recently and I've had to consume those

440
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:53,769
and then try and work out or how do we

441
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:56,290
do a lot of these services remotely how

442
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,970
do we then there has been quite easy in

443
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,620
some cases like a governance risk and

444
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,060
compliance project where you're kind of

445
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,410
going and consulting and doing risk

446
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,119
assessments well actually you can do a

447
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,039
lot that remotely anyway and also of

448
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,510
course do it face to face but it's

449
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,859
actually worked out quite nice you can

450
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,929
do things on teams or assume if they

451
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,530
really want to use that anyway and yeah

452
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,720
and so like it's worked out quite nicely

453
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,750
I did a like a nap sec talk to like 200

454
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,049
developers and we got a production crew

455
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,730
in to kind of you know snatch it up a

456
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,339
bit and make it look nice and it works

457
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,190
very well so you know we're kind of

458
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,669
changing things in a business level to

459
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,770
kind of accommodate that to kind of just

460
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,150
get through it and try and work out what

461
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,590
we can still do stuff we're still here

462
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,200
from a personal level I also you like

463
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,150
the travelling I like the balance

464
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,270
between that and so

465
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,100
me home and being at home all the time

466
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,710
is been brilliant and although my wife

467
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,970
said still don't see the kids enough

468
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,290
which is fair enough because I've been

469
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,510
quite busy recently but and I'd like to

470
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,800
do more that next week after this

471
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,370
conference is done but it's been a bit

472
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,620
of a culture shock for me and mainly

473
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,700
that the biggest thing I've noticed

474
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,710
which is being you know quite quite

475
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,300
scary as that officer was in London

476
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,760
right up until the literally the days

477
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,100
before everything shut down and you can

478
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,870
see people still not wearing masks still

479
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,850
not wearing any PPE walking around and

480
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,950
then you come down to where I live

481
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,290
and the sticks the other side of the

482
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,620
country and even yesterday when I went

483
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,910
to supermarkets still no one wearing

484
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,860
gloves or masks or any kind of

485
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,390
protective equipment I'm just walking

486
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,670
around you're thinking because it's not

487
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,380
as prevalent down here maybe it is

488
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,930
London maybe there's a slight worry that

489
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,370
oh we're OK because we're really

490
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,600
promoting there's any bit like three

491
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,920
four hundred cases down here or

492
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,880
something like that in the last few

493
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,210
years and so I think I think the the

494
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,320
psychological effect I've seen affects a

495
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,690
lot of people in the community so look

496
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,280
at like my community you can see a lot

497
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,020
more people under stress and strain I'm

498
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,460
worried and I think there's a undertone

499
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,470
that's Dewhurst mentioned that this is

500
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,720
these are unusual circumstances and I

501
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,220
think you know we just have to kind of

502
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,990
work out okay mentally we have to stay

503
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,490
strong and realize this will pass

504
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,680
eventually and we have to work out how

505
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,330
we can get through it you know to come

506
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,950
out the other side with our mental

507
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,860
health in tax as well yeah and we

508
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,090
obviously will come out of this this

509
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,540
will end it's what the world our

510
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,530
industry looks like when that happens

511
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,630
the we can't be the only company that

512
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,090
I'm the one that I work for where you

513
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,160
know an awesome tech company anyway but

514
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,540
but we fundamentally shifted from being

515
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,940
a global business and offices to fully

516
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,720
remote within ten days and we had a lot

517
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,400
of Tector to cater for that even though

518
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,930
there was a lot of internal work that

519
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,900
went on some great teams but we've we've

520
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,020
proved that we can run a business now

521
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,360
during a crisis remotely and I just

522
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,770
wonder what that's going to mean for the

523
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,140
next stages of not just my company but

524
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,529
but every kind of tech organization or

525
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,370
Internet face and kind of kind of

526
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,809
organizational you'll be interesting to

527
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,230
see I think you just said it then about

528
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,690
how this is almost like the new normal

529
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,370
and I'm really interested to ask I'm

530
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,880
probably the stupidest you host you're

531
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,860
probably given the great example to

532
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,020
start with is this the new normal do we

533
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,360
think post kovaydin all this craziness

534
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,130
rumor at the moment did we actually

535
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,960
think this will be new this is what we

536
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,940
will now do from here on will we just

537
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,650
live at home and and actually can get

538
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,870
rid of rate great big color for office

539
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,659
blocks of you know cost a fortune to run

540
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:23,909
and maybe we see business move to this

541
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:25,980
it's gonna be difficult to argue against

542
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,950
it because we've proven it I mean that's

543
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,740
a bit of a catch-all phrase now finding

544
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,659
it very difficult lots of reasons but

545
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:38,600
fundamentally many will keep going this

546
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,039
ignition changes that's for sure but

547
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,620
then we do have to fetch in those folks

548
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,210
that genuinely like to go to the office

549
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,970
they go to work for social reasons as

550
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,460
well that's I find that's not

551
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,240
necessarily a big factor in our industry

552
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,880
and we probably know why but there are

553
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,029
folk that are gonna want to go back and

554
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,190
so I think we will see change perhaps

555
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,640
not everybody but I did I don't think

556
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,020
we're coming out of this in the same

557
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,080
world as we went into it I think they'll

558
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,820
be a remote working revolution I think

559
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,190
yeah I think this would be the site a

560
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,690
lot a lot of companies and actually if

561
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,159
you look at business continue I had I

562
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,409
caught up I was talking on a podcast few

563
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:21,270
weeks ago about business continuity

564
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,409
planning and stuff like this

565
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:24,720
and about that you know the fact that a

566
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,820
lot of people like actually realizing

567
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,200
that continuity plan wasn't fit for

568
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,270
purpose it was all theory and they

569
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,799
actually put into practice like properly

570
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:37,649
its practice governments yeah we go we

571
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:39,210
got this covered and then like you yeah

572
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,210
we got this no no let's gonna spend lots

573
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,220
of money on stuff that gets wasted but

574
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,190
but like I think that that kind of has

575
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,649
made people realize that you know

576
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:51,870
actually these plans are actually quite

577
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,059
useful and maybe that's a way that they

578
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,159
want to revisit these things but but you

579
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,289
know like we'll see we'll see a lot of

580
00:21:58,289 --> 00:21:59,549
change after this because some

581
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:00,960
organizations who have gone through this

582
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,050
we've actually fared frame

583
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,240
well we'll go well actually that wasn't

584
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,650
much of a headache yes we might have to

585
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,840
respect things for continuous kind of

586
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,400
working this way maybe we'll have a

587
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,620
percent central work first force that

588
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,600
can work as much they want from home and

589
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,980
maybe a percentage that spit their time

590
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,750
a bit more with that flexibility that

591
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,330
comes in mind and then maybe some

592
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,460
organizations may just go to kind of

593
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,930
that hot-desking methodology where

594
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,010
they're just going to have like a hot

595
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,780
desk office where people pop in pop out

596
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,760
when they want and I think that's quite

597
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,920
nice and the some organizations happen

598
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,800
anyway right a lot you know I can be

599
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,610
remote as much as I want and you know

600
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,080
driven by projects make me but if I'm if

601
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,460
I haven't got projects I can choose to

602
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,670
go to work in London or wherever or stay

603
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,950
at home and so you know I think it's

604
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,780
important where where it's flexible to

605
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,670
do that that those those opportunities

606
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,490
are there and I think that's that's

607
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,930
really gonna help things moving forward

608
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,750
I think I mean of course so after you

609
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,880
host E yeah sorry no just adamant which

610
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,320
was asking specifically about the

611
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,550
company I work for but just one thing

612
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,270
every optics in in attack vectors and

613
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,860
things and that's an interesting one as

614
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,450
are organized organisations move from

615
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,690
being less remote to semi remote or even

616
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,820
fully for it for a lot it's difficult to

617
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,140
know just now well I'm sure we're going

618
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,580
to see a few different things I do

619
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,470
expect the big cons when they all come

620
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,880
back online later on the year and I'm

621
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,960
not going to name them because you all

622
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,130
know who they are but the big one that

623
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,900
set Excel is going to be extra back

624
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,320
slappy amazingly huggy and really really

625
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,570
handshake II because we've missed the

626
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,010
physical context of going up to people

627
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,740
got hi how you doing we've missed it and

628
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,110
I really do see it can be extra hooking

629
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,960
extra backslapper this year and just

630
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,030
moving south pics I wanted to ask a

631
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,250
question about what have you now

632
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,310
discovered is a new tool or a new

633
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,900
something that you now are doing that

634
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,580
you've picked up as a result of all this

635
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,800
working from home for me for example

636
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,410
zoom as much as we want to tear this

637
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,170
thing apart actually getting in touch my

638
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,300
family has been so much easier because

639
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,430
of zoom trying to get them to go through

640
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,350
the rigmarole of Skype and all the other

641
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,780
tools out there has been painful I think

642
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,430
understanding the fact that there are

643
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,390
some people out there who aren't

644
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,910
technically able like us to get to use

645
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,550
technology that's been a revolution to

646
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,320
literally click on something within a

647
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,450
minute or so you are now home live

648
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,090
conference call with MoMA dad my mom who

649
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,580
had literally just technically dead I'm

650
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,970
sorry for watching this but just the

651
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,890
ability to do that for me zoom they do

652
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,230
get a plus point for me they really do

653
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,060
what about you pet what about you what

654
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,070
few patient you tools new anything that

655
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,570
you picked up uh for me it's been so

656
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,590
many so I think really for me I'll go

657
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,820
specific me into some other stuff I've

658
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,730
been doing so like a two week is it last

659
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,740
week maybe weekend before first we could

660
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,100
make April some thing I participated in

661
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,220
the trace labs

662
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,860
Osen global CTF right with three other

663
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,080
people from here and we run that three

664
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,100
years in a row past strange flex okay

665
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,470
but uh actually tries to know how do how

666
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,150
we won it three is the right but we did

667
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,700
and for me it's like I with all that

668
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,250
extra time working from home and mixing

669
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,110
in evenings prepping for this and trying

670
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,380
to look at no tools so this means really

671
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,060
good like facial recognition software

672
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,660
that we've used and we kind of really

673
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,430
kind of gelled our processes around how

674
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,930
we did the open source intelligence work

675
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,590
the oceans and really just kind of for

676
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,240
me was about kind of having that time

677
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,650
and flexibility where I'm not traveling

678
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,010
that I can I can do that research and

679
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,780
and really invest more time in it and I

680
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,330
kind of I think for me that that's it's

681
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,460
more rather than tools it's all the time

682
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,230
to research has really benefited me that

683
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,820
I can pick out the tools out one test

684
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,190
them go that works me all testing new

685
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,830
processes or new techniques there's more

686
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,620
techniques and tools actually for me

687
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,910
being into testings I've been thinking

688
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,440
about for ages but never we had the time

689
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,550
because I've been running around like a

690
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,850
blue ass fly or spending 90% of my time

691
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,350
on a train or a plane or something like

692
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,600
that so you've got life but it gets the

693
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,490
way of everything yeah I know it's yeah

694
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,410
just travel I've actually I've worked

695
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,150
out I've got something like because my

696
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,430
travel to work from where I live to get

697
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,960
to London if I'm just going London it's

698
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
about four and a half hours five hours

699
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,730
as altered or one way so ten hours a

700
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,140
week traveling plus a traveling I do

701
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,880
when is a minimum of ten hours a week

702
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,280
right minimum if I don't travel anywhere

703
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,780
else so I don't go to Europe or anything

704
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,059
so

705
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,399
I've got an extra 10 hours that is

706
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,379
almost dead time in the evenings right

707
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:35,149
but I can spend I'll sleep with my

708
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:37,340
family but also doing research like that

709
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,919
so I've used that time that I would have

710
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,070
been spent on a train probably standing

711
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,549
in some cases uh you know actually doing

712
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:47,809
something so that that's been the

713
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:49,669
biggest benefit to me really spot-on

714
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,860
stager what about you tools tips tricks

715
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,590
techniques or only similar to you

716
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,370
actually do and the I was already you

717
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,929
got to remember I was already remote so

718
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:02,119
I was useless but because of the outrage

719
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,309
of what happened to zoom in there

720
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:06,619
perhaps yeah questionable privacy

721
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:09,590
they've been forced to improve and that

722
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,350
has that has helped me a lot and you

723
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,759
know because now I can use it and it's

724
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,200
much more stable so I'm pleased from

725
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,480
that regard also I have a 20 year old

726
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,970
son didn't quite make it out of York

727
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,730
University on the final flight so it's a

728
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,340
it's a god set and to be able to talk to

729
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,470
him face to face it makes a difference

730
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,619
oh you could say oh well you know you're

731
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,179
not together it's not the same well if

732
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:33,799
this is your only option then I would

733
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,139
rather have this option to be honest and

734
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:37,850
and you know it's worked out very well

735
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,919
so I'm very similar to you and and I

736
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,960
would you know I would also agree with

737
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,350
the time aspect you know I work we all

738
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,080
but we're all different we all excel at

739
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,309
different times of the day for example

740
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,350
I'm not necessarily a morning person let

741
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,110
me just be honest about that I'm happy

742
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,779
to talk to America at 10 o'clock at

743
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:59,119
night in Lebanon that's fine by me um

744
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,340
you know and and I feel pretty switched

745
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,980
on then so you know as I say it's it's a

746
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,080
world I'm I'm sort of warming to quite a

747
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,779
lot and and it has had benefit with my

748
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:11,509
son you know as well so yeah big shout

749
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:13,789
touchy son obviously stuck up in York if

750
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:15,409
he's watching this and if he's not why

751
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:15,799
not

752
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,350
and but yeah and I hope is keeping safe

753
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,559
up that firstly what about you you've so

754
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,970
much tech to your fingertips at the

755
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,549
moment more of it flowing towards every

756
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:26,990
minute with vendors to obviously

757
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,519
knocking on your door will come to those

758
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,809
in a minute but what about you what's

759
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,129
what's new in your world that you've

760
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:33,200
really warm to its resources so I

761
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,179
suppose just to echo what you guys said

762
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,409
really I'm not I'm not sure there's

763
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:37,340
anything that's come along that's

764
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,200
particularly new from a tech point of

765
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,290
view yet but

766
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,809
it's more behavioral things and you've

767
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:44,309
touched it like really it's you know

768
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:45,990
I've got family in New Zealand that we

769
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,340
connect with for more than we did since

770
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,490
all this happened Saturday night pub

771
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,960
thing with my mates where I think we

772
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,340
socialize in the ER moment and we have

773
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,900
for a decade or plus and then more for

774
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,710
the kids right so I've got a

775
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,140
three-year-old at home and she does like

776
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,460
a ballet classroom the way they've moved

777
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,400
all of that online within a fortnight

778
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,440
which I know the text fairly simple but

779
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,720
for them to have the foresight and the

780
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,179
pace to do that and keep these things

781
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:13,200
running even if they're just a little

782
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,490
classes for the kids that keep them

783
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,650
interested now that's been the important

784
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,010
thing on a day to day level again I sort

785
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,200
of work similarly during this as I do

786
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,100
normally it's not a straight 95 I'm very

787
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,900
good at taking time out these days for

788
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,910
exercise and I know we can't really go

789
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,669
anywhere but no just trying to fill time

790
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:36,840
with a few other things if you started

791
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,280
doing a lot more exercise now that

792
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,080
you're at home because of you bike now

793
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,070
and you do more excite um it's hard to

794
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,040
find the time anyway I think I'm forcing

795
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,350
myself now because yeah is about the

796
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,540
tough times stress weighs maybe anxiety

797
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,520
why he's like it's always been my my go

798
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,500
to thing mental health anyway a little

799
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,020
bit yeah so I'm definitely forcing

800
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,610
myself where are the days I'm oh just

801
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,740
when I saw they'll just I'll just do

802
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,410
something else yeah I must admit your

803
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,299
postcode vid or were either gonna come

804
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,740
out this is grossly obese or make a fit

805
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,740
site is I mean loads of crap okay and

806
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,330
votes votes who's gonna crack this

807
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,890
heavier than when they started be every

808
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,330
Friday Saturday for the last three weeks

809
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,820
as well not than for three forty years

810
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,080
absolutely

811
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,120
you mentioned put a mental health first

812
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,410
year I'm first obviously kind of mental

813
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,419
is big in our industry to start with and

814
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,220
I know that this is gonna hit quite a

815
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,799
few people hard because they've now

816
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,210
disengaged from their colleagues they

817
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,120
are now only able to remote they may be

818
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,620
working from home on their own which is

819
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,380
you know again it's all bad stuff cos

820
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,990
that would just add into the pile and I

821
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,750
know from my perspective I've met most

822
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,440
maintain positive mental health through

823
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,360
a lot more writing which I found really

824
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,000
comforting today and simply just having

825
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,080
the family around I mean they're all

826
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,370
running around the house that just that

827
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,649
door there I'm glad it's soundproof as

828
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:05,210
it is because they have just legged it

829
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,440
down the stairs I thought swim to

830
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,080
actually perform on stage before and but

831
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,970
I've noticed that I'm probably in a

832
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,289
better place because I have got my

833
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,990
family around me and that's helping me

834
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,419
cope with what we don't know how long

835
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,509
this is going to be I'm any tips tricks

836
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:22,129
from yourselves or how you're coping or

837
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:24,230
what's your coping mechanism you using

838
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,730
and it obviously can no it's kind of a

839
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,409
personal thing is simply not come

840
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:29,000
towards stuff think maybe we've read

841
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,370
that you think's relevant I start with

842
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,620
sticker packs in this one keeper routing

843
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,899
thanks for asking keeper routine is

844
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:37,700
absolutely imperative I know it sounds

845
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,179
silly

846
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:40,789
get up get ready for the day okay even

847
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:42,980
if you're not leaving the house these

848
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,870
psychological routines we are creatures

849
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,059
of routine but we don't realize now if

850
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:49,250
we start to let them slip our minds

851
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,779
start to slip with them we can start

852
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,820
getting down and we don't you know I

853
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,320
don't know why it works I'm not a

854
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,230
psychologist but I'm tried not keeping a

855
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,059
routine and it's very easy to slip into

856
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:02,149
getting down so keep a routine and stick

857
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:02,690
to it

858
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,860
it's fine absolutely Stupak big nod yeah

859
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,769
yeah routine is quite important I can't

860
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:12,350
agree more a mental health perspective

861
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,169
as well it's it's the is the exercise

862
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:18,679
bit so I did like I had some pretty big

863
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,139
projects coming up recently and I knew

864
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:24,500
she was that literally had like project

865
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,220
multi projects at one time and I'd spend

866
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,080
from like 7:00 in the morning until like

867
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,809
10 11 o'clock at night at my office I'd

868
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,730
look up and because he sometimes get in

869
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,049
the zone where I'm just doing something

870
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:38,350
I've forgot I have to eat or drink

871
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,639
sometimes I'll have drink at my office

872
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,289
but I'll forget to drink or eat

873
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:44,210
something and I look at but it's like oh

874
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,710
my god it's like six and evening and

875
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,169
that the day is gone and I'm the

876
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:49,789
exercise and I'll just crack on for a

877
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:51,049
bit and I'll do specs and so the

878
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:52,700
exercise kind of goes way I think it's

879
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,759
the it's the taking the break mental

880
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,529
break you know stepping away and not

881
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:00,350
actually working ridiculous hours

882
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,450
because you can write because you could

883
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,700
do that and you could just literally sit

884
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,049
here switch we're busy and the pressure

885
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,670
of like well you know

886
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,200
everyone's you know under pressure from

887
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,030
a work perspective to try and keep thing

888
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,430
of going so I think that that kind of is

889
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,050
quite important but at the same time

890
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,820
it's the connection issue as well so if

891
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,800
you can have sessions like this or you

892
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,950
can connect people whether that is on or

893
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,320
even as a DM someone on Twitter or some

894
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,180
just a Creek zoomkour voice chat and

895
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,620
discourse it's like that you've still

896
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,150
got back human connection especially for

897
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,400
remotes so if you're without family and

898
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,960
you'll stuck out somewhere and you're

899
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,060
stuck by yourself this this is quite

900
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,490
powering time and a lot of the if you're

901
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,020
just embodied by the negative news

902
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,310
stories that you're hearing every day

903
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,290
that is going to get you down that is

904
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,910
going to have a mental effect so reach

905
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,520
out to people on Twitter or reach out or

906
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,080
you're struggling say I'm struggling and

907
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,180
people will help I think that's what's

908
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,380
good about our community because we will

909
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,970
understand InfoSec can be quite

910
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,770
challenging normally ANCA quite

911
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,460
stressful normally so being able to go

912
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,200
and say hey I'm struggling or I'm not

913
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,460
having a good time and knowing people

914
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,420
are there is quite a nice thought so I

915
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,070
think yeah if you see someone struggling

916
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,179
as well and you think they're struggling

917
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,070
and then a bit often don't you know

918
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,630
don't hesitate to reach out to them and

919
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,239
DM them and say how today going also say

920
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,370
I think all four of us at DMS open up we

921
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,409
fir yeah seem to remember we've seen it

922
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,149
and in those two you hosted me belong to

923
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:21,739
you I know you've really been a big

924
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,320
advocate of this and then oh yeah your

925
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,449
physical exercise has been a really big

926
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,449
help for your mental health yeah keeping

927
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:29,690
going

928
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,540
yeah so I've talked a lot over the last

929
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,310
maybe 18 months about mental health and

930
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,739
well-being and and we not a few webinars

931
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,139
and various things but I want to caveat

932
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,940
it with I don't actually feel that I've

933
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,739
had too much in the way of struggles

934
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,719
with mental health but what I have been

935
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,668
has been in reasonably stressful

936
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,760
environment as Jake's just diluted to in

937
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,918
the jobs that we've had I've had friends

938
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,540
go through some really bad stuff we sort

939
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,949
of see their learning curves and the

940
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:57,440
things that they've used and then you

941
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,580
have your good days and bad days like

942
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,860
like any human being but what it is is a

943
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,780
topic that sort of fascinates me about

944
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,840
how individuals get through certain

945
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,040
things and how they're able to use

946
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,060
different mechanisms we did am a mental

947
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,570
health

948
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,640
panel at the digit Expo in Edinburgh at

949
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,600
the end of last year and it was just

950
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,000
phenomenal we had a professor from

951
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,850
Glasgow uni we had a HR rep who was

952
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,740
mental health first aider and then a

953
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,380
couple of people from industry and there

954
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,000
was some great advice and some great

955
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,670
chat about the triggers and you know how

956
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,260
things can escalate and then some of the

957
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,860
ways to make it make it easier and we

958
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,240
had some really interesting content and

959
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,980
it was different for each person so it

960
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,790
wasn't as if there was a

961
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,370
one-size-fits-all thing we had Rory

962
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,440
Alsop who runs beside Scotland and

963
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,050
really active in the community talking

964
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,430
about the fact he loves to keep busy you

965
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,230
know his mechanism is working a lot

966
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,820
actually it's not yet down time it's not

967
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,480
the holidaying whatever he loves his

968
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,160
work and that's what takes him you know

969
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,990
into this happy place and for the rest

970
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,700
of us it's either exercise or being

971
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,440
family or combination of different

972
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,420
things for me I've always trained I've

973
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,490
always done exercise I'm getting old and

974
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,290
slow these days but it's always been my

975
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,690
go-to thing to take my brain somewhere

976
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,250
else and I always feel better afterwards

977
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,440
so difficult to stop doing that when

978
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,300
you've got it's an addiction really of

979
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,050
its own

980
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,510
okay so old and slow just said it in a

981
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,670
race out of us for I would put you at

982
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,400
the front okay just say you're the only

983
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,760
one show on a bicycle right yeah so I'm

984
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,590
gonna switch tone a bit and let's have a

985
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,660
bit of fun with this so we've all been

986
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,240
stuck inside and the big 43 inch plasma

987
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,550
in the corn has been beckoning what have

988
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,230
you been watching the either a you've

989
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,390
regretted starting watching on wire did

990
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,580
I get into the series I want to stop it

991

now or have you watched and think you

992
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,810
thought TV film whatever it is and you

993
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,370
thought that's actually really fairly

994
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,640
decent I don't got any TV film

995
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,320
recommendations or things to avoid

996
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,720
that's all that I mean for me I'm only

997
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,740
half way through it so don't give away

998
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,010
the ending that tiger thing on Netflix

999
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:05,330
yeah bonkers yeah yeah that's fun on my

1000
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,620
to-do list I'm in the middle of

1001
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,060
something at the moment which I couldn't

1002
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,440

1003
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,530

1004

00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,780
which I thoroughly know I have no idea

1006
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,940
why I'm started to up started to really

1007
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,670
enjoy watching foreign films with

1008
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,580
British subtitles no idea why but yeah

1009
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,950
I've done a lot of that this season yeah

1010
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,690
chapeau so decent that's the earliest

1011
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,740
fairly these no points that really laid

1012
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,970
Pecha cord yeah so so I been watching

1013
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,340
yeah it's been mainly Peppa Pig you know

1014
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,530
I thought I thought all the kids into a

1015
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,450
lot of the Ghibli studio stuff so I've

1016
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,670
been watching spirited away and I've

1017
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,980
been watching Howl's Moving Castle and

1018
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:55,790
um princess in okay and and all that all

1019
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,080
them that's all in that fix and I

1020
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,880
thought oh my god the kids kids love it

1021
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,130
I love these comes or maybe fits with no

1022
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,290
case a little bit like violent right

1023
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,610
beginning when some arrows shoot some

1024
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,619
arms the head off but you scrape over

1025
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:09,950
those bits right there okay right and

1026
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,250
and like the rest of its okay but you

1027
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,810
know even though it says it's a PG in

1028
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,760
Atlantis to be fine and you realize okay

1029
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,560
maybe that's a PG from ten years ago and

1030
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,670
so my kids have been getting a lot of

1031
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,110
older films as well so forgetting to

1032
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,080
like drastic happens to fight this

1033
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,940
classic grassy park which is again

1034
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,950
actually as PG and it's actually quite a

1035
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,650
quotes in places but yeah but I learned

1036
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,150
for me personally I've been watching The

1037
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,680
Witcher and stuff like this and also

1038
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,220
targeting actually and I won't ruin it

1039
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,230
for anyone but but a lot the stutter one

1040
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,690
of the people that may have disappeared

1041
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,369
as part of that and the investigation

1042
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:45,020
was going into was actually include as

1043
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,480
part of our CTF that for trace labs they

1044
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,250
got thing that present included although

1045
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,200
I don't think anything got found without

1046
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,740
giving the hard way so yeah very much

1047
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,980
like the case but yeah so yeah so that

1048
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,480
the talking's actually open an optimist

1049
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,460
imagination iced chai brief I can't I

1050
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,130
I find it really like I gotta say I find

1051
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,950
it really interesting just the level of

1052
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,260
like how it escalates and just the

1053
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,330
airplane and I just said I'm such as

1054
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,480
laughing just ridiculous it's the whole

1055
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,670
thing but yeah so things like that I'm

1056
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,130
going the classic reasons like this I

1057
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,530
love my anime so we had to show my kids

1058
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,320
some but a kind of cool anime stuff

1059
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,030
that's going on and then more recently

1060
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,670
I've been getting into the alter carbon

1061
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,290
stuff again so I rewatched season wanted

1062
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,550
to of that because I love those shows

1063
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,680
new season just after doesn't just

1064
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,730
started yeah we alter carbon - yes been

1065
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,630
around for a little bit it's been out

1066
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,850
for a few weeks but yes that's kiss the

1067
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,400
first one but yes III not been been

1068
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,050
watching too much but I always watch the

1069
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,450
thing for a go to bed and so

1070
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,980
I usually fall asleep to it but yeah

1071
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,200
that's kind of I think such a thing

1072
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,570
gancho see after you I was just gonna

1073
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,970
mention something else that I have a bit

1074
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,350
of space geek so I watch a whole load of

1075
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,560
stuff to do with the Apollo missions and

1076
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,060
things and there's Apollo 11 I think

1077
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,970
it's on Netflix or Amazon and it's a

1078
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,320
documentary but there's no narration

1079
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,150
over the top of it it's all in the

1080
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,160
timeline a bit happening with lots of

1081
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,130
unseen footage and I'm heard Houston

1082
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,450
control stuff and it's just fascinating

1083
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,600
to watch I mean everybody knows the

1084
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,990
ending like but did they get if you but

1085
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,450
if you believe it you don't report in

1086
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,230
full hot Sun I would definitely say we

1087
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,880
mean the missus decided that we're gonna

1088
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,140
start in sheesh I kissed some of the

1089
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,700
proper old classic so we start with

1090
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,340
Flash Gordon proper Flash Gordon on DVD

1091
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,590
it's a genuine version can I just say

1092
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,870
the most inappropriate movie I have ever

1093
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,640
watched with the child oh yes there were

1094
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,880
so many fast forwards it was most our

1095
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,680
memories of these older things

1096
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,540
definitely don't stack up to PG nowadays

1097
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,800
to have these tablets will help you

1098
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,250
forget your wedding night

1099
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,380
[Laughter]

1100
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,760
there's no sputters has to appropriate

1101
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,070
scenes and I watched the mask the mask

1102
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,710
right Jim carries a mask right yeah oh

1103
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,270
my god that's so either it's

1104
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,540
inappropriate and like so like like soft

1105
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,220
hiss sticks today as well it's like

1106
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,420
really bad

1107
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,150
it's a SIA I watched it when this film

1108
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,760
would never get made today I only spend

1109
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,600
every one is so I think we forget that I

1110
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,940
think become desensitized when you watch

1111
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,770
those from eighties films right yeah

1112
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,970
very violent and incredibly

1113
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,650
inappropriate right and then nineties

1114
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,390
films push that a little bit further

1115
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,130
with the inappropriateness but less

1116
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,990
violent in some cases yeah then today

1117
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,270
it's I it's like people outcry when they

1118
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,490
see like depictions of women in certain

1119
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,840
appropriate ways and you're thinking

1120
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,970
yeah look at the nineties films like

1121
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,460
this like to be out crying everywhere

1122
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,360
and I think we forget the you know times

1123
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,980
have changed so much in a good way and I

1124
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,020
think this is a great thing

1125
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,300
yeah I agree most of our 80s TV

1126
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:59,870
presenters are in jail there's a lot a

1127
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,740
hole in history

1128
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,220
pretty much

1129
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,619
yeah yeah the other thing that we start

1130
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:05,030
doing is we try to do a better culture

1131
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,349
with the case and watch that Andrew

1132
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:08,180
Lloyd Webber they're doing live stage

1133
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,130
productions that they you know put him

1134
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,050
back on on a Friday night on YouTube and

1135
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,450
the first one we watch was Jesus Christ

1136
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,040
Superstar think he was no it wasn't it

1137
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,200
was the other one yeah Joe Stevens

1138
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,599
Technicolor Dreamcoat le character

1139
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,670
minute I recognize him from somewhere

1140
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,460
and it was a camera his name is that his

1141
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,930
perfect white teeth in a straight line

1142
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,570
next minute it cuts to a scene it's got

1143
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,640
Joan Collins in a fishnet body stocking

1144
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,150
you up whoa whoa whoa we stop this right

1145
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,480
now

1146
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,580
last night we were another Friday we

1147
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,520
watched a place if anyone's in the chat

1148
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,210
and saw it

1149
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,940
I'd recommend go back and watch it if

1150
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,710
you've got a small kid don't let them

1151
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,140
watch it it was fun to me the Opera and

1152
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,160
it was fantastic

1153
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,020
apart from my eight-year-old has now

1154
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,400
been sleeping in our bed for two nights

1155
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,810
because she's having nightmares about

1156
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,390
the guy with masks covering her together

1157
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,040
and the guy hanging his neck for three

1158
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,550
minutes not good for kids but but now

1159
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,619
I've got to say our we're now trying to

1160
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:05,030
stop the kids from just sit and watching

1161
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,920
telly all day then we actually try not

1162
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,940
to move unites in stuff and that's

1163
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,619
worked out quite well but this comes

1164
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,060
soon good stuff spirited ways actually

1165
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,400
on our to-do list of wants to watch yeah

1166
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,990
I noticed some people a chap gave a

1167
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,760
really big shout out for that one so

1168
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,760
yeah so well done good good mr. robots

1169
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,140
come up a lot in the chat I noticed as

1170
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,690
well I have to see some three went and

1171
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,599
get blood of this now yeah season four

1172
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,790
season four got like the likely season

1173
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,230
got a lot better actually cuz I almost

1174
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,460
gave up in it and I thought I'll give

1175
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,960
the last season a go at you yeah really

1176
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,550
good at the end so I think it's worth

1177
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,109
persevering through the first season

1178
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:38,660
always be the best right but yeah you

1179
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,000
got better I think this I think that

1180
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,140
this is the thing we're quite spoiled

1181
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,510
with our TV no I think yeah no I

1182
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,910
remember when there was China five came

1183
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,070
on and ah that was amazing another

1184
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,500
channel oh my god oh you're five

1185
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,880
channels now guys I remember what it

1186
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,339
started as been quite young but I think

1187
00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:58,280
you are this is amazing five channels we

1188
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,810
forget like you know we grew up on my TV

1189
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:06,430
was like your choice was nothing right

1190
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,570
today it's too much and I think that's

1191
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,490
another bring us back to InfoSec right

1192
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,230
and it's this kind of brings you back to

1193
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,390
like where we are today that if

1194
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,059
when most of us started out and there

1195
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:18,650
was nothing right you'd want to go learn

1196
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,180
about InfoSec hashtag gay old okay uh

1197
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,650
yeah you'd learn something about it and

1198
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,839
you'd have to go to four and then people

1199
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:28,519
would get keep the knowledge and you

1200
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:29,930
have to push really hard to find stuff

1201
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:33,650
and a BBS or you know IRC kind of stuff

1202
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:34,940
you'd have to really push hard to find

1203
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,440
anything on all this stuff it was what

1204
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,630
kind of like it kept a secret kind of

1205
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,819
treasure how to unlock right I had to

1206
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:42,019
prove yourself that you actually knew

1207
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:44,779
something and and now if you fast

1208
00:44:44,779 --> 00:44:46,819
forward to now it's you know it's all

1209
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:49,190
out there get up you get up early repose

1210
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,730
and do you think um I see a lot of the

1211
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,170
big conferences are being cancelled too

1212
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,539
this summer but and there's been no

1213
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:58,490
online stuff anyway do you feel that the

1214
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,869
industry is going to move more towards

1215
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:02,569
catering for a lot of that anyway and

1216
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:05,000
because I know Amazon and big names you

1217
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,039
know to tend to do online at the same

1218
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:08,779
time but but this kind of thing with a

1219
00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:10,579
few hundred people with some really good

1220
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:13,039
content you know there's a hell of a lot

1221
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,450
less anyway but it could be awesome if

1222
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,819
we could them you know we've talked

1223
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:17,750
about the meetups a week that we're

1224
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,480
under to open them up to the world

1225
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,799
rather than just a little country that

1226
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:23,660
we live in just has such a massive

1227
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,869
impact I think the DC cons will do

1228
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:28,309
phenomenally out of this because all of

1229
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,500
a sudden if I can make a DC con if

1230
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,589
you've now got this it's an alternative

1231
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:35,809
form I think we superb I'd love to go to

1232
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:38,660
some of the other DC comes around me you

1233
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,670
know DC one for one can just you know

1234
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,309
that just you never get to them and if

1235
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:45,230
it is in this format will be able to get

1236
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,430
to them and actually be able to go and

1237
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,769
see other cons as well which I think we

1238
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:52,130
were fairly cool but yeah I don't think

1239
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,990
the big stuff like the info sexing and

1240
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,750
stuff I'll and I don't think those all

1241
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,839
happen I think that it will stay I think

1242
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,670
the big ones are still still stay is

1243
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,500
that like that but I think smaller con

1244
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,819
same people in my list I'm not saying

1245
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:06,769
b-sides be good like this though I think

1246
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,329
be sad to be a bit more tricky to do

1247
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:10,549
like this but I think this this would be

1248
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:17,569
good okay yeah okay well I'm bit biased

1249
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:19,759
because of virtual conference right so

1250
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:21,859
yeah yeah once you go virtual well maybe

1251
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:22,970
that one should go first shall we should

1252
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:26,299
keep doing it um yeah yeah so there's a

1253
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:27,980
dearth con reach

1254
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,400
out to me last last week and they want

1255
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,630
to promote they want to put our condom

1256
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:35,090
back at their t-shirts like this because

1257
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,800
they are like another virtual con that's

1258
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,660
not many of them out there now they're

1259
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,980
kind of won't be starting it there was

1260
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,740
like though it's like pancakes calm and

1261
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,910
there was a couple others right there

1262
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:47,650
Grimm Koenig on virtual and so I think I

1263
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,730
think that's an appreciation the

1264
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,280
conference this war will say well do we

1265
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,550
really need a venue do we read do we I'm

1266
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,470
a big I'm a big believer that certain

1267
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:58,880
conferences should have been you right

1268
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,970
so DEFCON blackhat that kind of stuff

1269
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,280
right germ factories right where fluke

1270
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,109
on a food can't actually make something

1271
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:10,090
right colorful emedicine think sorry I

1272
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,130
and and I think it's important to get a

1273
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,380
mass group of people together face space

1274
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,660
that's a big special about that I think

1275
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,180
we shouldn't move away from it because

1276
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,920
they you know you create memories and

1277
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,920
your crate experiences and and you make

1278
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,420
friendships right from people that you

1279
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,520
talk to online and I think that's always

1280
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,109
going to be there and I think we

1281
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:31,820
shouldn't take that away but but what

1282
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,310
this does what the virtual conferences i

1283
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,660
found i mean bear in mind we spent

1284
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,430
nothing right we spent okay we spend a

1285
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:38,180
little bit but not much

1286
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,950
right putting this together so we've

1287
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,510
we've just put our resources or

1288
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,480
expertise we've used platforms so that

1289
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,910
the cost of doing this is literally very

1290
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,640
very little right and and we've managed

1291
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,960
to raise money and we've got people

1292
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,310
donating stuff because we're doing it

1293
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,750
for free and we're doing it for a good

1294
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,000
cause right so why can't more people do

1295
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,680
that if you've got the right people and

1296
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,260
you've got right technical expertise why

1297
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,840
can't you put your own calm and i think

1298
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,359
i think that reduces the barrier to

1299
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,770
entry because when we tried to put on

1300
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,280
the first con that we tried to do um we

1301
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,650
were looking at like 30 grand plus for

1302
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,590
the venue like far show expensive right

1303
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,119
and so we looked at it and went actually

1304
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,410
that venue then went out of business so

1305
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:21,070
we actually dodged a massive bullet so

1306
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,840
we would have been an absolute disaster

1307
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,390
so actually in hindsight pretty good

1308
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,359
thing but and so you know i think a lot

1309
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,530
of venues gonna have to start thinking

1310
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,480
about you know well this this could be

1311
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,670
impact their business but but for anyone

1312
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,920
out there wants to do this just do it i

1313
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,720
mean what you know i think you know if

1314
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,950
you've got an idea and it's slightly

1315
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,119
different i mean there was the one oh a

1316
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:41,990
siscon yester

1317
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:44,359
right in virtual reality whole

1318
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:46,220
conference a virtual reality speaker

1319
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,589
staged their slides on and everyone in

1320
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:50,480
sight you know that VR kind of like you

1321
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,410
know people I pop my French I love that

1322
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,210
I'll say the first person to f-bomb on

1323
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,119
here and we're in conference so they go

1324
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:01,900
oh just put myself in the swear jar

1325
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,020
right back please Maurice to what we'll

1326
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,280
put that will put the professional on

1327
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,750
Indus lead amateur here right like I

1328
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,190
thought that's such a great idea and I

1329
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,930
think that that could be why things go

1330
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,359
so you know I think that that actually

1331
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,820
worked really well so to answer your

1332
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,109
question without taking up too much time

1333
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:23,780
I think we'll see a lot more virtual

1334
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,700
cons now and I think there'll be a good

1335
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,260
balance between people having virtual

1336
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,050
Consulate's professionally done and then

1337
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,820
the standard cons will still go on

1338
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,320
because I have to write because there

1339
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,170
are DNA of this industry yeah i

1340
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,690
massively I mean I'm a conference goes

1341
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,700
as most people know me from is I'm

1342
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,730
always at the cons and I actually think

1343
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,890
this will help but I do want to start

1344
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,690
from a physical conferences there's

1345
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,760
still something about how the tactile

1346
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,710
environment of a conference you know

1347
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,390
getting flow off you mate is always a

1348
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,300
part of every conference season but I'm

1349
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,339
fascinated by the VR confident superb

1350
00:49:58,339 --> 00:50:00,589
what a great useful fear I've always

1351
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:03,349
looked for a use for VR VR for me has

1352
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:04,880
been something it's just a technology

1353
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,430
needs to be implemented somehow and I've

1354
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,460
never seen it curtisha that virtual VR

1355
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,330
conference what a way for that be Stuart

1356
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,940
I mean you course and you probably know

1357
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,859
me the best and the truth the matter is

1358
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:20,990
is that I'm in real life I'm very shy

1359
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:24,320
and you know to a certain degree I don't

1360
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,790
like to admit it but socially awkward

1361
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,310
and this is ideal for me look at me I've

1362
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,740
gone from the person that my wife calls

1363
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,140
me a Wallflower it sort of blends into

1364
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,089
the come somewhere and can't be saying

1365
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:36,589
to the person that's out the front

1366
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:38,270
because I do have something to say and

1367
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,540
so you can see the flip side as well and

1368
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,420
we just me down to the ground and I I

1369
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,190
suspect there's more people like me I

1370
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,950
don't gone the only one so I think this

1371
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,080
is gonna this is gonna open up for a new

1372
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,960
set of people to come and be comfortable

1373
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,700
in these environments

1374
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,579
I hope so I hope so anything okay is so

1375
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:01,070
fantastic message that really is so

1376
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,800
we've got five minutes left so I think

1377
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,910
we should point your closing comments

1378
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,680
because I've got a slide to show to

1379
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,579
people so what's your what's your guess

1380
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:11,690
Stu because you've asked all the

1381
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,010
questions I'm going to ask the question

1382
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,410
then go back into podcast my Stuart

1383
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:15,859

what's been your biggest takeaway from

1385
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,780
this whole experience from this cutter

1386
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,960
from this citation can yeah you can of

1387
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,450
these we need to most you common fees we

1388
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,740

across the desk and in the office or

1393
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,869
even if it's just having a chat with

1394
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,130
someone online

1395
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,200
I do miss those moments so this has been

1396
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,869
brilliant really loved it more of this

1397
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:49,880
please definitely stick up next month

1398
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,640
yeah more the same more of a saying the

1399
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,500
the more the better unless you're a

1400
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,150
person there yeah absolutely

1401
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,599
she Hearst yeah I mean look at what's

1402
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,369
happening right there this is I know

1403
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:03,410
it's an overused word and in what we're

1404
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,390
going through but unprecedented we're

1405
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,880
having to fix problems globally we've

1406
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,760
never faced before at all sorts of

1407
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,589
levels tech you know right through to

1408
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:15,079
mental health well-being family and all

1409
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:16,730
that we're doing here all that we're

1410
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,589
putting together for our industry and

1411
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:20,150
the people who work with us it's

1412
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,349
phenomenal

1413
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:23,060
when always gonna get it right there's

1414
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,069
gonna be some tough days and I think

1415
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:26,750
we'll look back on this generally with

1416
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,670
pride about how we've we've conducted

1417
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,109
ourselves and the things that we've put

1418
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:30,980
together and the things that we've

1419
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,400
contributed as individuals and as groups

1420
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,839
so I'm a fairly positive person anyway

1421
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,760
right will come through the end of this

1422
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,290
and more will look back they'll be

1423
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,180
learnings and our industry or kind of

1424
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,300
grow from it rather than because of it

1425
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,380
yeah so we're down 50 percent you target

1426
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:52,430
5856 Wow thank you everyone I think I

1427
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,819
wish I have more of these yeah

1428
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:57,829
iiiiii yeah that's amazing thank you

1429
00:52:57,829 --> 00:53:00,099
reform is just donated and I'm sure

1430
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:04,000
identified one knows but but basically I

1431
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,980
decided and the guys decided that every

1432
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,630
time someone donates

1433
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,700
the staff and the moderators are going

1434
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,770
to post a meme of me on Twitter with

1435
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,140
taking that person donates in so there's

1436
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,460
been quite a few memes of me going right

1437
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,140
and by the way there's a massive massive

1438
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,680
like the back load of them so as Paul

1439
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,030
memes that I can count and there's more

1440
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:24,890
being created just in case we run out so

1441
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:27,950
oh that's so good so yeah I mean it's

1442
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:30,380
all for a good cause right so it's not

1443
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,000
like I don't mind being beans because it

1444
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,460
happens every day so yeah I think I

1445
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,380
think to kind of summarize this before I

1446
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,210
kind of focus off I think you know this

1447
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,890
dis dis to me is kind of made you

1448
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,170
realize that the best of people and it

1449
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,550
also brings out the worst in people the

1450
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,810
cyber criminals and all this kind of

1451
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,030
stuff right and like the the Chinese

1452
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,840
like I think they say the two words the

1453
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,220
kind of crisis and one of them is

1454
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,110
opportunity or whether it's danger

1455
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:55,880
there's opportunity basically right and

1456
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,620
I think there's always an opportunity

1457
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,630
for people to do good but it's also a

1458
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,100
massive opportunity for people to do bad

1459
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,990
and I think we've got to realize is and

1460
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,750
this is a big shout-out to the CV 19

1461
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,570
people so the Lisa down dank dank Arden

1462
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:09,650
all that kind of stuff for doing the

1463
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,570
work there they've taken an opportunity

1464
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,310
to help protect those assets where

1465
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,350
people would likely do that and I think

1466
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,820
this has brought out loads of great

1467
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,640
things the community and I think that's

1468
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,160
what makes us great the community that

1469
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,860
we will identify things for me yeah I'm

1470
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,930
also helping a little bit as well but

1471
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,880
but you know putting on a conference and

1472
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,010
try and raise money for a charity that

1473
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,810
is also doing good is one way of doing

1474
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,970
it other ways to actually help protect

1475
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:37,340
the assets from you know the NHS and

1476
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,750
things like this and healthcare from

1477
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,160
being a talented as well which which is

1478
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,810
which which is is happening in some

1479
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:44,090
countries as well so yeah I think we

1480
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,890
will have to kind of pull together and

1481
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:47,000
we all have to roll our sleeves up and

1482
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,730
do what we can in our work and also

1483
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,080
we're in the community we have to pull

1484
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,600
it on our sleeves up as well so I think

1485
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,950
