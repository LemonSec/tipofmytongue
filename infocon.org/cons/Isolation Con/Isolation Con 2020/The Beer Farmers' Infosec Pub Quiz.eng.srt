toilet uh well

342
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,560
questionable oh yeah hey my favorite

343
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,279
stuff

344
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,160
what ics malware was used in the natanz

345
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,959
bush air attacks

346
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,880

car car spelled your chance wrong yeah i

350
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,199
thought it was yeah

351
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,440
quite correct it was of course stuxnet

352
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,360
which is my favorite subject

353
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
let's change things oh they'll change

354
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,760

off to be fair what's good here is

363
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,399
though i think

364
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,160
we get like a top five so these are the

365
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,519
winners of the prizes right

366
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,560
all good yeah you got this come on

367

i mean i'll win my own book back right i

368
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
used to write this stuff so what was the

369
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
native logic software that was modified

370
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
by the ics malware

371
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,320
in the stuxnet attack well this was in

372
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,279
rio rodacte's talk

373
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,680

374
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,199
simatic s

375
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,279
i got it right i'm in number one step

376
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,199
seven was the uh the logic software that

377
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:45,920
was

378
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,040
modified by the malware

379
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,639
good stuff let's see what happens there

380
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,720
we go oh no

381
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,480
i didn't know i made the podium

382
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,639
cracking on at the time how many windows

383
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,720
zero days did this malware package use

384
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,760
to infect systems

385
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,920
one billion they're not 13.

386
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,199
none of them are on the board or are

387
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,439
they

388
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,519
i think that's wrong

389
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
you can take that up offline with us

confirmed it is a total of four zero

395
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:32,639
days

396
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,279
ah [ __ ] on your bike son

397
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,720

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,920
so what specifically got done as a

402
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,680
result of infecting the plcs

403
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,839
what devices were compromised

404
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,440
oh the attack system exploded

405
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,519
that's entirely true moving on

406
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,920
oh there's a little flames symbol next

407
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,639

just spread the screen then couldn't i

411
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,320
okay what was the nsa subgroup thought

412
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,920
to be behind it or collaboratively

413
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,399
behind it

414
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,199
why don't you ever come up with cool

415
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,680
names because it's the nac

416

691
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,360
in the quiz that are just actually

692
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,320
having a laugh

693
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,679

715
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,919
to defcon many many times

716
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,320
when was the first one do the maths here

717
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,039
needed um

718
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,200
that one yeah yeah

719
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,640
of course uh um so who

720
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,960
who was that the first def con anybody

721
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,679
just i wasn't

722
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,559
i wasn't no it's in the room in the

723
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,919
twitch if you

724
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,799
if you're kicking around in the twitch i

725
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,520
was at school

726
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,960
so technically i was

727
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,120
yeah it was it was technically 93 that's

728
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,640
why i was like that's wrong

729
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,679
but well yeah i was inaugurated

730
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,120
yeah but the first the first event which

731
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,039
makes me feel incredibly old i know

732
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,960
everyone's like i wasn't even born

733
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,520
i wasn't born someone got that that's

734
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,640
good

735
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,039
of course right what is the best thing

736
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,960
to add to a hash

737
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,399
um chips cheese

738
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,639
sometimes obviously

739
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,840
salt and pepper a little bit of tobacco

740
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,559
um i think you'll be speaking to john

741
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,159
about um that egg

742
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,240
sausage cheese i think the best thing to

743
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,640
add to hash is some tinfoil and a zippo

744
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,399
but actually it's actually technically

745
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,980
it's bath salts apparently

746
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,679
[Laughter]

747
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,279
there's my john mcafee talk the bath

748
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,760
salts i haven't quite used them yet i

749
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,519
haven't quite got around anyway

750
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,279
don't remember don't forget the recipe

751
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,360
for excellent bath salts if you take

752
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,279
four milligrams

753
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,440
nothing happens if you take six

754
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,760
milligrams you eat someone's face off

755
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,200
yeah and in between you have a really

756
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,519
weird if you take five milligrams

757
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,000
you're humping a whale yeah or you're

758
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,279
having your

759
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,039
dong sucks off at a bank or something

760
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,399

761
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,279
brilliant

762
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,480
inappropriate thing i've ever heard in

763
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
the talk absolutely but the yeah the

764
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,000
best thing to add to a hash at the very

765
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,039
least there's a salt

766
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,320
and even better a pepper so all good

767
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,679
next let's see what happened nothing

768
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,440

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,280
satellite networks

841
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,280
no idea we probably need to increase the

842
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,480
timings on this shouldn't we

843
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,400
for too long for twitch stream sorry

844
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
guys doesn't matter we're disregarding

845
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
zuma and zephyr for winning anyway

846
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
so it's fine i'm consistently getting

847
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,960
questions wrong anyways it doesn't make

848
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,200
any difference

849
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,359
even even with a five second head start

850
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,119
like i'm still [ __ ] this

851
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,400
i'm just wondering whether it might be

852
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
easier if i um

853
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,720
read out the questions before pressing

854
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,520

855
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,280
um comment that the the answers are

858
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,320
[ __ ] coming up before they get the

859
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,160
chance to actually hear the question

860
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,640
which sounds like madness to me mikey

861
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,960

862
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,760

868
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,440

869
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,280
the next question still got it wrong and

870
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,320
i'm still in second place

871

i'll press the button and then you can

873
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,359
do your answering the question is

874
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,920
troubling trabach is a town on the

875
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,320
moselle river in western germany

876
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,560
and was home for a very nasty hosting

877
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,680
company called

878
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:27,839
what here it comes

879
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,640
go daddy

880
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,839
only for you

881
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,960
um it was cyberbunker and cyberbunker

882
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,480
was interesting one because it

883
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,160
fell foul of spam house i don't know if

884
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,760
you remember the the history of this but

885
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,680
spam house basically blacklisted all of

886
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,040
their ip ranges

887
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,560
and it pissed them off the cyberbunker

888
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,480
then launched a huge dos attack

889
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
on spam house and all got looked very

890
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,520
messy and

891
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,720
i guess people got upset

892
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,839
drama clock was reset many times indeed

893
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,640
yeah right let's look at scores and then

894
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,760
we'll go to the next question we're

895
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,800
nearly doing anything

896
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,720
rest in peace infoget drama clock as

897
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000

898
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,800
physical

899
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,480

i think we need it back the obvious

904
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,680

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,880
another one

917
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,200
yeah good one now okay

918
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,040
combining ransomware with blackmail and

919
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,720
we're seeing a lot of that happening

920
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,079
extortion data extortion yeah there's

921
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,480
there's a lot of discussion about that

922
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,079
in some of the covered cti

923
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,520
communities right now yeah yeah

924
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,680
all right let's have a look scores on

925
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,640
the doors

926
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
i think zoom has got this in the bag but

927
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,800
we'll see there is time yet

928
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,040
all right the joint special operations

929
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,760
command aka jsoc

930
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,000
um has a unit tasked with signals

931
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,480
intercepts and surveillance operations

932
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,400
what is the task force designation of

933
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,160
this unit

934
00:38:50,160 --> 00:39:01,839
to look after steve

935
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,240
oh this is this one

936
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,040
i think well it's got to be um yeah i

937
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,520
think

938
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,880
yes see i didn't get that one no that's

939
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,160
cross orange

940
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,760
and the correct answer is also beer

941
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,880
farmers gold which i kind of like

942
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,359
nice little touch everything feels like

943
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,280
it's falling into place

944
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,760
and ian will be sad that he missed this

945
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,480
uh well

946
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,920
can we say close to a little shout out

947
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,200
for ian for putting this together it's

948
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,000
awesome

949
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,960
absolutely you'll be pleased that it

950
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,240
went as well as it did because

951
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,920
i must admit i was panicking about it

952
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,200
and thinking how the hell are we gonna

953
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,160
do this

954
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,760
but it's working fine it's working

955
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,480
brilliantly right so next and this is

956
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,839
the final round so

957
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,359
i don't know if you want to get yt

958
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,119
cracker primed up but we're on the pitch

959
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:47,839
around

960
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,280
so obviously i'm not going to be able to

961
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,119
read things out here it's we're going to

962
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,320
have to wing it

963
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,560
so it'll be like we've had previously

964
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,839
the questions will come up you'll get

965
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:56,560
the answers

966
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,799

right so good luck everyone and uh let's

970
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,839
see how we finish up

971
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,680
what is the name of my ship

972
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,240
oh that's a great one love that

973
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,839
oh [ __ ] you're supposed to look at the

974
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,200
picture yeah that's hard i mean it works

975
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,960
that didn't even try yes that's that's

976
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,240
generally how picture rounds work

977
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,079
well i tried guys i tried

978
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,640
yeah that was a good one serenity uh

979
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,319
well done if you got that one right

980
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,119
um actually the there seems to be a lot

981
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,400
more time on that as well i don't know

982
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,839
how that works but it seems to last a

983
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,119
little bit longer so hopefully more

984
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,400
people were able to actually

985
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,040
see it and answer it okay

986
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,960
very little done to change the top of

987
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,160
the table

988
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,440
he's such a nerd seemer

989
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,680
i didn't have a point change yeah nearly

990
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,880
that to be fair

991
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,040
next i mean we were discounted from this

992
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,000
anyways what

993
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,040
is this device

994
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
oh god wait what i've not seen one of

995
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
those in years

996
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,680
that is old that's before my generation

997
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,280
i mean a lot of things are before your

998
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,800
generation though

999
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,520
that's true but that's not the point of

1000
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,920
a baby

1001
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,319
see i got that right and that's older

1002
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,920
than me well done

1003
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,839
