um so just a quick i'm going to kind of

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,240
take you through

78
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
what i call joining the dots to cyber

79
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,919
security so let's let's draw the picture

80
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,360
to the unicorn and see what we can

81
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,479
achieve

82
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,840
uh firstly who am i uh

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,400
so i'm a defender hence i suppose blue

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,039
team

85
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,759
for many many many many many years in uk

86
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,320
government

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,400
the tax man of all people so positively

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,479
despised by everyone

89
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
then a consultant and then a vendor so

90
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,560
defender turned vendor and now

91
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,160
unemployed so i'm not trying to sell you

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,919
anything so don't worry on that front

93
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,520
uh won a bunch of awards which is really

94
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
nice uh generally just know a bunch of

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
people

96
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
like the subject matter like drinking

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
get along with people

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,759
and i've just got a few bits of my

99
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,759
experience to spare with you and

100
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,479
just see where we get to and if there's

101
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,680
anything to learn from that

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
um so basically kind of say what you see

103
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,520
um there's

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,000
there's a common problem that i see in

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,199
cyber security

106
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,319
and the industry today um something

107
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,120
that that holds many organizations back

108
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,400
in their maturity their ability to grow

109
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,880
learn and develop into a more effective

110
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,319
organization

111
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,840
certainly when it comes to defense and i

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,160
talk about defense as um

113
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
everything kind of on the internal side

114
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,199
so i'm not just talking about analysts

115
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,560
in a sock and things like that that's

116
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
you know blue team for me goes

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,280
way beyond that it's the whole

118
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
organization and everything they do

119
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,639
the whole culture and every piece that

120
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,639
sits with it um

121
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,360
there are many many more than a singular

122
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
problem to tackle but for me there's a

123
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
pivotal piece

124
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
that i'm going to focus on in particular

125
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,080
that that really

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,440
drives i think a wedge or a blocker or

127
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,880
is a real hamper

128
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,240
um to preventing stopping people

129
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
realizing their potential when it comes

130
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,840
to blue team or comes to security

131
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,759
securing the organization

132
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,199
and it goes way beyond just being able

133
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,800
to say kind of we take your security

134
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
seriously this is about actually doing

135
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,039
it

136
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,479
um quite simply for me too many

137
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,400
organizations and this is you know from

138
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,240
having been there and done it and also

139
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
spoken to my peer groups and i'm sure

140
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
most of us would actually if

141
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
we looked in the mirror heartily would

142
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,720
own up to it as well

143
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,520
um treat our initiatives our solutions

144
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
our activities in isolation

145
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,599
and by that what i mean is that we don't

146
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,000
really give true cognizance we don't

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
understand or we choose to ignore the

148
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,880
linkage between

149
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,599
each initiative and the overall goals

150
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,599
another pathway is to defining and

151
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,280
achieving that goal

152
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
so what i mean there is kind of we've

153
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
got dislocated security teams

154
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,599
running dislocated initiatives and

155
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,199
wonder why we're not progressing at the

156
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,639
pace that we should

157
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,240
uh within that as well it's kind of when

158
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,080
we look at our initiatives when we look

159
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,759
at our activities we're not

160
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,639
always conversant or understanding all

161
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
the different pieces of the puzzle that

162
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
make an effective outcome

163
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,039
you might disagree um you might not

164
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
think this is something you do

165
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,720
however if we just take it at a base

166
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,440
level and run

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,199
through what i think is a very

168
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,440
straightforward example

169
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
and we'll see where people sit so let's

170
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,199
start with security education and

171
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,400
awareness

172
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
this is something that was a bug bearer

173
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
of mine when i was at hmrc

174
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,879
it's something that i went and did as a

175
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,479
vendor as well and i want to speak about

176
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,160
that from from an example of why

177
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,560
i think as an industry generally it's an

178
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
example of how we don't see the dots we

179
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
don't join the dots together

180
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,479
and how we can use it to start to build

181
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,120
out this

182
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
theme and this changing mentality to

183
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,039
actually understand greater what we need

184
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,240
to do to achieve

185
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,039
um greater outcomes and greater goals so

186
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,400
awareness how many people

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,840
have a requirement to run a security

188
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,679
awareness program uh that'll be

189
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,039
absolutely everyone they might include

190
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
phishing simulations they might do

191
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,679
once a year 30 minutes of death by

192
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,360
powerpoint because they need to tick the

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
pci dss box

194
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
whatever it happens to be it's a

195
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,040
requirement for everyone um

196
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,519
however when we or when many of those

197
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,200
run through the process of defining the

198
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
overall goal

199
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
and the various links and dependencies

200
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,519
to make that happen do they actually run

201
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,480
through that

202
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
um far too often i hear security experts

203
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,080
or organizations when they're talking

204
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,560
about

205
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
awareness that their overall goal is to

206
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,000
raise awareness

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
and awareness in their organization or

208
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
maybe measure preparedness

209
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,959
and when neither really has any meaning

210
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,040
in terms of an actual goal

211
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,320
so awareness is not a goal

212
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
awareness in itself gets you little

213
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,959
unless you understand the linkage and

214
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,080
i'm just going to digress slightly um

215
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,519
because for me it feels like as an

216
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,480
industry itself that we're actually it's

217
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,160
designed to push us into a siloed

218
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
mentality

219
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
it's designed to push us into taking

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
things in isolation and not seeing the

221
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,560
bigger picture

222
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,040
whether it's crowds waves or insights

223
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,000
it's all looking at isolated components

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
and at no point you actually see where's

225
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,519
the join where's the linkage where's the

226
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,600
cognizance of people and process

227
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,839
where's the dependencies where's the

228
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,440
aspects that are outside

229
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,399
of our locus of control every technology

230
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,160
in the world is absolutely useless

231
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
unless you have people in process

232
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,640
to feed water it keep it up to date to

233
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,399
effectively use it to its fullest

234
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,320
capability and get beyond using just

235
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
five percent of what we paid for

236
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,560
and actually making the best use of it

237
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
so let's just go back to awareness while

238
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
we're thinking this and thinking of

239
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
quadrants and silos

240
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
um let's take a trip into the approach

241
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,880
of the adversary

242
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,480
um so the adversary that we're looking

243
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,160
at here let's take it as a simple that

244
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,200
we're going to look at those who use

245
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,640
phishing emails whatever it happens to

246
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,120
be

247
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,600
um quite often we say you need to think

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,560
in the

249
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,200
mind think like an adversary um in this

250
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,959
case it works purely to prove a point

251
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,040
um so how preposterous do you think it

252
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
would be

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,120
if adversaries worked in the way that we

254
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,800
do when it comes to security

255
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,959
um with siloed initiatives that seldom

256
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,200
join up um there'd be a lot less of a

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,839
threat

258
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,560
that's for sure um but think about it so

259
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
would an adversary look up

260
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
slightly less evil gartner for the

261
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
latest insight into what they should do

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
what initiative is in the top right

263
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
what's a leader um would they send

264
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,959
phishing emails

265
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,200
and then maybe realize a year or two

266
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
later that an exploit included with the

267
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,560
phishing email would take them to the

268
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,320
next level of maturity

269
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
alternatively would there be a tad more

270
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,160
joined up than that in pinning stages or

271
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,839
initiative to an overall strategic

272
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,440
outcome and goal

273
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,800
now so you think about adversaries

274
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
adversaries are mission oriented

275
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,440
um so so should we be so long as we can

276
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,519
define the actual desired outcome rather

277
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,440
than some near-sighted siloed goals so

278
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,120
awareness isn't the goal that we want to

279
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,640
achieve

280
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,880
um so would an adversary only send a

281
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,640
phishing email without ever considering

282
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,440
what happens

283
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
next well no it'd frankly be utterly

284
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,079
ridiculous to

285
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,240
to even come up with that concept yet

286
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,079
think how we of defenders approach our

287
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,839
controls our initiatives

288
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,720
so are we as joined up as the adversary

289
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,320
are we joined up at all

290
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
and and and if we're not joined up why

291
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,120
not

292
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,519
so i'm not just thinking about kind of

293
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,880
the analyst angle when it comes to

294
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,160
obviously your gardeners your forest as

295
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
you whoever i don't really care

296
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,519
um but also think about the different

297
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,200
touch points that the industry offers to

298
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,480
us whether it's conferences and the

299
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,519
majority of speakers our expert insights

300
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:07,920
uh

301
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,399
various webinar series and how much is

302
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
driven by a singular viewpoint and a

303
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,200
mentality

304
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,480
you know that there's this super

305
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,079
sophisticated emerging threat

306
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,839
vulnerability adversary whatever it

307
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
happens to be and i just happen to

308
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
offer the very cyber widget that combats

309
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,360
it

310
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,959
i'm not going to sell it directly to you

311
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,560
in any of these things but i'm going to

312
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,240
skirt around it so that you know my

313
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
technology's the one to buy

314
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,920
and it is basically a technology and

315
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
sales focused or rather siloed focused

316
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,800
approach

317
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,519
um thought leadership or really is it

318
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,560
sales thought

319
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
and i don't in any way blame sales

320
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,760
people for trying to sell

321
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
but i do blame an industry that places

322
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,519
that at the top

323
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,240
um where money is more important than

324
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
the actual security and the

325
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,720
and the achievable or the goals that we

326
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,079
want to actually get to

327
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
and there's nothing new or ever likely

328
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
to change in that but it's just got to

329
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,079
be recognized as to why we kind of have

330
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
this mentality in the way we approach

331
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,920
what we do

332
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,440
which all leads us kind of into this

333
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,120
silo or the funnel to ensure that the

334
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,639
focus is on the product

335
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,800
the solution the silo itself

336
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,000
but we've done that for years we've done

337
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,279
it for years and years and years and

338
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,560
years and years and a focus on

339
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
technology and a focus on siloed

340
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
initiatives and a focus on things like

341
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,800
doing awareness

342
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,160
because awareness is a thing that we

343
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,959
have to do and it's not really got us

344
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,079
anywhere

345
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,079
i don't know about you but for me it

346
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,160
doesn't feel like the world of security

347
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,440
is particularly in a better place than

348
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,000
it was say

349
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,800
10 years ago or 20 years ago we're still

350
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
carrying a massive massive legacy we're

351
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
still carrying an incredible debt we've

352
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,560
still got controls that we have no idea

353
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,079
whether they work or not are effective

354
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,600
we're still poor at risk management

355
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
we still look to the simple things the

356
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,800
things we're driven to which is

357
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,680
solid initiatives technology specifics

358
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
rather than actually looking at how we

359
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
address things across the whole

360
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,360
and understand how almost the domino

361
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
effect of activities actually work

362
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
together to achieve an outcome and if

363
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
you remove one of the dominoes then

364
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
you're likely to fail halfway

365
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,199
because what we're doing is we're

366
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,320
missing the web and i don't mean the

367
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,839
internet i'm talking about the web of

368
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,519
interconnectivity that runs throughout

369
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,000
everything we do and want to achieve so

370
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,440
one of the biggest changes i think we

371
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
can make as an industry or as a

372
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,959
discipline is to really alter how we

373
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,079
approach

374
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,800
the things and recognize linkage and

375
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
realize that everything we do is linked

376
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
and focus upon effectively one junction

377
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
on a spider's web that leads down

378
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,880
different pathways

379
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,760
so nothing itself is isolated there's

380
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,040
always knock-on effects there's always

381
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,240
dependencies there's always people

382
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
there's processes there's teams as goals

383
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,079
and of course there's gaps

384
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,760
and the more we recognize how things

385
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,240
bleed into each other

386
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,399
the more we'll actually design actions

387
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,160
with links in mind

388
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
and it'll enable us to affect better

389
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,399
change rather than masking a problem

390
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,880
or moving it a long one or ticking a box

391
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,040
it will also build a greater cognizance

392
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,800
of the things around our little world

393
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,560
that impact our effectiveness

394
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,760
things that we don't directly control

395
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,839
but can influence if we understand them

396
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,120
better

397
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
so kind of with that little tangential

398
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,160
run on to the side as to why i think we

399
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,839
think in a particular way

400
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
i want to come back to that little issue

401
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,839
of awareness where we started kind of

402
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,639
right off the

403
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
off the bat

404
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
so you raise awareness that's your goal

405
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,519
you've set that

406
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,120
a standard and you do it through

407
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
whatever mechanisms you do as we said

408
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,800
maybe once a year mandatory

409
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,399
security awareness training that sits

410
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,399
along your side your health and safety

411
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,079
and all the other bits that i have to do

412
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,920
to tick boxes or you do it properly you

413
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
know you use every mechanism possible to

414
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,680
get a touch point with your users to

415
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,320
drive

416
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,079
an awareness campaign that's predicated

417
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,000
on personal cyber security using every

418
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
mechanism possible

419
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,720
to build an aware workforce fab

420
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,320
absolutely great um you might even kind

421
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,720
of

422
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,800
use those mechanisms and and perpetually

423
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
continue to to drive kind of goals and

424
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,680
champions and

425
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
and every possible way that drives that

426
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,079
that awareness and go beyond kind of

427
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,160
bloody pci dss that said you had to run

428
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,600
it at least once a year and everyone

429
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,120
took that as a bare minimum did just

430
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,720
that

431
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
but that awareness what does it actually

432
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,399
get you so your business colleagues are

433
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,880
cyber aware

434
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,000
which means what exactly if you set a

435
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,680
goal of awareness and you want your

436
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,880
people to be aware

437
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,440
they are now aware and what

438
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,959
so maybe in one aspect they're more

439
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,279
likely to spot a phishing email

440
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,800
what we do and do what

441
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
do what with it what have you trained

442
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,880
them to do in terms of that awareness

443
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
you taught them to delete it in which

444
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
case you've taught them that

445
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,880
essentially they're masters of their own

446
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,120
risk and risk for the organization and

447
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,720
everything will happen at the user layer

448
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,839
and you from a risk management

449
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,079
perspective will be blissfully unaware

450
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,079
but you can see even just a very simple

451
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,640
step there that awareness kind of leads

452
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,799
into the necessity to undertake an

453
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,760
action

454
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,199
and let's not pretend awareness is going

455
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,480
to hit 100 of the people 100 of the time

456
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,599
and they'll always make the right

457
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,919
decisions along the way but even there

458
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
let's just kind of think about that so

459
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,319
let's factor in the fact that the

460
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
majority of email-borne threats

461
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,480
because it's a nice easy example to go

462
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,520
through um

463
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,799
are generic they're mass distributed

464
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,360
which generally means that in all

465
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,840
likelihood

466
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
you're going to have more than one

467
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
recipient in your organization

468
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,080
so let's say for example there are 10

469
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,760
you've got 10 recipients of a particular

470
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,160
email threat email born threat that are

471
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,360
in your organization

472
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,520
that's landed in the inbox super it's

473
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,960
got past the controls because things

474
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,120
always will that's just the way it is

475
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,960
deal with it so now these 10 people

476
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,039
all need to make the same positive

477
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
decision to delete the suspicious email

478
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,360
for your awareness to have had a success

479
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,799
for you to have actually achieved a

480
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,320
successful outcome when it really

481
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,919
matters which is when the actual

482
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,720
potential threat

483
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
lands in the inbox or it manifests

484
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
itself to that end user

485
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
and how confident are you that all 10 of

486
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,919
them are going to make the same decision

487
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,799
and actually enact that decision and

488
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,240
therefore achieve that success

489
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,640
so then even if we look at that from

490
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,360
there

491
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,640
we also have to acknowledge that this

492
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,720
happens to happen every single time

493
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,880
so even then as i said the security team

494
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,120
the risk team are blissfully unaware

495
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
as our risk management regime that this

496
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,480
is all done at the user level

497
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,320
it's still done at the inbox level it

498
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
never actually

499
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
flies at all in front of anyone that

500
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,240
needs to assess it from a risk this is a

501
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,440
risk potentially

502
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,840
manifesting up until the point of

503
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,240
potential impact or exploit within the

504
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
organization itself or being dealt with

505
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,760
and therefore one of your controls the

506
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,679
human and awareness actually working

507
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,760
and your risk management is blissfully

508
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,280
unaware that that happened and therefore

509
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,080
you don't know

510
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,440
to measure the effectiveness of that

511
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,280
control

512
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,880
so of course what if the user was to

513
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
report the suspicious email

514
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,240
would that be better well yeah of course

515
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
it would um but then from that awareness

516
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,679
of course we need to understand that

517
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
that user then needs to report it

518
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,760
um they need to then understand how to

519
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,440
report it

520
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
then maybe we could take an action

521
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
before some of the nine remaining

522
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,640
recipients have to make their decision

523
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,679
which sounds great

524
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,360
absolutely sounds great it sounds like

525
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,160
the type of thing that we should do

526
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,679
but as i said firstly we need to think

527
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,919
about how are they going to report it

528
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,520
and to whom

529
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,080
um will your analysts need to talk your

530
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,840
end users through the mechanisms of

531
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,360
forwarding the suspicious email as an

532
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,919
attachment so they can investigate it

533
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,480
and believe me it's something that has

534
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,000
to happen

535
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,120
and believe me it is easier said than

536
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,240
done

537
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
even just the simple thing of phoning up

538
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,679
a user and saying you're from security

539
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,200
you can almost feel

540
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,280
the clench the tension in the air before

541
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,880
you even start to have a conversation

542
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
about what's needed

543
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,039
and so so that user wants to report it

544
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,320
and we need to get a copy of the

545
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,039
attachments

546
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,080
so how will we find out if there are any

547
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
other recipients

548
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
do you have access to the mail server

549
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,960
there's a really simple one

550
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
or is that run by another team outside

551
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,360
of security maybe even a supplier

552
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,039
and do you have processes in place to

553
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,679
engage and prioritize their work

554
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,559
so without even trying and at the very

555
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,880
basic start of this journey

556
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,640
we've gone from awareness being an

557
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
initiative being a goal to already

558
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
leading outside of security and to

559
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
dependencies and processes with other

560
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,559
teams

561
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,840
other teams will have competing

562
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,280
priorities because funnily enough the

563
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,039
exchange team's primary focus

564
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,520
isn't security it's generally keeping

565
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,200
exchange from falling over

566
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,960
making sure it's kept up to date making

567
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
sure it's working well and making sure

568
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,559
any changes are put through in line with

569
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,120
change management

570
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,640
but now think about this for every

571
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,520
single step of the investigation

572
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
and the overhead as well that you've

573
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,120
just placed onto your security

574
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,559
operations

575
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,720
by moving the awareness action just from

576
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,360
delete to report

577
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,679
now of course reporting is far better

578
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,720
than deleted

579
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,039
you know but it comes with a cost it

580
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,640
comes with a significant overhead

581
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,600
moreover this is just the investigation

582
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,799
this is just firstly

583
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,720
reporting which understand that every

584
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,000
time you report something you've

585
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,679
generated work for another team within

586
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,000
your organization

587
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,440
but you also need to take meaningful

588
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,200
mitigating action otherwise

589
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,799
what's the point you may as well go back

590
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,480
to the user just deleting and hope that

591
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,200
that works every time

592
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
so simple thing can you purge a

593
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,159
suspicious email from all mailboxes

594
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,840
does it require email administration

595
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
team is that a supplier again does it

596
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,240
involve

597
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,480
change control believe me in some places

598
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,159
it actually does which sounds bonkers

599
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:58,799
because it's

600
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,640
a response in a sense to a potential

601
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,400
threat but in some places contracts have

602
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
written that you need a change control

603
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,960
in place um do you have authority or

604
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,880
security to actually do it and how

605
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
quickly can it be done

606
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
and can it be undone if you've made a

607
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,919
mistake

608
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,000
and again without even thinking and

609
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
without actually going into any depths

610
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,480
here

611
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,600
whatsoever we've already

612
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,400
got links from awareness into security

613
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,520
operations

614
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,240
into i.t operations and possibly other

615
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,200
processes

616
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,039
things like itel as i say from change

617
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,039
management you'll certainly have service

618
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,480
management in there

619
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,880
you'll need pre-ordained authority

620
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,760
without even

621
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,919
thinking now we're straight away

622
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,600
bleeding from one discipline into

623
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,320
another

624
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
when all we wanted to do was raise

625
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,559
awareness but to actually be effective

626
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,240
in what we want to do of having our

627
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,000
people aware making them able to spot

628
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
things that are potential threats that

629
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,520
might manifest even as simple as just in

630
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,000
the inbox

631
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,559
just focusing on that alone we need them

632
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,159
for those users to be able to report it

633
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,080
we need them to know who to report it to

634
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,159
we need an easy mechanism for them to do

635
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:02,480
it

636
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,679
we need them to report it to the

637
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,440
security people who need to be aware

638
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,039
that this overhead and be

639
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,640
ready for this overhead that's going to

640
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,400
come their way they will need to

641
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,159
undertake an investigation that will

642
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,080
potentially involve different data sets

643
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,280
different technologies

644
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,679
and potentially different teams and then

645
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,360
off the back of that make a decision and

646
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,799
enact something

647
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,520
as a result of it and straight away one

648
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,200
simple bit of awareness about a phishing

649
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,159
email has gone

650
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,400
right across an organization into all

651
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,000
sorts of different areas

652
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,559
but if we do that then we're starting to

653
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,480
look at a successful outcome

654
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
that maybe if we report things one will

655
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,480
be more aware from a risk perspective

656
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,600
because something has got through our

657
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,159
controls and landed in the inbox

658
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,840
we'll be able maybe to actually get

659
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,360
there before those other users need to

660
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,320
make a decision

661
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,000
and we can show the effectiveness of our

662
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,520
process controls

663
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,120
that actually our response is

664
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,919
potentially quicker than our users

665
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,200
but of course there's always a danger

666
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,480
because there's plenty of dwell time in

667
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
there that our users are going to be

668
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,720
quicker than us

669
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,919
and hopefully they'll make the right

670
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,360
decision and report it as well but

671
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,400
generally means that

672
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,840
you've got two tickets for the same

673
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,200
thing and you'll have to investigate

674
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,640
those

675
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,200
but without thinking as i said you've

676
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
already started to build a spider's web

677
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,159
just by looking at what happens next

678
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,840
so saying so what what happens when one

679
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,080
of these things occurs and what would we

680
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,039
like it to what would we what do we want

681
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,799
it to look like when it comes to making

682
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,559
successful interventions across the

683
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,520
organization

684
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,360
so that we can actually have a

685
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,200
meaningful impact when it comes to risk

686
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,159
reduction

687
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,679
and response to threats

688
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,520
so that overhead already is quite a cost

689
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,039
and it's the cost you pay for your

690
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,880
security operations team

691
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,039
um for your security operations team now

692
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,880
working more hand in hand with your

693
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,080
awareness team

694
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,720
now if you do security awareness and you

695
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,640
don't involve your security operations

696
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
team

697
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,720
then you really should how are you going

698
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,240
to make them aware of the latest threats

699
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,919
that really could manifest if your

700
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,679
security operations team are not working

701
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,120
with you to help you understand what

702
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,360
threats may manifest to those users

703
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,760
or what actions to take how to drive

704
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,919
those actions how to enact them how to

705
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:10,720
do something

706
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,640
which is bound to involve the operations

707
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,480
team how do i get in touch with them how

708
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,120
do i

709
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,039
log calls with them how simple is it be

710
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,960
how do i start to engage on a human

711
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
level between these different teams

712
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
how do i get my security teams to work

713
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,080
together which

714
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,000
you know it may seem ridiculous that two

715
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,159
security teams don't work together but

716
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,039
it's really really common it's

717
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,039
ridiculously common to see awareness and

718
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,919
operations

719
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,760
not work hand in hand it sounds bonkers

720
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
it sounds like one of the most obvious

721
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,200
things going

722
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,240
but it happens all the time

723
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
and sometimes you've just got to break

724
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,039
through those barriers and make it

725
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,480
happen yourself to make sure that

726
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,919
actually if you're in awareness and you

727
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,279
don't work with operations

728
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
go and meet them go and investigate go

729
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,360
and join with them just to understand

730
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
what type of stuff you can let your

731
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,159
users know about and vice versa

732
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,440
but then when we look at that that

733
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,279
investigative process of what we might

734
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,400
need to go through

735
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
um we can then look at it and kind of

736
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,320
see that that in terms of that once that

737
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,120
user hits

738
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,279
you know that that report action and it

739
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,880
comes to security to

740
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,279
operations to do something meaningful we

741
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,880
can then look at all the different steps

742
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,720
they have to go through to understand

743
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
well what is it they need to do to

744
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,159
undertake an investigation

745
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,320
and then take a meaningful action and

746
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,760
undertake potential

747
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,640
you know different actions depending on

748
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,240
how this threat potentially manifests

749
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,840
and the actions of the user at the other

750
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
end which may swirl down into different

751
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,200
parts of the spiders web

752
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,320
and then start to see how effective are

753
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,360
those pieces

754
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,720
you know you'll get phishing emails

755
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
you'll get rogue emails malicious emails

756
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,840
spam whatever it happens to be that's

757
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,039
reported to you

758
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,279
how good are you at actually enacting

759
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,039
that investigation how good are you at

760
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,200
making meaningful decisions how good are

761
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,279
you at getting the facts really quickly

762
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,520
and then how good are you at taking the

763
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,279
action the remedial action to protect

764
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,039
the organization

765
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,720
and of course are there pieces in there

766
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
that you can make slicker

767
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
is there a process aspect in there that

768
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,000
you can make slicker

769
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
is it possible to automate some of it is

770
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,840
it possible to use some kind of rules to

771
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
to help you understand some of that can

772
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
you use some of the native apis

773
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,320
available to you like

774
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
you know 365 there's the native search

775
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
api can you make use of this to make

776
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,640
some of the investigation better for you

777
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,600
and and yes you can frankly you know for

778
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,039
something like an email born threat

779
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,240
there are some obvious

780
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,159
tasks that any investigation will

781
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,440
complete

782
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,919
first of which you need a copy of it um

783
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,320
you certainly want the headers

784
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,159
you want any attachments and understand

785
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,000
those you want any links and understand

786
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,120
where they're going if you want to

787
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,799
discover if there's any other recipients

788
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,200
or any variants because let's face it

789
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,240
things like sender subject and that are

790
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,600
going to change

791
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,080
um do you need a human analyst to

792
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
undertake some of these acts

793
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,840
do you want things like the sender ip

794
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,200
address and do you want to do

795
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,039
reputation lookups on it do you want to

796
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,120
do who is information from those

797
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,039
registrars that understand the gdpr a

798
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,159
little bit better than others and we'll

799
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,440
actually give you information back

800
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,360
how much of that can you actually use

801
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
technology or aspire to use technology

802
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,039
to ensure that your dwell time gets

803
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,399
reduced as you undertake these

804
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,679
investigations

805
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,679
because you've added a greater overhead

806
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,919
to your security operations by making

807
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,679
your users more aware and asking them to

808
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,360
report things

809
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,200
and you see already then we're starting

810
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,520
to look at process optimization maybe

811
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,360
automation we'll hang on and maybe we've

812
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,960
got a strategy about automation

813
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,679
somewhere

814
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,279
um but what maybe we can't do today we

815
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,520
could aspire to use technology to do

816
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,799
tomorrow for repeatable tasks so when it

817
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,080
comes to things like the links or when

818
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,919
it comes to attachments as i say the ip

819
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,080
address lookups any spamless checks any

820
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,159
debark checks simple things that maybe

821
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,679
we can actually just do

822
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,000
in an automated fashion so that when

823
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,760
that user spots something because

824
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,440
they're far more aware they undertake

825
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,720
the reporting action

826
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,559
that as they undertake that report in

827
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,320
action or very soon after we start to

828
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,840
present the analyst with as much

829
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,679
information as possible to help the

830
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,279
investigation and get us closer to

831
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,399
decision making

832
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,720
and remediation as quickly as possible

833
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,399
and look at those and see can we make

834
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,080
those slicker as well and how can we

835
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,559
make it better

836
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,480
there's quite a lot in an investigation

837
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,320
such as this you could potentially use

838
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,840
technology to reduce the analyst

839
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,919
overhead so you can present them with

840
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,039
those results

841
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,640
and the decision-making but it does

842
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,360
require thought and it requires effort

843
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,399
and it requires collaboration and that

844
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,080
maybe you can see though how we can

845
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,840
maybe mitigate some of the overhead that

846
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,640
we've placed

847
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,200
because of awareness by just moving it

848
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,960
from move from delete to report

849
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,480
and how much more of a meaningful

850
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,039
outcome we can create if we start to

851
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:41,600
follow

852
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
all the different actions all the way

853
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,720
through the

854
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,000
now what the user reports it now what

855
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,240
operations have to get hold of it now

856
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,320
what they need to investigate it

857
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,799
now what they need to remediate now what

858
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,640
and all the different pieces

859
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,720
that make up those those puzzles and

860
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,760
those actions

861
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,200
because they'll all have sub-actions

862
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,279
within there

863
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,600
and you'll see that we break from

864
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,559
awareness

865
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,360
awareness being a goal which it isn't

866
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,520
and start to bleed into awareness and

867
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,960
operations

868
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,000
and process and people and relationships

869
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,919
and suppliers and other teams and then

870
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,760
potentially where

871
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,399
we can optimize aspects within that and

872
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:22,880
all

873
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,760
fit within the same flow which allows us

874
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
to look at a more goal-orientated

875
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,880
structure that

876
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,799
the awareness when it comes to say

877
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,240
phishing emails

878
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,559
has this long horizontal trail that

879
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,399
leads to a potentially successful

880
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,600
outcome

881
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,440
and that's where we need to start to

882
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,039
move our minds to

883
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,039
to start to make far more effective

884
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,240
decisions

885
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,840
across what we do as security

886
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,760
so when we think about kind of uh

887
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,039
remediation

888
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,760
um what we're on about there is is is

889
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
what we want to develop confidence

890
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,559
levels when we talk about things like

891
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,640
automation we want to have confidence

892
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,559
that this task is repeatable and make it

893
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,039
better

894
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,399
uh and i'm not talking about machine

895
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,080
learning again i said i'm not a vendor

896
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
anymore i'm unemployed so i'm not trying

897
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
to sell you anything um

898
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,480
but when i talk about things like

899
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,000
automation i mean an ability to

900
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,720
accelerate

901
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,039
something to to get results get to the

902
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,279
next action as quickly as possible

903
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,519
but in a way that actually you have

904
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,039
confidence it's the right thing and

905
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,120
presents you with the right

906
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,720
outcome to then take that forward and

907
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,640
make the next one

908
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,799
um and while we're at it there if you

909
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,320
think about it

910
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,519
is there anything else we can do with

911
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,960
the stiffness of information that our

912
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,080
investigation has covered

913
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,159
so we could obviously send bad urls to

914
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,919
firewalls and web gateways and

915
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,000
scene tools to see if anyone's clicked

916
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,440
on them or prevent anyone from making

917
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
any further access so long as actually

918
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,039
you've got the authority to make those

919
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,039
changes and put blocks in space

920
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,080
um we can send the sender ip address to

921
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,760
the email gateways and say no more from

922
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,120
that sender ip address please because

923
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,279
it's obviously delivering bad stuff to

924
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:53,519
us

925
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,279
whilst at least we investigate in case

926
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,360
there's another wave of the campaign

927
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,960
um and we're starting to get there into

928
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,600
more active controls usage and again we

929
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,120
need to consider things like item we

930
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,200
need to consider

931
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,480
pre-authorization our it operations

932
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,080
friends believe me you only need to

933
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,919
break a live service once for it to

934
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,279
really hamper your ability to make

935
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,720
change a second time

936
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,760
um and where are we requiring that we're

937
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,440
acquiring interactions potentially with

938
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,279
other teams so do you have the ability

939
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,720
to make changes to firewalls web

940
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,399
gateways where proxies are exactly our

941
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,000
good old friends in networks who we

942
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,720
blame for

943
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,240
literally everything that could possibly

944
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,919
go wrong um

945
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,679
and and do we need them now to join the

946
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,679
investigation party do we need

947
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,200
them to join kind of the incident

948
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,120
response party now you might have this

949
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,600
already

950
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,279
trained you might have mechanisms to

951
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,200
engage with them but do you also

952
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
understand when they've got competing

953
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,360
priorities so example if there is a

954
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,440
live service incident and there is a

955
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,960
security incident which one's going to

956
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,000
take precedence because

957
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,679
can you actually enact your security

958
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,360
response if there's a live service

959
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,080
incident at the same time what we're

960
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,799
talking about

961
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,240
essentially there is automation and

962
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,799
orchestration in one sense or another

963
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,240
um so whether people are trying to sell

964
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,919
you saw um

965
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,120
or whatever it happens to be or you've

966
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,039
got a strategic initiative about that if

967
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,399
you actually start to think about what

968
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,480
is it i want to automate and why

969
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,559
and why might i want to orchestrate

970
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,080
things and how could that make a

971
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,840
material impact that links all the way

972
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
back to something at the start

973
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,039
all of a sudden we've got a far more

974
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,799
coherent case for

975
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,039
proving the ability proving the need to

976
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,200
automate proving the need to orchestrate

977
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,000
and linking it back to an initial um to

978
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,240
an

979
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,000
initiative that then has a successful

980
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,600
outcome that saw

981
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,120
in some form that doesn't have to be a

982
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
vendor capability that can be you doing

983
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,640
some form of automation

984
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,279
and you using it to basically produce

985
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,039
requests to make changes

986
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,399
um that you can do that and start to

987
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,080
prove that initiative

988
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,399
and make it more impactful and more

989
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,200
effective in the way that you approach

990
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,640
potential threats and risks that can

991
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,120
manifest in your organization

992
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,559
so we can go from awareness being a goal

993
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,039
to

994
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,240
actually awareness leading into us being

995
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,279
able to look at process

996
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,600
automation and process optimization and

997
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,279
potentially orchestration and build a

998
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,199
business case for how that could be

999
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,280
a beneficial way to reduce overhead and

1000
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,800
reduce risk and make us far more

1001
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,599
effective

1002
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,280
with kind of proven risk metrics

1003
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,719
and when we look at that as well is that

1004
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,800
a lot of the information there

1005
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,639
excuse me a lot of the information there

1006
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,679
that we've picked up from the

1007
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,520
investigation you could also deem us as

1008
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,280
snippets ifc's if you want to

1009
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,960
uh of potential threat intelligence that

1010
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,480
we could then share with partners

1011
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,000
and we can be a producer of threat

1012
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,599
intelligence which i'm sure threat

1013
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,960
intelligence is on our list of

1014
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,560
strategies of something we want to do at

1015
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,440
some point

1016
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,760
um and already then we complete from

1017
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,960
awareness into

1018
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,320
process optimization into operations i.t

1019
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,040
land i.t operations itil and potentially

1020
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
into future strategic builds of security

1021
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,760
automation

1022
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,280
and orchestration and also threat

1023
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,199
intelligence as a producer not just a

1024
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,560
consumer

1025
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,639
and we can start to build out this wider

1026
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,640
wider spider's web from all of a sudden

1027
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,079
all we wanted to do was protect the

1028
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,160
organisation from phishing emails

1029
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,680
but actually we're starting to build

1030
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,359
coherent

1031
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,200
business cases coherent strategies

1032
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,680
coherent plans for how our maturity can

1033
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,040
build and build and build

1034
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,200
and get us further and further forward

1035
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,560
in what we want to achieve

1036
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,720
and then we can think about well we

1037
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,920
could actually start to think about

1038
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,839
metrics in this space as well so what's

1039
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,200
the relationship between

1040
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,800
people reporting versus um our security

1041
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,320
team getting there first and actually

1042
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,200
finding things

1043
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,599
in people's mailboxes when we become

1044
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,200
aware of a threat from the amazing

1045
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,960
threat intelligence that we pick up

1046
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,640
um or we just read the things like

1047
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,920
dynamic blog and get something really

1048
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,119
useful and actually use that every

1049
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,560
morning to try and find something within

1050
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,240
people's inboxes

1051
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
so are people able to report before we

1052
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,920
spot them can we spot them before the

1053
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,880
users

1054
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,720
but also then what time does it take us

1055
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,240
to run the investigation what time does

1056
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,119
it take us

1057
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,920
to remediate well of course if our users

1058
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,280
are reporting really quickly then it

1059
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,119
takes us an absolute age to do what we

1060
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,560
need to do because the overhead on the

1061
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,079
security team is too great

1062
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,520
you start building a business case for

1063
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,040
more people or you start building the

1064
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,680
case for

1065
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,599
process optimization to reduce the

1066
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,599
overhead you start being able to measure

1067
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,119
meaningful metrics when it comes to

1068
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,960
preparedness our preparedness isn't how

1069
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,839
many phishing

1070
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,920
simulations did we click on this week

1071
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,680
it's whether actually

1072
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,839
can we deal with things when it really

1073
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,920
matters can we proactively go and find

1074
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,440
things in users in boxes

1075
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,040
based on threat intelligence can we

1076
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,359
react to our users reporting things to

1077
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,480
our security teams

1078
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,960
and the lead in an effective and timely

1079
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,160
investigation

1080
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,040
and remediation outcome that reduces

1081
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,720
risk to the organization

1082
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,160
and if we can measure that in terms of

1083
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,320
of how that manifests how often it

1084
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,480
manifests and our effectiveness in doing

1085
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,800
it

1086
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
and finding where our dwell and process

1087
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,119
gaps are we can start to deliver

1088
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,040
meaningful metrics that allow us to look

1089
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
at areas to improve and measure

1090
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,640
the improvement to our security

1091
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
operations as an example

1092
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
and also use meaningful risk metrics

1093
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,320
when it comes to making risk decisions

1094
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,920
which shouldn't be beyond the width of

1095
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,359
man but appears to be when it comes to a

1096
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,920
lot of organizations

1097
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,599
and also kind of the one vital thing

1098
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,119
that almost always gets lost in this is

1099
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,680
a feedback loop to the user

1100
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,599
so of course the result of everything

1101
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,200
that we want to do we always want to go

1102
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,240
back to the user

1103
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,560
and inform them what happened because

1104
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,839
the worst thing that we can possibly do

1105
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,599
is get users to report things to us and

1106
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,119
never ever go back to them and tell them

1107
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,880
what happened as a result of it because

1108
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,240
why the hell should they do it a second

1109
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
time if it just disappears into a black

1110
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,280
box

1111
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,200
a we start to lose the engagement with

1112
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,520
users and b we lose a potential touch

1113
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,359
point with the user to educate

1114
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,960
if they're reporting spam to us we can

1115
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,240
start to educate them on the difference

1116
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,359
between spam and fishing

1117
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,440
if they make the right decision and

1118
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,480
report something

1119
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
that is potentially fishing a

1120
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,440
potentially malicious email to us and we

1121
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,480
can take an action

1122
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,000
let's go and reward them let's go and

1123
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,440
touch them let's go and talk to them

1124
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,040
let's go and praise them let's go and

1125
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,160
show that we're a care and sharing

1126
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,520
security team and maybe people will

1127
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,880
start engaging with us more and more and

1128
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,160
more because we're human beings and

1129
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,279
we're just trying to do a good job

1130
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,400
and then when you look at all those

1131
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,359
different things that i've just

1132
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,920
absolutely whistled up through there

1133
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
how much of that can you directly

1134
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,320
control

1135
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,760
and how much of that can you influence

1136
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,280
and where do you need to beg steal or

1137
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,760
borrow

1138
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,000
to make a meaningful impact at one of

1139
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,440
the stages

1140
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,480
in that process flow all the way through

1141
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,119
from

1142
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,040
raising awareness about phishing emails

1143
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
through to enacting and purging them

1144
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,960
from a mailbox before users

1145
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
uh interact with them and enhancing our

1146
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,720
controls related to the

1147
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,160
iocs that you've picked up and also

1148
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,599
sharing that as threat intelligence with

1149
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,680
other partners

1150
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,480
what can we actually do today what do we

1151
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,640
need to involve suppliers or other teams

1152
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,599
in

1153
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,440
are we able to do that in an effective

1154
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,880
way and can we do it better

1155
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,560
now remember this is all just one

1156
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
initiative within awareness

1157
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,160
so imagine the possibilities if we did

1158
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,560
this with everything

1159
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,920
and if you think in a goal-oriented way

1160
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,839
then you can spider into all sorts of

1161
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,160
areas

1162
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,800
and then if you look at that you can

1163
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,320
spider into them for a reason because

1164
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,000
there are clear touch points

1165
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,320
clear touch points between them and you

1166
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,920
can start to see these knock-on effects

1167
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,440
you can start to see these dependencies

1168
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,880
and you can start to see the building

1169
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,040
blocks and links

1170
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,119
and each component or dots if you're

1171
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,880
joining the dots

1172
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,560
when it spiders off before you know it

1173
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,119
you'll have multiple junction points

1174
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,200
multiple dots that feed into several

1175
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,240
different areas

1176
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,839
which will tell you they're really

1177
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,440
important things they're key

1178
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,520
stages and key dots within your

1179
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,480
organization

1180
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,160
and those are the things that you really

1181
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
need to be good at and the things that

1182
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,920
they initially touch that they receive

1183
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,480
from

1184
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
and put out too because that's where

1185
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,079
their key dependencies and outcomes

1186
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,920
are and that's areas where you can

1187
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,599
really start to push outwards from each

1188
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,200
of those central dots that are really

1189
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,000
really important

1190
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,920
really heavy usage and actually start to

1191
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,280
build the things around them to make

1192
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,720
them better and better and slicker and

1193
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,118
slicker

1194
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,119
but only by kind of thinking in a more

1195
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,440
strategic way in a more linear way

1196
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,200
and looking at these kind of linkages

1197
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,839
and joins

1198
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,119
can we really define actual maturity

1199
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:07,839
uplifts

1200
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,280
and that's not to say they're all easy

1201
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
that's not by any way stretch

1202
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,960
the imagination but you can start to see

1203
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,640
benefits and a rationale of aiming

1204
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,240
towards them

1205
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,800
and why and you're in a much more

1206
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,640
coherent space

1207
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,880
if you're able to first see the dots and

1208
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,480
see the linkage between these different

1209
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,720
aspects of what you do on a daily basis

1210
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,599
and then join them and not just at

1211
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,760
singular initiative level but actually

1212
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,000
at goal level you can start to look at

1213
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,720
wider

1214
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,079
goals and also how they

1215
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,160
feed into other areas of the business

1216
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,000
that you interact with on a daily basis

1217
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,359
there's something more here about just

1218
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,040
identifying and visualizing an

1219
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,000
understanding pathways and properly

1220
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,319
linking them to develop a coherent

1221
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:56,880
picture

1222
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,079
across your organization

1223
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,839
now one thing that will really jump out

1224
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,760
here is relationships relationships are

1225
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,880
so

1226
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,400
so important you can basically just go

1227
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,839
out and spend on technology and hope for

1228
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:10,400
the best

1229
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
uh and you can try to follow these

1230
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,800
policy pathways effectively

1231
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,240
and drive maintainable change but to do

1232
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,160
the latter requires a heavy investment

1233
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,440
in relationships

1234
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
then and that might seem a bit weird but

1235
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,520
yes relationships um

1236
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,760
hopefully i've articulated a little bit

1237
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,160
maybe sporadically

1238
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,640
that a hell of a lot of security both

1239
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,319
what you do today or might do

1240
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,440
differently tomorrow

1241
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,319
actually sits outside of security or

1242
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,480
relies heavily on things outside of

1243
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,760
security

1244
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,200
now and even more so when you look

1245
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,119
beyond this simple example

1246
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,720
and factoring things like users and

1247
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,000
privileges and assets hard soft virtual

1248
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,280
and the absolute myriad others

1249
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,040
don't even start on patching and how

1250
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,119
much that might even actually be yours

1251
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:57,680
and how much

1252
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,760
it might rely on many other people who

1253
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,319
organize teams across our organization

1254
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,520
and when there's other teams

1255
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,599
and other people and potentially

1256
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,599
conflicting priorities

1257
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,720
regardless that they're not in your

1258
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,400
direct control

1259
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,319
so what you have to do is foster an

1260
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,480
ability to exert some influence

1261
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
or control and that's done through

1262
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,160
relationships

1263
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,560
at an individual at a team people and

1264
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,400
process relationships

1265
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,599
and it doesn't come easy and often these

1266
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,440
teams are not focused on security

1267
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,240
believe it or not they don't live your

1268
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:34,800
world

1269
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,680
every hour of every single day or at all

1270
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,839
be cognizant of who they are

1271
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,839
listen engage as a human and build a

1272
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,560
relationship

1273
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,319
um the approach to identifying these

1274
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,680
pathways and dependencies

1275
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,880
and teams and processes and

1276
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,720
relationships will help in bridging gaps

1277
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,079
in your effectiveness

1278
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,240
um it's about clarity and honesty and

1279
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,240
taking the time to understand and think

1280
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,359
wider

1281
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,880
building a picture and through this

1282
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,800
identifying where there are gaps or weak

1283
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,960
components and areas for improvement

1284
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,880
um maybe some kind of road map who knows

1285
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,359
much of which is going to be free it's

1286
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,880
not going to be a technological fix it's

1287
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,079
not going to be a panacea

1288
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,680
the predominant cost will be time and

1289
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,640
effort and taking that step forward and

1290
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,960
being the human being and giving as much

1291
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,480
as receiving

1292
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,400
think of bridging like drawing the line

1293
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,920
between two dots

1294
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,839
um the picture is not completed there's

1295
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,760
gaps between some of the dots

1296
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,240
the lines may not be bowls from day one

1297
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,440
you know there might be pencil there

1298
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,119
might be dotted lines but some linkage

1299
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:33,839
is better than

1300
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,280
non and it starts with finding the dots

1301
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,839
in the first place

1302
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,280
so when you're looking to bridge these

1303
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,200
gaps between teams or

1304
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
if you know just alpha techie banging

1305
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,040
heads against other teams including

1306
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,079
suppliers

1307
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,160
it can be really really really easy to

1308
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,680
fall into a cycle of distrust and

1309
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,960
conflicts

1310
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
easy without even trying especially if

1311
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,720
you're alpha techies it

1312
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,240
just happens in seconds um

1313
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,520
when you're only looking at your

1314
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
perspective or your need

1315
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,200
it rarely achieves much other than the

1316
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,960
occasional fleeting win

1317
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,720
when you're proving them wrong getting

1318
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,000
one over on them

1319
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,680
um basically getting some success at

1320
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,359
their outcome which we're at their

1321
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,240
expense

1322
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,000
which kind of makes your thing move

1323
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,920
better a little bit but then also drives

1324
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,040
a team that doesn't like you and

1325
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,400
therefore will be a blocker to you in

1326
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,760
the future especially when you need it

1327
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,599
what's the point

1328
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,119
what we also need to do here is change

1329
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,040
behavior which can be

1330
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,440
really difficult sometimes for security

1331
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,880
teams it can be very difficult for

1332
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,680
technology

1333
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,400
teams in general and technologists what

1334
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,920
we need to do is encourage teams

1335
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,760
individuals and yourself to reach out

1336
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,119
and take the first step

1337
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,200
in understanding what these other teams

1338
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,880
are all about what their drivers are

1339
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,400
their overheads their blockages their

1340
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,000
culture their ethos

1341
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,720
take the first step towards empathy

1342
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,400
you'll all have roles to play in the

1343
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,640
success of the organization you work for

1344
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,000
and supply too um take that step help

1345
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,680
yourselves to understand how you can

1346
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,720
make

1347
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,040
interaction more empathetic more

1348
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,119
collaborative and common understanding

1349
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,280
with other people's purposes

1350
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,040
and where you have conflict or blockers

1351
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,880
how often do you work towards

1352
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,440
making

1353
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,599
that mutual concession or even conceding

1354
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,720
ground

1355
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,280
to make their work lives easier not

1356
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:21,760
yours

1357
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,400
theirs take the first step off of the

1358
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,079
hand of collaboration it's honestly far

1359
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,680
more beneficial in the long run

1360
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,680
and in that way kind of a mutual culture

1361
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,880
is born

1362
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,880
it means to build relationships

1363
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
streamline processes

1364
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,800
join these dots and take a dotted line

1365
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,000
into a full

1366
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,200
thick bold line or remove a dot

1367
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,040
altogether and go straight between the

1368
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,680
two

1369
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,880
overcome blockages moreover demonstrate

1370
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,960
to other teams how by taking that step

1371
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,800
of being the conciliatory

1372
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,640
team being the team that reaches out

1373
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,240
first you can work towards a more

1374
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,839
fruitful engagement and ultimately

1375
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,720
success

1376
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,680
mutual success times felt building

1377
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,040
relationships developing an

1378
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,480
understanding of other teams and

1379
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,880
encouraging the culture of communication

1380
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,760
will be timed far better spent than on

1381
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,119
angst or conflict

1382
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,640
or just on technology in isolation

1383
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,720
as a leader it's absolutely imperative

1384
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,079
that you demonstrate the behaviors

1385
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,960
both to your team and to theirs and as

1386
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,400
team members don't be afraid to take the

1387
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,480
step as well sometimes you know

1388
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,240
your leadership might not see it you

1389
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,000
recognize that you have a dependency

1390
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,400
a dwell because of this lack of

1391
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,920
interaction or relationship between

1392
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,760
teams between two dots

1393
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
in the overall picture don't be scared

1394
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,880
to reach out yourself

1395
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,720
and start to make that happen and start

1396
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,960
to build that relationship

1397
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,839
it doesn't happen overnight and nor does

1398
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,520
the ultimate success

1399
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,200
but start along the path

1400
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,599
um i've been guilty of falling into into

1401
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,800
the conflict trap

1402
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
on many many occasions sometimes just

1403
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,160
down to dislike

1404
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,640
dislike of an individual person and i

1405
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,480
can honestly say all it's done is waste

1406
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,520
time and energy

1407
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,520
uh i might have felt good once by

1408
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,720
beating them in a meeting and getting

1409
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,319
one over them and

1410
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,200
honestly it achieved nothing my best

1411
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,720
successes came from actually making

1412
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,839
mutual concessions

1413
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,960
with suppliers as well who made money

1414
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,800
off my concessions but it actually meant

1415
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,640
that i'd achieved a better outcome

1416
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,240
and i got a better relationship with

1417
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,520
them not even meeting halfway sometimes

1418
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,839
but building relationships and building

1419
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:24,800
trust

1420
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,720
and relationships that continue to

1421
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,160
thrive um

1422
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,240
making incremental gains in what i

1423
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,160
wanted to achieve and forging alliances

1424
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,520
with other people who would then help

1425
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,480
fight my corner

1426
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,720
came to other bridges and other gaps and

1427
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,400
this has been where the good gets

1428
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,440
done recognizing these dots and starting

1429
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,880
to actually build between them and none

1430
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,400
of this is technology driven this is me

1431
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,079
building relationships and being a human

1432
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:46,640
being

1433
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,200
and being conciliatory crowd and

1434
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,040
actually wanting to work with people

1435
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,280
sometimes you've got to continue 100 to

1436
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,800
someone else's way of working

1437
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,559
it's just how it is but if it gets

1438
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,920
things moving and improves what you can

1439
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,200
do today then do it

1440
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,680
don't be afraid to give ground you can

1441
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,319
work on it as a build for a relationship

1442
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,839
and they'll see you just wanting to work

1443
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,760
with them not independently or against

1444
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,200
them and it all starts with you making

1445
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
that first step to conciliation

1446
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,640
don't wait for someone else to take it

1447
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,520
because you're going to be waiting

1448
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,359
forever and it's going to achieve

1449
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,960
nothing and put simply will change by

1450
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,640
thinking differently by approaching

1451
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,079
things differently and it's why i talk

1452
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,440
about things like horizontal thinking

1453
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,160
joining the darts

1454
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,480
linear just to illustrate how things

1455
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,839
join in this fashion

1456
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,599
against the backdrop of an industry that

1457
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,440
drives us towards vertical thinking that

1458
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,200
drives us towards silos and magic

1459
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,040
quadrants of waves and stuff that

1460
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,559
doesn't join up

1461
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,960
and of course it aims to make us believe

1462
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,000
that our problems are

1463
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,200
irreducibly complex and we can't

1464
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,800
possibly solve these problems without

1465
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,119
faith in a vendor or consultancy an msp

1466
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,000
whoever

1467
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,240
 leader whereas actually they're not

1468
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,160
irreducibly complex no matter how much

1469
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,760
you're told about sophistication

1470
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,400
legacy debt whatever it happens to be

1471
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,680
you can break things down into

1472
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,359
understandable components for which you

1473
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:02,000
can then start

1474
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,839
to build that spider's web of knowledge

1475
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,040
of that component

1476
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,720
and how all the things are joined to it

1477
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,880
in these linear pathways

1478
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,160
and if you can do that then you can

1479
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,280
improve on some of these things

1480
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,960
gradually and you'll get better

1481
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,680
and you'll get better in meaningful ways

1482
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,079
but always try to build upon an overall

1483
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,240
view it's bloody hard

1484
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,079
but even at a local level you can

1485
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,839
improve whether that's your daily

1486
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,680
processes or building relationships with

1487
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,440
dependent teams your overall strategy

1488
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,200
your adversarial understanding

1489
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,640
none of it happens overnight most of all

1490
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,599
though

1491
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,800
think differently don't just do what

1492
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,079
industry pushes you to do

1493
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,079
don't be that person who says where are

1494
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,800
you on the on the quadrant

1495
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,480
be someone that looks and kind of says

1496
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,720
if i'm making a technological investment

1497
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,640
what are the dominoes either side of it

1498
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,480
or all around it that need to actually

1499
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,240
be in place and need to work well for

1500
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,680
that technology to have a material

1501
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,480
impact

1502
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,079
and to ensure that technology doesn't

1503
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,160
drip from where it is today

1504
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,920
implementation as an effective

1505
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,760
controller effectively in whatever way

1506
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
to somewhere in the future where frankly

1507
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,359
it does bother all for me to do

1508
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,280
all of that you need to approach things

1509
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,720
in a different way

1510
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,000
and that's what i'm talking about

1511
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,440
horizontal thinking that's what i'm

1512
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,240
talking about

1513
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,359
joining the dots to cyber security

1514
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,040
and adversaries are getting more

1515
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,559
sophisticated what we do

1516
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,480
so is technology in fact it has done

1517
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,079
what i've been walking on to you right

1518
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:24,559
now

1519
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,160
the tools of their disposal their

1520
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,680
awareness their abilities it's all the

1521
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,079
same

1522
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,640
the same can be said for defenders yeah

1523
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,800
adversaries though are not held back by

1524
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,160
overarching legacy that we insecurity

1525
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,880
or the silos that we create and maintain

1526
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,880
beautifully for ourselves

1527
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,319
there's no quick fix there's no magic

1528
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,000
bullet there's no fifth generation

1529
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,800
cyber widget that will solve our ills

1530
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,400
there is incremental and well thought

1531
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,359
out change

1532
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,520
that leads to improvements and the

1533
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,280
improvements that mean something in our

1534
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,800
spider's web of actually effective

1535
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,200
security

1536
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,359
it's that changing focus and mindset and

1537
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,119
operation that makes a difference

1538
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,119
and we can use things existing within

1539
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,040
our organization to our advantage to

1540
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,079
accelerate change

1541
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,359
things like if you've got digital

1542
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,240
transformation programs um

1543
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,480
but the main thing in there is you have

1544
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,040
to be able to articulate things well

1545
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,040
you have to be able to identify all

1546
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,480
these different parts

1547
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,000
whether it's linear parts of one

1548
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,760
particular problem and

1549
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,640
actually articulate them to other people

1550
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,079
whether it's other teams to

1551
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,000
process owners to investment boards

1552
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,240
business cases to actually build up the

1553
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,319
design of how we join these dots in a

1554
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:32,720
much

1555
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,359
better much streamlined slicker manner

1556
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,520
to operate that overall process in a

1557
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,079
better way and achieve an actual goal

1558
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,200
um if we joined all of our dots we might

1559
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,160
just build a picture

1560
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,880
of achievable maturity and have the

1561
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,720
ability to articulate it properly and

1562
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,000
set out the steps required to go

1563
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,640
there and give it a go generally it

1564
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,880
can't be any worse than what we do today

1565
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,119
and that generally is it thanks

1566
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,319
hopefully that made a little bit of

1567
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:05,839
sense you nailed that

1568
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,520
ed's testimony there was really um a

1569
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,640
point about people

1570
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,559
at the end of the day it's all about

1571
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,400
people um

1572
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,720
it can always only ever be about people

1573
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,920
and that's the only way you're gonna get

1574
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,839
things done right

1575
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,440
there's a reason why people process

1576
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,200
technology in that order yeah

1577
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,960
yeah people people and process you know

1578
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
you you look at as i said you know you

1579
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,400
just look at kind of i want to make my

1580
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,160
people aware of phishing emails so that

1581
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,040
they'll

1582
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,960
hopefully be able to spot them report

1583
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,480
them and we'll do something meaningful

1584
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,000
and actually protect the organization

1585
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,200
how much of that how much of that is

1586
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,400
technology and how much of that is

1587
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,000
people in process i'll give you a clue

1588
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,640
90 percent of its people process yeah

1589
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,040
yeah

1590
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,960
you know when you when you rely on

1591
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,559
technology to do it as well and you

1592
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:57,760
haven't got the people process

1593
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,040
it's when things start to go seriously

1594
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,440
wrong anyway and usually people don't

1595
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,640
have the processes to manage the

1596
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,920
technology if they haven't got that in

1597
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,359
place so it all falls apart right

1598
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,839
house cars it does it does you know

1599
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,359
which is why we use five percent of what

1600
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,079
we buy

1601
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,680
and why kind of we might implement

1602
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,359
things you know in absolute perfect

1603
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,880
state from day one and within a year

1604
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,480
they've drifted into god knows what

1605
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,520
because we've not understood the

1606
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,880
processes that run around them

1607
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,960
yeah and for years like change

1608
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,240
management yeah

1609
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,480
and for years you'd hear this notion

1610
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,079
horrible notion i hate it that

1611
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,520
people are the soft underbelly of the

1612
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,599
organization what a terrible

1613
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,280
thought actually people are your

1614
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,119
frontline defenders of your organization

1615
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,240
yeah they're the people at the front

1616
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,920
line that are going to actually stand in

1617
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,640
the way

1618
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,839
of you as a business and a devastating

1619
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,119
attack

1620
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,720
yeah absolutely and and also you know

1621
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,079
it's not just those people there but

1622
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,000
then you know your next line is also

1623
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,599
people because that's your

1624
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,040
that's either your awareness teams who

1625
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,480
are trying to drive awareness to those

1626
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:52,880
those

1627
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,400
end users or it's your operations team

1628
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,000
who can actually

1629
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,359
risk management teams and it's all

1630
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,599
people it's all people that need to be

1631
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,359
effective in what they do but they all

1632
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,520
need to be effective

1633
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,599
at each step and they can't be effective

1634
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,359
in isolation because actually it doesn't

1635
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,760
work

1636
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,680
if i've got two effective people here

1637
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,440
that aren't joined up then actually

1638
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,160
are they really being affected yeah yeah

1639
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,760
so notionally

1640
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,599
we could never argue that people within

1641
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,359
the organization or people generally are

1642
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,440
the weakest link people are actually the

1643
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,599
strongest link

1644
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,040
i i would i would probably say that we

1645
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,440
we enable people to be weaker links than

1646
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,640
they should be

1647
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,280
because we don't because we don't create

1648
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,559
the links

1649
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,000
yeah so in fact we disable people

1650
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,480
yeah yeah in a sense yes people should

1651
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,400
be your first line of defense basically

1652
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,559
really in that sense they they should be

1653
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,160
but if you think kind of you

1654
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,680
you know if we talk about people being a

1655
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,119
link then there needs to be something

1656
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,559
for it to link to

1657
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,480
if it doesn't link to it then is it even

1658
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,160
a link yeah

1659
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,599
yeah and then of course that makes the

1660
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,119
link to something else you think about a

1661
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:57,760
chain that's

1662
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,440
why we talk about change and why we talk

1663
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,200
about links and linkages and yet when it

1664
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:01,920
comes to

1665
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,440
actually doing stuff inside we never

1666
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,040
think about links

1667
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,720
yeah and we don't move forward

1668
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,079
okay um thanks ed really spirited

1669
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:12,880
testimony

1670
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,480
you're a great guy and i hope you get

1671
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,400
some work sorted out soon

00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,599
cheers give me a job well you

1673
