[Music]

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,760
welcome back guys

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,559
um thanks for being with us today uh

4
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,239
fantastic event and then some great

5
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,520
talks so far

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
um and we really appreciate all the

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
donations to the gofundme page

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,719
we've gone past seven thousand pounds

9
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,039
we're well past that which is phenomenal

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,440
um yeah fantastic talks but we've got

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,320
one more to go

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,960
uh last but by no means least uh james

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,360
bohr so over to you james

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,600
thank you i'm going to be talking about

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,440
some techniques which i've

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
swiped from medical research and can be

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,760
very useful with cyber security so the

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,280
obligatory a bit about me

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
uh i'm a security consultant i've got

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
twitter linkedin and email as most

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
people do and i get tired a lot

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,360
there we go um

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
right figures of merit figures of merit

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,479
are

25
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,920
part of what we're going to be talking

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,759
about but this is just a quick

27
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,640
overview of them figures for merit are

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
simply numbers that rate something

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,079
same way you would do scoring in an rfp

30
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,240
that's all it is it's a way to get a

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,079
single number

32
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,200
to rate a system or a solution

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,119
and give you an idea of what it is

34
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,040
sometimes you might have two or three

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,439
sometimes it is boiled down to one

36
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,320
scoring

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,040
in rfps usually goes across anything

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,119
between four to twenty

39
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,280
and when you're checking the technical

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520
ability of a solution

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,799
you probably get one out of it at the

42
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,360
end

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
you know a star ranking of yes this is

44
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,560
good or

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,959
no this is bad and frankly that's

46
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,200
not particularly useful because a good

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
figure of merit should tell you whether

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
the solution is appropriate not just

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
whether it's generally good

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,400
so we'll be looking at a way to get

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
forms

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
for almost any solution you want to

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
and this is where the matrix of

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
confusion

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,319
or confusion matrices which some people

56
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,680
do get confused about

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,720
come in but first some background

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,519
uh security testing life cycle you may

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,800
have a different view on this

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
that's fine this is just the one that

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
i'm working to

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,959
for the purposes of this presentation so

63
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,920
it will be quick

64
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,680
i do promise we have definition

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,519
yes we want to do this what is it we

66
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,800
want to do okay

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
design how do we want to do it

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,000
development

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,080
let's actually start putting it together

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,519
doing the coding

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,080
deployment let's lift and shift it into

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,519
a live environment

73
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,159
and monitoring and maintenance let's

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,840
keep an eye on it in that live

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,200
environment to make sure

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
it doesn't go horribly wrong really nice

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
and simple

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,599
and each one of those cycles has

79
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,760
part of the uh denning cycle in it let

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,000
me just lean out of the way of check

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,040
so plan do check act which hopefully

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,239
everyone's fairly familiar with uh

83
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
plan is what are we going to do

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,080
do is do it check is well

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,519
did what we did meet our plan did it

86
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,200
hit what we wanted it to hit and act is

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
anything that didn't work fix it work

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,840
out what to do on the next planning

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,159
stage and standardize anything that did

90
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,360
work

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
again very simple i'm not doing a talk

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,840
on project management here

93
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,519
so hopefully everyone's comfortable with

94
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,000
those

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
let me know if you want to go into them

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,439
more and i'll introduce you to a prince2

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,040
guy

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
but otherwise we'll get onto the actual

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,879
meat of this which is the

100
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,680
matrices of confusion which sound pretty

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,159
cool

102
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,478
and really are truth beauty and tests

103
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,680
the first thing we need to use

104
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
a confusion matrix is to establish our

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
ground truth

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,160
now our grand truth can be almost

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,440
anything

108
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
we don't expect to get the grand

109
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,720
ultimate truth of how the universe works

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
since we're looking at it from a

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,320
security point of view

112
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
we'll ignore the philosophy we will

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,479
dictate that what we say is true for the

114
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,800
purposes of our measurement

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
is true it's absolutely true

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
it's unquestionable if we have caused

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,960
question it we have to start over

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
so rather than saying well we want to

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
test against every single possible

120
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,039
vulnerability

121
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,199
which isn't useful we would take a

122
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
sample of what is true

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
and this is the same thing in medical

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,280
testing it's a sample of the population

125
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,199
and that sample will vary and you'll be

126
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,400
more accurate with it

127
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
depending on the stage in diagnosis that

128
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,160
you've reached

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,560
so we have a sample of the truth that we

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,280
say is

131
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,479
absolutely fundamentally true and

132
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,400
we will not question it while we're

133
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,799
testing

134
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,000
and we know what our tests will do they

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
will say a vulnerability

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,520
does or does not exist if it exists

137
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,240
yes it's there and if it doesn't exist

138
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
no it's not

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,160
problem is that our tests don't

140
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,759
necessarily match to

141
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
the truth so where our tests say that

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,160
there's a vulnerability

143
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
we'll call that a positive and anything

144
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,680
that's

145
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
not positive and isn't within our sample

146
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,080
we will just discard we can say it's a

147
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,880
negative

148
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
and if it's a negative that we've taken

149
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,440
as part of our sample for a defined

150
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,319
system

151
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
then that's fine we can keep it as a

152
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,440
negative if it's

153
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,639
not in our sample we ignore it

154
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,759
completely from the scoring and

155
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
where our test gives us a positive

156
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,160
and we know that there is a genuine

157
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
vulnerability or a genuine instant in

158
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,039
progress

159
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,520
because we've designed this system as a

160
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
test for

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,039
a security solution whether that's a

162
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,479
vulnerability scanner

163
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,000
whether it's a patch detection solution

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
whether it's for a pen testing company

165
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,919
because you could absolutely use this

166
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,639
method

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,960
to get a good assessment of pen testing

168
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
companies

169
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,240
whatever it is where the test gives us

170
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
the same result as reality

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
what we know is already there that's

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
great and we call that a true positive

173
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,199
or negative

174
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,560
and where it doesn't that's

175
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,039
a false positive or negative so just for

176
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,479
a quick summary on this which will

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
hopefully work

178
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,720
i have here a load of tests

179
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,199
and let's say that the green ones

180
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,400
are genuine things i already know are

181
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
actually there the red ones

182
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
are false positives that have been

183
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,080
picked up by my test

184
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,000
this is where the matrix bit comes in so

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,960
actual positives

186
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,840
sit over here

187
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
and actual negatives sit over there

188
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,840
great

189
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,680
but that doesn't tell me how my test

190
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
performed

191
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,280
for that we get the matrix and

192
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,239
there we have say

193
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,319
and i've just realized i've got the

194
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,560
colors wrong it's quite difficult doing

195
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,840
it on the screen but

196
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,120
we've got two true positives we've got

197
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,520
two

198
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,280
true negatives we've got three

199
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,599
false positives and we've got three

200
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,800
false negatives

201
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,680
the false negatives are generally not a

202
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
good thing

203
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,080
false positives generate work but how

204
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,319
important they are how bad they are for

205
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,000
our figure of merit for whichever

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
solution we're looking at

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,879
depends where we are in the life cycle

208
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,120
so hopefully this has made some sense to

209
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,440
you and we'll get into how numbers are

210
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,000
generated

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
but the important bit is the test

212
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,000
will tell us positive or negative the

213
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,719
test

214
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,719
will tell us positive or negative for a

215
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,719
particular finding

216
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,200
we won't know if that test is giving us

217
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,719
the truth unless we've already

218
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,159
established it

219
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,600
so true and

220
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
tested positive true positive

221
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,399
but tested negative

222
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,320
true negatives and

223
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:09,839
false positives and back to the slides

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,480
okay so yes not confusing at all despite

225
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,360
being the

226
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,920
matrixes of confusion or confusion

227
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,800
matrix

228
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,880
take your pick on which one you will

229
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,519
either have a positive or negative test

230
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,000
result for something that is or is not

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,160
truly positive or negative and that

232
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
is less confusing than it sounds but

233
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,320
only once you've actually got the hang

234
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,839
of it this does confuse

235
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,959
clinicians as well i have that on very

236
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,760
good authority

237
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,920
so to do some examples we have a test of

238
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
a positive

239
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
where a vulnerability scanner let's say

240
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,040
or a pen test

241
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,920
said there was a potential sql injection

242
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
on our site

243
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,839
we know because we set the site up and

244
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,920
we are using it as an assessment that

245
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,839
yes there was sql injection

246
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
on this site so lovely we've got a true

247
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,560
positive

248
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,200
let's go for a pen test again and this

249
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
time the

250
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,200
test the pen testers are telling us that

251
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
there's potential cross-site

252
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,079
scripting well because of the way that

253
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,800
it's built

254
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,480
we know that this is not actually an

255
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
exploitable finding

256
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,399
on this particular environment so that

257
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,040
would be

258
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,079
a false positive

259
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,880
another example there's a exploitable

260
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,920
vulnerability

261
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,000
which our vulnerability scanning

262
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
software did not pick up it didn't pick

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
up that we're still running java 3

264
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
as an example well clearly

265
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,120
false negative don't really want that

266
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,519
and finally true negative that's

267
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,279
anything that the test didn't find

268
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,040
and isn't there and again it's not that

269
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
useful for us because there's too many

270
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,800
potential vulnerabilities

271
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,680
but if we've taken a clear sample we've

272
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,959
defined it

273
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,800
then we can use those true negatives

274
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,720
right that's confusion matrix or the

275
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,800
start of one we ignore the uncertainty

276
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
and say we know what the truth is we're

277
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,079
lying

278
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,279
but it's good enough for maths and we

279
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,959
say that our test sample

280
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,600
is absolutely representative and

281
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,399
accurate

282
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,240
and cannot be questioned while we're

283
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,200
using it for assessment

284
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
so there's some numbers that we can get

285
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
out of these matrices

286
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,240
and these are the bits where it becomes

287
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
useful to us

288
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,839
the first one is accuracy and all that

289
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,160
is

290
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,320
is we take the true positives and true

291
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,519
negatives

292
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,399
and divide them by all positives and all

293
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,440
negatives

294
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,320
and all that tells us is how many times

295
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,519
the test has been

296
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,120
right and how many times it's been wrong

297
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
it's a good general measure it would be

298
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
lovely if vulnerability scanners did

299
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,240
this against say

300
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,360
a standard list of 100 vulnerabilities

301
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,920
for a particular test system no one does

302
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,639
it yet

303
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,839
but it is potentially possible but it's

304
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,880
not actually that

305
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,519
useful a number because yes it tells us

306
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,040
it's accurate

307
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,120
it doesn't tell us how useful it is at a

308
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,160
particular stage

309
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,760
in the life cycle so moving on we have

310
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,079
the

311
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,560
error rate that's really just the

312
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
opposite of the accuracy it's

313
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,519
where we know it's been wrong and again

314
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,320
not incredibly useful for us it's a very

315
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,120
generic

316
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,000
figure of merit it does have its place

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,399
but

318
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,040
we really want to be looking a bit

319
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,920
beyond it

320
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,040
you could however use it to test

321
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,760
or to assess similar systems same way

322
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
you could with accuracy

323
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,040
if you've got two vulnerability scanners

324
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,959
for example that you're looking at

325
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,720
with the same life cycle stage

326
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,480
test them both get the accuracy and

327
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,839
error rate for both

328
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,839
and it will give you an idea

329
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,360
much more usefully we have the true

330
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,959
positive rate now

331
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,000
medical science this is uh seen as

332
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,320
sensitivity or the recall rate or the

333
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,040
hit rate

334
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,880
and there is no standardized terminology

335
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,639
you will find all sorts of other terms

336
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,680
being used

337
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,800
but true positive rate is quite accurate

338
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,480
that is the number of true positives

339
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,320
over true positives and false negatives

340
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,560
so from a security point of view what

341
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,440
this gives us

342
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,920
is a measure of residual risk after

343
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,279
we've acted on

344
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,560
every finding from a test

345
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
so we ignore the false positives we

346
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,720
ignore the extra work that false

347
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
positives will generate

348
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,440
what it does tell us is what's left over

349
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,760
how

350
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,480
likely is it that we've missed something

351
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,839
and what percentage

352
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,040
will we have missed so the residual risk

353
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,079
in the system

354
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,320
can be predicted to a degree by looking

355
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,480
at the true positive rate

356
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
and we will come back to this uh true

357
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,399
negative rate

358
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
almost exactly the same thing but

359
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
we have two options and this goes back

360
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,480
to

361
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,800
not being able to pick up negatives

362
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,199
easily

363
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,000
because our potential negatives are

364
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,720
everything

365
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
that isn't present in our system

366
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,279
if we're not defining a set sample of

367
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,040
say 100 vulnerabilities

368
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,279
40 of which we know on present and are

369
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,079
counting as

370
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,360
true negatives then we can ignore this

371
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,800
completely

372
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
if we are taking that sample where we've

373
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,000
got negatives

374
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,800
included in our truth so we can measure

375
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,560
against them

376
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,000
this becomes potentially useful but

377
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,279
what it's telling us is

378
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,000
how good it is at telling us what work

379
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,959
we do not

380
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,399
need to do and that does become

381
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,959
important

382
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,519
and we have a couple more measures we

383
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,560
have the

384
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,680
positive predictive value which is true

385
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,399
positives

386
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,160
over true positives and false positives

387
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,079
and this will tell us how useful it is

388
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,440
this is the precision

389
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,519
this is how many of the positive

390
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,440
findings are actually

391
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,000
useful to us how many of them let us

392
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,959
solve something

393
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,880
and how many of them if we act on all of

394
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
them generate

395
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,600
wasted effort and

396
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,040
the true negative negative predictive

397
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,680
value

398
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
which doesn't really have any other

399
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
names that i've been able to find

400
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,399
because people don't really use it

401
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,680
it's potentially a useful measure again

402
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,079
but

403
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,720
negatives aren't of as much interest to

404
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,560
us most of the time

405
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,399
because they're telling us work we don't

406
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,160
need to do however

407
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,440
if you had a system which had a perfect

408
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,279
true negative predicted value so

409
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,120
npv of one you would be able to say that

410
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,360
anything the system does not find

411
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,120
you can ignore if you find a system like

412
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,399
that whether it's a

413
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,320
vulnerability scanner a pen testing

414
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
company

415
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
threat modelling approach anything

416
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
please please tell me about it because

417
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,079
i've yet to find one

418
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,160
mainly because that would be a perfect

419
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,560
system

420
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,519
okay so

421
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,160
going back to our life cycle at

422
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
different life cycle stages

423
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
different things matter and this is

424
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,560
again tying into the

425
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,160
medical approach so

426
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,199
when remediation is expensive

427
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,279
when it's difficult to carry out

428
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,360
remediation when it will generate a lot

429
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,000
of work

430
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
cost a lot of effort we really care

431
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,959
about false positives we want to have as

432
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,799
few of those as possible

433
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,599
if your false positive is going to lead

434
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,160
to

435
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
48 hours of downtime for a system

436
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,919
running through

437
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,039
millions of pounds a day you you don't

438
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,400
want false positive

439
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,679
in any circumstances so

440
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,839
remediation costs mean that we

441
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,280
care about false positives a lot more

442
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,240
when remediation costs are cheap we

443
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,080
don't care about false positives

444
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,559
what we care about are false negatives

445
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,799
we don't want to miss something

446
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,360
when it's easy to fix because if we can

447
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,320
fix it when it's

448
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,480
easy we don't have to deal with it at a

449
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
point it's expensive

450
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,559
so again going back to the life cycle

451
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
and you may be able to tell that

452
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,200
remediation costs of course

453
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
go up as you get further in the life

454
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,240
cycle

455
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,799
until you've deployed a system and

456
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,480
remediating it becomes

457
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,360
incredibly expensive because you have to

458
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,240
go all the way back to planning

459
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,880
whereas false negatives if we could pick

460
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
those up at the definition stage

461
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,039
fantastic we don't care if we get false

462
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,480
positives there

463
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
but if we can eliminate or reduce the

464
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
false negatives

465
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,559
that's great we can fix them really

466
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,160
easily because we just changed the

467
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,280
requirements

468
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,720
to include those security requirements

469
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,600
now the next step is when determining

470
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,080
the

471
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,840
actual ground truth is difficult

472
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
we have to care less about the truth

473
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,120
because it's

474
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
so much more work to do it and this

475
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,440
again ties into the life cycle

476
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,559
at the definition stage we can't tell

477
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,120
whether a particular issue is going to

478
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,000
lead

479
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,600
to further issues down the line

480
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,799
we've got a lot more uncertainty so our

481
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,520
ground truth we can be much broader with

482
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,160
make a much wider sample and we don't

483
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,960
care

484
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,280
so much about the accuracy of what's

485
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,080
true

486
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,200
we want to er on the side of caution

487
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,799
of course once the system is actually

488
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,720
deployed it's

489
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,799
relatively easy to determine ground

490
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,360
truth for any particular vulnerability

491
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,679
we can use a proof of concept and show

492
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,080
whether it can be exploited or not

493
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,120
and then we really do want to care about

494
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,400
the truth

495
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,640
so there is a trade-off

496
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,200
now quick example that i threw together

497
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,640
these are hypothetical numbers but

498
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,120
let's say we're doing a vulnerability

499
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,160
scan

500
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,039
we have a sample of standard

501
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,799
vulnerabilities which we know

502
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,080
are present in the system

503
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
anything that the scan detects

504
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
which aren't in that list are obviously

505
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
negatives

506
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,919
and we go through and we verify all of

507
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,840
the positives so we know which

508
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,880
are true positives

509
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,640
so that's how we develop our sample

510
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,919
that's how we establish the truth

511
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,039
sample systems will vary at each stage

512
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,880
in the life cycle

513
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,720
but the calculation of the figures of

514
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
merit is the same

515
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,520
at every stage

516
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,280
so here we go we've calculated our

517
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
positive predictive value

518
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,559
so it's not 0.62 whether that's good or

519
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,320
bad is hard to say we've got nothing to

520
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,000
compare it against

521
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,400
we've got our true positive rate which

522
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
is not 0.82

523
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,640
again hard to say if that's good or bad

524
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,400
nothing to compare it against

525
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,880
true negative rate is zero we've we've

526
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,440
not got

527
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,679
any true negatives because anything that

528
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,039
wasn't found by the test and wasn't in

529
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,240
our sample

530
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,720
is by default a true negative if you've

531
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
got somewhere you've

532
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,799
included a sample because you can that's

533
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,440
different matter

534
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,520
now how this actually ties into the life

535
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,679
cycle stages

536
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,960
so at the definition stage when we're

537
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,919
defining the requirements for software

538
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,880
we know that

539
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,480
the remediation costs are incredibly low

540
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,240
or ideally they should be if your

541
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,159
remediation costs are expensive at

542
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,200
definition

543
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,679
there is something fundamentally wrong

544
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,159
with how you are doing projects

545
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,679
your remediation costs when you're

546
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,760
defining the project are low so that's

547
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,799
when you want to do

548
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,480
a quick very very sensitive

549
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,520
test so you don't care

550
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,400
about false positives being picked up

551
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:48,960
but

552
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,720
you want to eliminate any false

553
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,760
negatives going through

554
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,280
however identifying true positives at

555
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,039
this stage is expensive

556
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,440
so you want your sample to be extremely

557
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,280
broad rather than saying

558
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,960
sql injection on a particular text field

559
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,000
on the site

560
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,720
you might just say code injection and

561
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,799
then you apply some general principles

562
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,960
as remediation

563
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,760
in medical testing this would be

564
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
somewhere before even the initial

565
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,240
screening

566
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,039
this would be when you're perhaps having

567
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,360
a quick chat with

568
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,000
the surgery nurse and asking for some

569
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
general health advice

570
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,240
or popping into the pharmacy

571
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,960
i've got a bit of headache or i'm

572
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,039
feeling a bit slow what do you recommend

573
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,480
well

574
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,760
eat healthy drink plenty of water

575
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,360
exercise general good practices

576
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,440
those are the remediations at this point

577
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
because we're not saying

578
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,919
anything is seriously wrong and applying

579
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,159
good hygiene and good practices

580
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,440
will help us to prevent big problems

581
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,679
further on so definition we want

582
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,919
highest possible sensitivity we want to

583
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,120
pick up

584
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,400
all of the false negatives and we don't

585
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,240
care if we pick up the false positives

586
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
because that just means we

587
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,280
expand the requirements so that they

588
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,720
include more security

589
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,360
and i've yet to see someone argue that

590
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,400
more security done

591
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,200
cheaply is a bad thing or cheaply and

592
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,440
effectively without introducing blocks

593
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,720
but that's a different argument

594
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,039
then we have the design stage

595
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,880
remediation costs are still low

596
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
this is at your architecture planning

597
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
for example

598
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,799
and yep taking the right approach so

599
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,000
high sensitivity again identifying true

600
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,640
positives

601
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
is expensive it's less expensive than at

602
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,080
the definition

603
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,559
stage because you will be saying this is

604
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,480
the technology we're using this is the

605
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
approach that we'll be taking

606
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,080
but it's a bit broader or it's

607
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,320
easier to be accurate you know that

608
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,000
you're going to use a particular

609
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
software version you know that you're

610
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
going to

611
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,159
build on aws you know that you're going

612
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,720
to build on azure

613
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
you know that you're going to use docker

614
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,120
java whatever you're using

615
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,520
you've properly selected so

616
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,480
theoretically you've got an idea

617
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,039
of what the threats are to that system

618
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,880
and this is where your threat modeling

619
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,960
can go a bit more granular

620
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
but you're not really getting into the

621
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,279
testing this is going on from the quick

622
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,520
chat with the pharmacist and more to

623
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,679
i'm going to get a personal trainer i'm

624
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,919
going to tell them what my goals are

625
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
they can walk me through it they can

626
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,880
give me more accurate life cycle

627
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,440
exercise advice target muscle groups

628
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,640
that are appropriate

629
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,600
because they're an expert in that and

630
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,279
this stage is very much

631
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,000
expert driven for the test there isn't

632
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,640
really

633
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,120
a technical solution we could deploy for

634
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,799
this a vulnerability scanner will do

635
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,520
nothing

636
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,600
for most architectural diagrams there

637
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,080
are threat modeling solutions which will

638
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,279
help

639
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,720
but even there it does come down to the

640
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,039
expertise in your design team

641
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,400
so we are still pre-gp checkup

642
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,480
if you want to take a medical view of it

643
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,799
then we move on to development now this

644
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,279
is the point where you can start talking

645
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,000
to

646
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,640
your gp you're you're starting to put

647
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,520
things together

648
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,640
you've got code going in you can do dast

649
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
you can do sassed

650
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,480
and you can measure the effectiveness of

651
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,520
those tools

652
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
you can say how many false positives a

653
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,760
particular tool picks up

654
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,080
you might have an idea of how many false

655
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,120
negatives

656
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,520
depending on what other assessments you

657
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,960
do so if you're running

658
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,320
five different tools for a proof concept

659
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,120
you might get one of them pulling out

660
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,080
true positives

661
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,880
which the other doesn't pull out at all

662
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,720
they can then go into your truth

663
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,559
as false negatives so you have got an

664
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,320
idea there of what your

665
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
false negatives are the problem is your

666
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,120
remediation costs have gone up a bit

667
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,679
here

668
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,279
because remediating anything that you

669
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,240
find

670
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,159
involves taking a step back in the

671
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,320
process or adding it to the backlog

672
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,960
it involves extra effort it could be a

673
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,600
delay

674
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,559
it could be extra expense it could be

675
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,400
almost anything but it is

676
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,480
harder to do at this stage than at the

677
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,840
design stage

678
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,679
so here we want to

679
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,720
detect fewer false positives false

680
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,799
positives now have a burden they apply

681
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,760
friction

682
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,039
to our project whereas earlier

683
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,520
false positives weren't an issue at all

684
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,159
so here

685
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,640
we care more about false positives false

686
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,360
negatives

687
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,039
are still a standard issue they might be

688
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,960
picked up later but it would be good to

689
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,120
have them knocked out now

690
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,799
this is the point where we want a

691
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,559
balance between

692
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,679
sensitivity to pick up what's true

693
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,880
and okay alert on some other things

694
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,240
and overall accuracy we don't want 90

695
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,840
percent of our findings to be false

696
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,640
positives

697
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,720
because then our development team is

698
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,279
either going to spend their entire time

699
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,440
just fixing or investigating things

700
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,120
which aren't there

701
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,559
or they're going to decide that security

702
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,000
is just wasting their time

703
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,240
and ignore everything that we send them

704
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,159
in future

705
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,720
and i've seen both of those scenarios

706
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,919
that neither of them are good

707
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,679
well you get to deployment now

708
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,120
deployment is

709
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,240
that the gp has referred us probably to

710
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
a specialist

711
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,559
we're now in a bed somewhere under

712
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,279
monitoring

713
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,840
being watched carefully remediation

714
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,399
costs

715
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,039
are high because we can't simply go back

716
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,559
and redevelop

717
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,640
we have to patch we have to go through

718
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
the full change control process

719
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,600
and even if you're working in a lean way

720
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,520
it's still something you want to

721
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,960
avoid doing the one advantage is

722
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,159
identifying true positives is much much

723
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,120
easier than it was before we can say

724
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,279
whether a vulnerability is present

725
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,880
simply by running an exploit against it

726
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,919
we can say yes it's there we know it's

727
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,960
there

728
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,000
we've got exploitation of it our lovely

729
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,640
pen testers have given us this finding

730
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
and we've verified it

731
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,880
so we at least can say well we're

732
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,320
probably not going to be getting

733
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,960
any false positives out of this because

734
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,320
we can check them much more easily

735
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,559
but if we do get false positives they

736
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,320
are very expensive to fix

737
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,159
they take a long time they involve a

738
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,919
step back it's not good

739
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,799
false negatives are what we really

740
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,960
really want to avoid at this point

741
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
however because any false negatives here

742
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,200
go into production anything we've missed

743
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,240
at this stage

744
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,679
goes into production and

745
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,000
yeah in production

746
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,640
we're no longer talking to doctors we

747
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,840
can't really do preventative measures

748
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,320
anymore so while great we can identify

749
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,200
true positives

750
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,840
although if we're talking about

751
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,279
production as

752
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,840
security monitoring rather than scanning

753
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
of vulnerabilities true positives do get

754
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,320
a bit more challenging

755
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,159
we can identify them but they're very

756
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,320
bad news

757
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,640
and if we have a false positive

758
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,600
it can have a huge impact on our system

759
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,960
it could be

760
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,760
turning off the database because there

761
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,440
was some suspicious traffic

762
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,520
and if that's a false positive it's

763
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,600
going to kick back

764
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,159
so yeah false positives are potentially

765
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:04,880
disastrous

766
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,600
they could impact the core business the

767
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,000
core of what we try and do

768
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
meanwhile false negatives are also

769
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,919
pretty disastrous because

770
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,360
false negative means we've been breached

771
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,399
we've got an ongoing issue and we've not

772
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,000
picked it up so for this point

773
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,399
we want as few false positives and

774
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,159
negatives as possible

775
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,480
we want to avoid false positives if we

776
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,880
can but false negatives are the ones we

777
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,559
absolutely have to avoid

778
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,240
so if testing let's say a sock

779
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,559
or any sort of automated machine

780
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,760
learning system

781
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,679
designed to pick up anomalous traffic or

782
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,399
attempted exploitation

783
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,600
it's very important to actually get an

784
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,559
idea

785
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,360
of what the false positives will be and

786
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,640
the false negatives

787
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,360
and you can do that using a confusion

788
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,240
matrix

789
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,360
you can run it against various tests of

790
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,799
systems that you understand

791
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,919
fully and get an idea of how it will

792
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:06,399
work

793
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,600
on a genuine but unknown

794
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,480
system one way you've not had the time

795
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,320
or not had the capability

796
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,360
to stack it all out entirely or where it

797
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,279
changes and shifts too quickly to do

798
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,360
that accurately

799
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,039
and these are not absolutely permanent

800
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,559
perfect measures these are variable

801
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,799
they are flexible but they are a guide

802
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,799
to how effective particular tooling is

803
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,480
and with that you can get an idea of

804
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,880
which tools you should be looking at at

805
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,679
each point

806
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,960
in development deployment and production

807
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,679
life cycle

808
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
so just to recap

809
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,799
and i've run a little short but

810
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,960
there's plenty of other stuff going on

811
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,919
in a little while

812
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,159
and you can always grab a cup of coffee

813
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,679
if there aren't many questions to fill

814
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,840
the gap

815
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,120
recap security assessment and monitoring

816
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
is something we can measure we can

817
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,399
measure the quality of it

818
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,440
these are tried and tested methods to

819
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,159
give us

820
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,320
ways to assess the accuracy of tests

821
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,480
these are methods that are used in

822
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,159
life-saving work these are methods that

823
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,840
will actually be being used

824
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,440
at the moment for tests to determine

825
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,559
whether they are

826
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,919
worth rolling out or not so if it's

827
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,480
a good enough method to apply to saving

828
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,679
lives

829
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,000
it's probably good enough for security

830
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,039
where

831
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,960
most of the time we're not looking to do

832
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,480
that

833
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,399
and the measurement other than getting

834
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,399
that initial sample

835
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,279
doesn't require a lot of work it's it's

836
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,000
quite easy

837
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
if you've got that sample if you've run

838
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
the tests over it

839
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,080
the maths is simple you can get the

840
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,919
numbers out

841
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,159
and once you've got the numbers out you

842
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,320
know which measure is important

843
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,480
at each stage of the life cycle you're

844
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,080
going to be using different tools at

845
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,919
different stages anyway so

846
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,519
you're going to be using threat modeling

847
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,399
early on you can use it later it's not

848
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,440
as useful

849
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,360
because you've already missed most of

850
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,799
your threats early and now

851
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,480
you're just getting a long list of stuff

852
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,159
you should have fixed

853
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,240
you can use vulnerability scanning at

854
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,080
various points in the life cycle

855
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,240
and you will be using monitoring and

856
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,840
assessment

857
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,320
hopefully you will be using it with a

858
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:38,880
sock

859
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,760
or at least some sort of monitoring and

860
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,720
alerting system towards the end

861
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,919
so we know which aspects matter most at

862
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,880
each stage of that life cycle

863
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,720
all right um i hope you've enjoyed this

864
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,360
if there are questions then i think stu

865
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,679
is asking for them now

866
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,480
do donate to the isolation con

867
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,360
fundraiser for doctors without borders

868
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,039
and get in touch if you have any

869
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,440
questions

870
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,359
thank you james awesome stuff um yeah

871
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,239
any questions on

872
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,000
on twitch just fire them over um we've

873
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,760
got a bit of time

874
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,000
um yeah and personally james i mean i

875
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,679
find the the whole metrics thing within

876
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,399
security

877
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,280
um actually very difficult because it's

878
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,239
knowing what

879
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,520
what's valuable and who are they

880
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,239
valuable to um

881
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,599
especially as you start to feed things

882
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,918
further up the chain it becomes less

883
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,040
about well

884
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,079
you have to be careful with a lot of

885
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,599
metrics because they can be perceived in

886
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,960
a certain way that's very different to

887
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,879
what a security team would um

888
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,159
would value yeah it's um i mean that's

889
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,960
the reason i

890
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,839
stole this methodology from medical

891
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,520
because they deal with the same issues

892
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,560
around metrics

893
00:34:50,560 --> 00:35:02,160
and it does work on testing systems

894
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,000
else for q a well we've got james here

895
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,480
just a reminder i think all the talks

896
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,359
will be

897
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,359
oh there we go yep how do you approach

898
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,119
the challenge of discrepancies between

899
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,480
tool categorization

900
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,760
or rating uh ground truth

901
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,000
take ground truth and say this is the

902
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,760
thing i'm testing against no matter what

903
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,800
the tool

904
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,599
so you might want a different one at

905
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,240
different

906
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,520
life cycle stages so you might want

907
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,040
a if if you're looking more at we want

908
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,440
to assess pen testers or a pen testing

909
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,079
tool

910
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,520
you'll be looking more at a catch of the

911
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
flag type scenario where you've built a

912
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,520
system deliberately vulnerable

913
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
if you're looking earlier on you could

914
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,359
even take something like the owasp top

915
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,520
10 and say that's our ground truth

916
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
we will put some of these into the

917
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,119
design

918
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,440
and then test all of our tools against

919
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,200
this defined and known sample

920
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,599
other than that the problem is

921
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,320
discrepancies will always happen but

922
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,119
if you've got a good sample that you are

923
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,720
willing to say i will not question it

924
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
you can assess any tool that can be

925
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,319
applied to that sample in the same way

926
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,160
if that makes sense which hopefully it

927
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,560
does let me know if it doesn't

928
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,320
i'll try to rephrase

929
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,839
good

930
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
in medicine gra ground truth is tr is

931
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,040
highly questionable but doctors are gods

932
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,720
who are the gods of cyber security

933
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,640
ground through

934
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,839
that's a whole talk it depends on

935
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,839
depends on the stage in the life cycle

936
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,520
so

937
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
at the beginning when you're at design

938
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,359
usually there aren't any or at least a

939
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,960
lot of places i've worked there aren't

940
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,520
any

941
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,320
some places they do bring in security

942
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,599
people to look at design and

943
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,560
architecture

944
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,040
in which case the gods of cyber security

945
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,480
ground truth at that stage

946
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,800
are those security architects who are

947
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
doing threat modelling and assessing

948
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,160
against it

949
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,599
later on usually the gods of ground

950
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,160
truth

951
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,560
are your assessment tools which is where

952
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,839
a problem comes in

953
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,720
and really what you need is people to

954
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,880
double check those assessments to get a

955
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,000
ground truth you

956
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,359
you can't just rely on at all because

957
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,960
there will be false positives there will

958
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
be false negatives you will still have

959
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,680
those

960
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,680
if you have people check them over but

961
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,960
you reduce the number

962
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,640
and then you can take that as your truth

963
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,759
to assess other tools

964
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,400
yep cool

965
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,560
any more for any more on twitch i think

966
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,480
there's one being typed out

967
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,280
by the looks of it

968
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,839
okay

969
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,800
there's a known problem if you allow

970
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,480
ground truth to be very during the

971
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,000
process in medicine that's a real issue

972
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,920
how might one prevent that in cyber

973
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,480
you simply don't allow it to be varied

974
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,160
um

975
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,240
depending on where you are you could say

976
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,920
okay we've discovered our ground truth

977
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,200
was fundamentally wrong

978
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,359
we'll start the assessment over

979
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,720
otherwise

980
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,760
you're not dealing with people having

981
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,880
their lives at risk

982
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,000
and any assessment that you do

983
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,280
is going to be better than the metrics

984
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,800
we have at the moment for these sorts of

985
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,000
tools which are

986
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,200
largely yes we promise our tool is the

987
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,880
best one you'll find

988
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,040
uh best in market best in breed we've

989
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,960
been around for longest

990
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,400
right okay so this is

991
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,359
here for those who can't see it so what

992
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,200
about normalizing to measure uncertainty

993
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,119
across the sum total of the life cycle

994
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,800
with tools reporting different ratings

995
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,400
or even categories

996
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,599
yep i was thinking about talking more

997
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,359
about the uncertainty and about

998
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,520
weighting of ground truth and how you

999
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,880
could work with that

1000
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,359
and then i've realized that i want to

1001
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,400
save that for

1002
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,720
if i ever go back to university to go

1003
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,640
for my doctorate because we're then

1004
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,079
getting away from

1005
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,119
a simple a simplistic measure which

1006
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,240
gives us a number

1007
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,599
into fischer probabilities i can see

1008
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,280
ways it could work because you could

1009
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,079
weight your ground

1010
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,720
truth and bring that into the weighting

1011
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,119
of your results and how you get a rating

1012
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,320
at the end

1013
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,440
but it's going to be

1014
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,160
let's let's say a headache to work out

1015
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
all of the maths behind that and i would

1016
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,920
need a refresh course from

1017
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,040
someone in mathematics to start with so

1018
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,720
hopefully that answers the question as

1019
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
best i can if anyone wants to fund me

1020
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,280
for a phd into measuring uncertainty in

1021
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,119
different cyber security tools across

1022
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,760
the sum

1023
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,480
total of the development life cycle i'm

1024
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,400
more than happy to talk to you

1025
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,880

1026
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:25,839
and really useful

1027
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,280

1028
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,040

the one who actually set me off on this

1033
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,359
track because he

1034
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,520
worked in medical technology and started

1035
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,079
the whole conversation about using uh

1036
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,960
