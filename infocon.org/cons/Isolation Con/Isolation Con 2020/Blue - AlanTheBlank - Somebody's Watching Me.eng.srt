from this talk well you'll learn a bit

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,040
about my journey

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
into college and my journey into ocean

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
and i'm also going to give a little bit

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,320
of beginner's guide into ocean because i

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,520
feel

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,520
there's kind of that step missing

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,159
in industry how do you start doing this

41
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,200
and

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,960
what's the uh easiest uh what's the

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
best tips you could give for beginners

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,240
first of all

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,399
how did i get here why how did i start

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,320
into infosec

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,200
well surprisingly cyber security wasn't

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,159
my first choice when it comes to college

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,840
now what do i mean by that well in

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,960
ireland we use what's known as the cio

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,840
or central

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,479
applications office and what that does

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,720
it's a non-profit organization who

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,758
handles

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,200
college applications and they're

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,040
coming under a lot of scrutiny right now

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,120
with the uncertainty of

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,319
the leaving search examinations which

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,800
determine the points you get for going

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
into college

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,760
um with the uncertainty of leaving cert

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,000
it's

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
doing a whole number on the leaving cert

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,959
students and

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,560
there's a lot of questions being asked

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,239
as to how they would be

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,599
protected and are they

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,360
you know i already got a struggle trying

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,519
to get into college now

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,519
but go back to my first points cyber

71
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,760
security wasn't my first choice when it

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,000
came

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,040
to the cio right for those

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,160
unfamiliar with it you list your college

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,200
preferences from one to ten and

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
my first option was actually computer

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,159
applications in dcu

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,360
and second was computer science and

79
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,640
software engineering

80
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,680
at minute university in fact

81
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
the course that i'm in uh when i

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,239
originally filled out the cio

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,760
was my tent choice it was not my first

84
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
choice whatsoever nor wasn't my second

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,519
it was all the way down at the bottom of

86
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,239
the list and that was digital forensics

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,760
and cyber security at

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,040
itb now thankfully i did change that

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,080
in the change of mind uh for the cio and

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,959
bums that opened

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,920
third but that just goes to show you

92
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,560
know if

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,200
you're an irish student looking at this

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,920
and you're

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
worried that you're not gonna get what

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,280
you want

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
sometimes what you get is what you

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,319
actually want

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
um because i probably would have dropped

100
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,840
out of those

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
first two courses like how i kind of

102
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,760
wanted to

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,360
drop out of the course that i got into

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,480
at start because it wasn't what i

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,920
expected whatsoever

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,959
i got dropped into a general first two

107
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,560
years

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,319
and they were the most boring two years

109
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,238
of my life it was now i asked for it all

110
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,000
i joined the course to do cyber security

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
and not to learn how to use java for

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
the 10th time that and i was that way

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
until i got to clubs and societies sign

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,720
up day

115
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
in the college and i would call it like

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
it was yesterday right

117
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,759
we were all herded into a hall

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
and societies had set up their tables

119
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
and there was this

120
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,000
big crowd around the table

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
and when i went over to examine why they

122
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,120
had

123
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,160
handcuffs on the table and

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
if you got too close you'd end up

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,360
pankoff to the table

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,040
and from lockpick that was

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,520
the best feeling ever when you had to

128
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,960
pick the lock

129
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,199
and that was a society called hackersuck

130
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,759
who i have been a part of since then and

131
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,080
it's really helped me

132
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,120
stay into college

133
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,080
so that's that's how i got into college

134
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,479
then

135
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,560
years have passed i've made friends my

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
friends online

137
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,560
joined the many hats club and then one

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,280
day

139
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,479
stuff started to get real

140
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,520
so i received dm from a person

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
that a suspicious message had been

142
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
posted on a discord server

143
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,840
i won't go into details for sake of

144
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,479
privacy

145
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,520
for me and a group of people we then

146
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,039
gathered information on this on the

147
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,800
server that they posted and that

148
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,120
information was then relayed

149
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
to the authorities then

150
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,440
about two weeks after the fact

151
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,639
we got a report from someone else

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,840
uh unrelated that a kid had been

153
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,639
arrested in the state that they had

154
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,080
posted the message in

155
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
with a gun in their backpack now

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
to this day i do not know if that was

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
relating to the information that we had

158
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
given

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
but i like to think that it might be but

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,520
as i mentioned at start um

161
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
i am part of the olsen team for the many

162
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
hats club

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,440
and we took part in trace labs ctf last

164
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,479
week

165
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,039
and that is one thing that i've been

166
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,440
loving doing the past while

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,360
i was originally selected for the team

168
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,000
back in january of last year however due

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,319
to

170
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,360
family commitments i was unable to

171
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,880
participate i've now gone on to

172
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
win three times in a row and this is

173
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,000
actually where i

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,440
learned i learned about ocean for good

175
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,720
and that is the likes of badass army

176
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
and instant lives foundation trace

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,080
labs you know all those organizations to

178
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,120
use ocean for the good of people instead

179
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,919
of

180
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,520
the bad but as i did promise that start

181
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,639
of the talk

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,680
uh i will be talking about how to get

183
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,520
into us and how i

184
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
got into houston so one of the

185
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,960
basically classrooms mentor uh cyber

186
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
fighting

187
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,280
uh i stupidly asked for him to

188
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,039
uh do a little have a little bit of fun

189
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,160
right so this was a picture

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,360
that me cyber fighting and a couple of

191
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,080
other people

192
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,759
took that's me circled red and that is a

193
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,560
trainee bear

194
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
in dublin which we took with a webcam

195
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,840
that is probably available um

196
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,879
and there's me then walking later

197
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,599
uh down by the gpo in ocon street

198
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,319
all right now this went on for a couple

199
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,360
weeks he was trying to

200
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,599
figure out where i lived right

201
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,479
here he's then tracking me going through

202
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,199
blanchett's town

203
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,840
now i love this one right this picture

204
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,400
is captioned he still doesn't know

205
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
i knew because he fell over a stand

206
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,280
like a minute before taking this photo

207
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,199
so uh yeah i knew he was following me

208
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,399
then and uh

209
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,719
i was actually leading him down some

210
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,200
interesting aisles

211
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
and uh ultimately he then got the bus

212
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,640
route that i was on

213
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,599
and uh he managed to get a good idea as

214
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,839
to where i lived

215
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,800
uh so what can be done to remedy this

216
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,600
well

217
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,760
i would say you could have good opsec

218
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,959
but

219
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
sure it doesn't matter how good your

220
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,399
optic is there's always going to be

221
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,959
other people taking photos

222
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,680
um so cyber fighting will actually be

223
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,640
talking a bit more

224
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,279
about that side in his talk on the red

225
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,000
track

226
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,360
uh tonight so

227
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,959
that's the ocean for beginners where

228
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,720
would i suggest

229
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
starting off well there's three

230
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,279
main parts that i like to talk about

231
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:19,760
about

232
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
alcent for beginners that's google

233
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
docking

234
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
enumeration angio and or imminent

235
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,560
uh joint is uh geophysical

236
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,519
intelligence and imminent is image

237
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,600
intelligence

238
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,040
right so first of all let's talk about

239
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,720
google docking

240
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
it's easy and if you try it be

241
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,040
very very powerful so

242
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,839
i gave my information at start because

243
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,760
what's the best person to use

244
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,959
for uh examples other than yourself

245
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,200
because you give yourself consent

246
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,680
and if you use in title on the blank

247
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,320
you'll find

248
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,040
my name you'll find that i'm irish by my

249
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,880
youtube channel

250
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
and you'll find my college very fast so

251
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,640
that's why i gave that information

252
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,440
upstairs as opposed to self-doxxing

253
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
myself

254
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,640
and this is powerful uh when

255
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,040
doing a wind down from the trace lab ctf

256
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,600
which we've done past few times we've

257
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,279
had people come onto the server for a

258
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,560
little wind down just

259
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,880
chats strategies

260
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
we always mention well did you try

261
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
google dorking that

262
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,040
they always say no

263
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,160
but you know you couldn't guess you can

264
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,959
actually

265
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,399
pivot off of a google doc two family

266
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
through weird ways but you know nine

267
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,839
times out of 10

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,279
it does work and then

269
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,000
you also have enumeration now

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,880
enumeration

271
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,519
is getting more information basically

272
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,040
it's handy

273
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,320
uh it can be automated now this is tool

274
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,360
that i'd recommend

275
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
for enumerating uh profiles under a

276
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
certain username

277
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,720
that's called sherlock and what that

278
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
does it makes it into a lovely

279
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,560
little handy uh list

280
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,200
so again i use my own information here

281
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
because it's easiest to get

282
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,399
uh consent off of now here you see

283
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,839
all the list of profiles that i have

284
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,839
and again you can access this these are

285
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,839
live uh please don't hack

286
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,040
no hacky um

287
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
but yeah you can get a lot of

288
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,120
information off of

289
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
doing enumeration because from this you

290
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,720
can

291
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,720
tell i like anime i play chess

292
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,760
i at one point played fortnite that's a

293
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,200
new one

294
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,000
uh roblox false positive which is

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,120
happens a lot you offer spotify

296
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,000
you can tell a lot from a person's

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
online presence

298
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,040
and again this is something that people

299
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,320
really really don't think about now it

300
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,279
can be

301
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,680
the make all or break all of a

302
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,560
search when it comes to trace clubs

303
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,399
because again it's more profiles

304
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,720
it could be a weaker uh process

305
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,320
based profile you know you could have an

306
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,800
address you could have a phone number

307
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,399
that phone number could still be active

308
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,519
it could be doing

309
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
pinging off stuff you never know

310
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
and that is why you should always just

311
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,320
find profiles uh run the likes of

312
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,959
sherlock

313
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,120
enumerate all the profiles that you can

314
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,079
then manually check

315
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,360
and see if they are actually belonging

316
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,959
to the people

317
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,000
and lastly uh joe and

318
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,519
so when searching this it was hard to

319
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,240
find a good example

320
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
and i kind of made my own example here

321
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,680
at the end through

322
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,120
the help of uh people on twitter

323
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,720
uh so the cia

324
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,079
uh basically summarized geoand as

325
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,279
where am i what are natural man made

326
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,519
and what does this place look like now

327
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,800
fear after an event

328
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
a date but not specific about events so

329
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,160
i am worried what that means

330
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,320
and uh you know what what's the talk

331
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
without a

332
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,880
little bit of a uh example

333
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,839
so one more foot road let's do one last

334
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,120
example

335
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,839
and twitter is a great place for these

336
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,160
examples right

337
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,000
if you search that hashtag ocean

338
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
nine times out of ten you're gonna get

339
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,399
someone posting an awesome challenge

340
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
and this was a interesting one this had

341
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,839
been the first one i'd done in

342
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,519
a while so i was a little bit rusty

343
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,279
going into it

344
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,800
and really uh i had

345
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,880
thought this might be london but i don't

346
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,959
know london at all so i had to

347
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,760
do a little bit of work and eventually

348
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,040
join comes into in the end right

349
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,000
so going through his twitter to try and

350
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,480
find

351
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,880
information we find this

352
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,920
a lovely site while walking to work at

353
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,600
well i've redacted it but it's up there

354
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,839
um so we get information from this right

355
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,519
he's walking to work and

356
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
um he's crossing what turns out to be

357
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
the tower bridge in london

358
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
first of all i should probably verify

359
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
that here i am

360
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,240
at a place i'm trying to figure out what

361
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
way it is because again

362
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,480
i don't know london and

363
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,920
he turns out is going northbound

364
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,120
to london

365
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,480
or london so going back to

366
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,160
our original photo we need to pick out

367
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,199
key points here

368
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,040
to help search so we clearly have

369
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,079
a restaurant it's

370
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,560
an interesting corner building and

371
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,720
there's huge balconies

372
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,000
right uh

373
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
from the style of building

374
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,120
from the light on the buildings even

375
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,519
we can tell that it's

376
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,720
later in the day by the

377
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,000
shadows we can see the building further

378
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,720
in the back

379
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,399
is lit up as opposed to the building in

380
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,199
the foreground so the sun's not above

381
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,320
so it is a afternoon picture which means

382
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,800
we're

383
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,480
heading southbound and just searching

384
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,120
about

385
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,959
until we find a building that matches it

386
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,639
uh we end up going to duchess walk

387
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,199
i find a restaurant called by chloe

388
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:11,920
which

389
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,720
might be that restaurant that we see

390
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,079
there

391
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,480
and uh we can kind of make out the

392
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,680
sharp corner that we have in

393
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,680
our in the right of the image

394
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,199
here we have the balconies

395
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,320
that are prominent on our left and of

396
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,279
course the best way to find out is to go

397
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,399
online and verify so we jumped down

398
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,800
in google maps and that was the exact

399
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,560
location as to where that picture was

400
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,399
taken

401
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,320
so to summarize on that um

402
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
you know if you're looking to get into

403
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,279
else and the best way to do it is

404
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,720
through these twitter challenges

405
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,639
you build up a collection of

406
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,199
methodologies you build up a collection

407
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,959
of tools

408
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,720
you learn some tools work better than

409
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
other tools

410
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,359
also learn how to do a bit of uh jiowind

411
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,640
and imminent um

412
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,039
but for further resources

413
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,280
i've got i would recommend these three

414
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,000
links for resources

415
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,720
so the first one is relating to google

416
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,319
docking

417
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,440
uh the second one is a fantastic

418
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,640
course by robert falker

419
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
he actually has three intelligent

420
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,240
intelligence analysts certifications

421
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,640
i've done the first one myself but uh

422
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,360
unfortunately

423
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
since the time of me doing it and this

424
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,720
talk happening

425
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,080
he hasn't uh put on a cost i think it's

426
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,280
twenty dollars for the for the course

427
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,799
but it's a great course there are

428
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,880
three of them all together though and uh

429
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
there's another course that i would

430
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,720
highly recommend it's the

431
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,080
best seller according to udemy uh by

432
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,840
dean oh and it is a awesome

433
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,039
uh course from beginner to advanced

434
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
uh i reached out to him and he

435
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,160
thankfully gave

436
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,280
a coupon code as you can see in the

437
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,720
uh link there which will be

438
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,840
available on request or i'll

439
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,919
leave it up for a few more seconds for

440
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,640
someone to screenshot it

441
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,880
and that coupon code will bring it down

442
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,360
to 35 dollars instead of 250

443
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,679
so before i go into questions which

444
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,679
if people do have questions to leave

445
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,440
them in the

446
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,720
twitch chat um

447
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
yep to get into also really just

448
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,760
practice practice practice

449
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,200
know you can't do more than practice

450
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
and and so i lost my train of thought

451
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,799
there

452
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,840
and yeah you're good you're doing great

453
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
thanks

454
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,720
um yeah

455
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,280
so is there any questions

456
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,120
so i've got a quick question for you go

457
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
on um

458
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,840
when we did back on one we had um viking

459
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,480
and rag

460
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,240
on doing a talk about ocean yeah and

461
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
i asked the question to them and i'm

462
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,919
gonna ask it to you which was

463
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,840
a lot of people see ocean is possibly

464
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,919
incredibly invasive and it's about

465
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,840
nicking things from cameras and all that

466
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,440
kind of stuff

467
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
what are the positive applications of it

468
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,799
in your head alan

469
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,080
um how can we turn this idea that things

470
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
are invasive and intrusive

471
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,520
into something good so we do have

472
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
the ocean for good initiative where we

473
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,520
do see the likes of instant

474
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,360
uh isn't life foundation and badass army

475
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,320
who

476
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,200
held against uh who help take down

477
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,559
revenge porn

478
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,039
and we also have the likes of trace labs

479
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:11,919
who

480
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,440
use this ocean uh the information

481
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,240
given by people online readily available

482
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
for anyone to look up

483
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,360
um and they do use that information for

484
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
good

485
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,919
yeah i don't know if that really answers

486
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,039
your question

487
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,120
i think it does i think a lot of people

488
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,360
see a cctv camera and assume

489
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
the the man is watching me and all that

490
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,080
kind of stuff but i i heard a tale about

491
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,120
um somebody preventing suicide

492
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,320
actually because yeah we're able to

493
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,480
watch an individual sat on a bridge that

494
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,640
was presumably contemplating killing

495
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,520
themselves and

496
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,840
managed to prevent it happening which is

497
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
kind of amazing

498
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,559
yeah i heard of that one actually uh but

499
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,520
like

500
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,880
cctv cameras generally tend to be open

501
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
so we'll go back um

502
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,919
where is it just

503
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,080
hold on for a second yeah cctv cameras

504
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,880
tend to be open

505
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,559
and leads to brilliant shots like this

506
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,600
where we got a group photo

507
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
down the busy street of temple bear and

508
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,440
we were just standing there for

509
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,120
like a minute waiting for the camera to

510
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
catch up and

511
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,320
yeah it's one of the funnier pictures to

512
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,720
show

513
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,840
people and you know

514
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,480
as i said cctv cameras tend to be open

515
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,280
and i think that's more of the case for

516
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,760
the

517
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,520
sake of other people kind of

518
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,080
crowdsourcing

519
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,120
security yeah yeah

520
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,960
i'm gonna try and get through a few

521
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,640
questions here so what are your best

522
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,559
resources for learning oceans i think

523
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,159
you probably you put a few links in

524
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:56,799
there anyway

525
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,960
yeah and there's another one that i

526
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,559
didn't put in but that would be

527
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,159
sourcing doc games

528
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,280
and that is one of the better ones that

529
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,039
i have

530
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,360
been told um

531
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,480
so it's basically a simulated

532
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,080
ocean environment you'll be given

533
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
the headers of dodgy emails

534
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,760
i'm told to find out where this came

535
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,679
from

536
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,880
it's a really great simulation uh

537
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,360
of uh doing elsand or you'll be given

538
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,640
uh dummy github accounts i'm told get to

539
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,000
pass for the email used to register for

540
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,720
this

541
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,480
uh get account yeah not fair enough

542
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
i guess uh matt lebron came up with a

543
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,679
secondary question which

544
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,200
was around tooling um is it google

545
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,799
docking is it

546
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,640
showdown is it you know finding cameras

547
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
that are online that you can easily get

548
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
access to

549
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,039
what works for you uh well

550
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,080
sheldon's pretty interesting uh when

551
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,240
you use it because you can filter

552
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,120
specifically for webcams

553
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,360
and um you know if you're trying to find

554
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,480
webcams

555
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,799
uh sheldon would be the easier way to do

556
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,919
it

557
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,280
but if you're so you can find a ton

558
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,520
of them in ireland but if you're using

559
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
sheldon for these you really only find

560
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,960
churches

561
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,480
where most of dublin

562
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,679
uh is actually openly available

563
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,159
uh but churches and i think i've seen

564
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,360
like a firm or two

565
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,640
which you know it doesn't help the

566
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,960
stereotype but yeah

567
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,440
that's what i've been seeing but you do

568
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,200
live in a fairly gentle country

569
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,840
uh which is mostly country to be fair

570
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,679
yeah well i'm surprised that uh

571
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,000
my sims so smooth because i'm actually

572
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,039
in a rural

573
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,320
part of the country right now i'm

574
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,760
actually surprised i have smooth

575
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,520
connection

576
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,919
so let's see about a couple more

577
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,279
questions let's see what we've got

578
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,360
right oh here's one i like this one um

579
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,080
is multigo worth doing

580
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,360
um personally no okay

581
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,840
um it's great

582
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,000
for large uh investigations if you're

583
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,360
in a trailer organization it'd be

584
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,480
absolutely great but i

585
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,080
reckon did have an in-house version of

586
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
multi ago

587
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
unless you're doing a large

588
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,520
investigation which spans off into about

589
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,799
10 people i would not recommend it just

590
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,919
adds to make it over complicated

591
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,200
um but it could

592
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,799
uh people's mileage fairies uh people

593
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,360
may

594
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,720
find it better to visualize the data but

595
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,279
i've used it before and i was not a huge

596
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,480
fan

597
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,760
of it okay yeah fair enough right we are

598
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,360

604
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,360
