00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,520
introduced

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,760
um and i just want to kind of um start

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,040
off by mentioning

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,240
a um initiative that a lot of the cyber

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,799
people

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,960
have got involved in i think is really

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
key and hopefully some of you will be

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,920
really interested in

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,960
so myself dan and rad

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
started the cyber volunteers 19 um and

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,920
this was purely set up

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,200
really to help healthcare providers to

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
um stay more secure during this time and

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,799
hopefully um help them defend their

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,640
hospitals against cyber attacks because

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
obviously at the moment they're super

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,040
busy

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
and they're trying to save lives so we

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,240
wanted to help them

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,159
so we put together a team we've got

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,680
slightly just over 3

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,439
000 volunteers now so it's really

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,119
awesome um

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,799
and we've got some other team members as

43
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,360
well who are running some of the teams

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
so we have ian murphy who is also on

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,720
this panel funnily enough

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,719
um and ian is running the threat

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,000
intelligence team

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
so if any of you are interested in

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
getting involved in providing threat

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
intelligence to hospitals um

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
around europe um he is your guy because

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,600
he runs that team

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,840
jessica barker from sygenta which some

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
of you will know as well

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,959
she is in charge of running the

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,879
awareness team um and they've put

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,640
together some really awesome awareness

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,760
campaigns that are going to be

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,280
translated into seven different

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,000
languages

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,640
and sent out around europe to help

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
hospitals raise awareness with some of

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
their staff because one of the things we

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,280
were seeing a lot of

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,360
was hospitals having consultants who

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
were doing their consultancy sessions

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,840
and in these sessions the um the

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,040
consultants would use

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,599
zoom or whatever application they wanted

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,800
and they would also

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
be using their own personal google docs

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
folders to upload patient test

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
reports and stuff like that and share

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,280
those with patients

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,760
so um you know some of this awareness is

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
really key because what they've tried to

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,519
do is just make things work as opposed

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:53,920
to

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,560
actually thinking about security and

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,239
then we have jake moore and becky

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:58,959
pinkard

82
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,959
who are responsible for volunteer

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,120
management and they do an amazing job

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,879
monitoring and

85
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,720
managing the linkedin group where all of

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
our volunteers

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,720
apply to join the group um and to just

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,840
give you a bit of a

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,599
an idea of where we actually are

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,840
operating so we are operating in all of

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,159
these countries which is crazy um we've

92
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,760
actually just taken on some

93
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,920
hospitals in petersburg and moscow which

94
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
is really interesting as well

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
um and we just kind of had a discussion

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,519
about it and thought you know

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,120
actually politics doesn't really come

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,879
into it at this point in time it's about

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,360
saving lives and helping people

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
so we were really keen just to to help

101
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
as many countries as possible

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,440
so our threat report every single week

103
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
gets translated into all of these

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,000
languages

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,159
and sent out to hospitals in all of

106
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,280
these countries

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
to help them stay more secure which is

108
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,720
a really awesome um really awesome

109
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,239
outcome really

110
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,360
but that's not what we're here to talk

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
about today here is

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,959
uh we're talking about the hat to hack

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
debate which i decided to put together

114
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,599
because

115
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,239
some of you may know this but um i was a

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,280
lawyer

117
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
and i know i know i'm sorry and um when

118
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:06,720
i was

119
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,319
studying law one of the things we used

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
to do an awful lot of was something

121
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,159
called

122
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,360
mooting which is essentially debating

123
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
um and it would have like an issue

124
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,199
something that was kind of topical

125
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
and people would take the agree or

126
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
disagree side and have to argue it

127
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,040
and i think one of the things that was

128
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,720
really good and that's often missing in

129
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,759
conferences

130
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,800
when we have panel discussions is

131
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
that actually everyone takes the same

132
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,720
side and if a becomes a bit boring

133
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,639
and b i don't think it really moves our

134
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,560
thinking on and our knowledge on

135
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,520
so i thought that it would be really fun

136
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,240
to do

137
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
a debate instead of a normal panel

138
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,440
discussion

139
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,040
um and one of the things i love about

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,960
debating is that it's actually kind of

141
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,600
really

142
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,080
competitive as well so when i used to do

143
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,600
a lot of mooting when i was in law

144
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,320
school

145
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,759
you used to try and sort of um i guess

146
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,919
sort of apprehend what your opponents

147
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:58,960
would be saying

148
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,800
and if you would get to go first you'd

149
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
say well you know

150
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,000
you'll all hear from my right honourable

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
colleague he'll claim that

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,639
dot dot and you'd instantly dismiss

153
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,759
everything you thought they were going

154
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,800
to argue

155
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,639
and it was sort of great fun so i

156
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,840
thought it would be really interesting

157
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,919
to try that in the infosec world which

158
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,919
is what we're going to do today

159
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,919
um and a lot of the sort of things i

160
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,759
know about social engineering have

161
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,960
really come from my experience in law

162
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
because actually when you think about

163
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,440
lawyers you have to build rapport

164
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
really fast with judges with juries

165
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
that's incredibly important that they

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,479
like you because if the jury don't like

167
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,320
you there's absolutely no hope

168
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
that you are going to be successful

169
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,560
you've also got to make sure that your

170
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,880
arguments are really persuasive which is

171
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,639
another thing that social engineers have

172
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,160
to do as well

173
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,120
and finally you have to dress in a

174
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,160
certain way

175
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,080
you have to appeal to your audience so

176
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,919
they think that you're someone who can

177
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,720
be trusted

178
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,160
instantly so for instance um

179
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
i was once working for a criminal

180
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
defense firm

181
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,479
and um we had a case where this

182
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,360
individual

183
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,160
was being tried for assault and we

184
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
wanted to try and argue in his defense

185
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
that the other gentleman who was one of

186
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
the key witnesses was incredibly

187
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,759
aggressive

188
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,639
and had basically attacked our client

189
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,960
and that's what led to the assault

190
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
but the problem we had was that on the

191
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
stand he was presented really really

192
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,240
well

193
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,319
and the prosecution were presenting him

194
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,720
as this calm collected individual

195
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
and he really wasn't looking like he was

196
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,759
aggressive

197
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,160
so my boss decided to take a bit of a

198
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
different approach

199
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039
and he turned around to me and i was a

200
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,080
young wide-eyed law student

201
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
and he said you know you're a short

202
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,199
blonde girl

203
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,919
you look a bit innocent go up there and

204
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,680
you're going to question him and i want

205
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,919
you to get everything he says wrong

206
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,759
and keep going and keep going and keep

207
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,000
going until he loses it

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
and i thought i don't know about this

209
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,039
i'm not sure this is going

210
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,400
work i'm not sure i'm gonna be able to

211
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
do it so i had to go and

212
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
yeah it didn't take very long and before

213
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
you know it this guy was slamming his

214
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
fists down on the table and

215
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,080
yelling at me and shouting abuse at me

216
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,520
and calling me all the names under the

217
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,960
sun and instantly

218
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
you could see the jury going yeah no i

219
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,120
agree agree with their argument he's

220
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,479
aggressive

221
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,160
so all of this is exactly like social

222
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,599
engineering and i think a lot of this

223
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,199
also comes into debating as you'll

224
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,680
probably see later on in this session

225
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,599
that the people who are on each team are

226
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,280
going to try and appeal

227
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
to you to try and win the argument

228
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639
um and we and you actually get to choose

229
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,720
the winners because on twitter if you

230
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,360
follow me on twitter lisa forte uk

231
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
you will see polls that will go live as

232
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
we debate each issue

233
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,440
and you can decide who you think should

234
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
be the winner

235
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,520
so law and debating i think is really

236
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,720
good and is why we need

237
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,039
to do more of it in conferences and

238
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,080
hopefully this will

239
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
inspire us to do it live on stage as

240
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
well which perhaps a little bit more

241
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,560
intimidating

242
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,960
um but we're gonna move on and i'm gonna

243
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,400
start introducing to you

244
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,319
some of the people so on team one

245
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,520
we have zoe and ian uh do we have zoe

246
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:13,919

248
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,039

249
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,360
zoe um just to introduce

250
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,840
zoe if you don't already know her she's

251
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,960
absolutely fabulous

252
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
so she's someone who i consider to be

253
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,039
one of the top-rated cyber security

254
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,479
specialists i honestly

255
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,599
do she's a cisco champion she has also

256
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,799
been named one of the top

257
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,599
50 women in tech and and this is

258
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,159
probably

259
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,919
the most amazing thing i think i've ever

260
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,279
read out about somebody

261
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,320
she appeared in vogue magazine i mean

262
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,560
that's amazing she's a great she's a

263
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,360
great speaker

264
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
and almost above all of that she's an

265
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
amazing ferret mum

266
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,480
she's got amazing ferrets and i follow

267
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,000
them on instagram and they bring a

268
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,720
little shred of happiness to my life

269
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,440
so zoe we've had a question for the

270
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,720
audience for you

271
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
um and they have asked what has been

272
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,000
hardest about being a successful woman

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
in tech

274
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
all right well that intro makes me sound

275
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
so much cooler than i am

276
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,040
so i'll just go with it but

277
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
i don't know being a woman tech well i

278
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
think the first thing is i tend to be a

279
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
bit cautious

280
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,800
about being called out or singled out as

281
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
a woman in tech

282
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
because honestly what tends to happen

283
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
is there's this perception that i speak

284
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,640
for all women

285
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,399
um i don't so be mindful

286
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,160
that um you know i my specific

287
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,519
experience does not

288
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,240
relate to everyone um but i have run

289
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
into issues where people seem to think

290
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,839
at my age my time in life my priorities

291
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,720
for work have

292
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,760
shifted to family duties um which i'm

293
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
sure you've had to hear

294
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,800
it before um i've been fact checked

295
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
to the point where i start to question

296
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
myself and

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,200
i struggle with this perception of when

298
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
i want to be authoritative

299
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
or i'm being too bossy or too too much

300
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,920
of a jerk

301
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,600
uh instead of you know being the boss um

302
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
i've also had this really awkward

303
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,279
situation

304
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,600
quite a few times where when i'm kind

305
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
it's taken as flaherty

306
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,200
so there is there is a lot of

307
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,120
perceptions that you do

308
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,800
kind of deal with and and re reiterating

309
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,360
that no

310
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,320
you know i do actually like working um

311
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
but i think there's this other

312
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,360
benefit that people don't don't

313
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,399
recognize and i think it was um i can't

314
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,079
remember who was i was talking to

315
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,200
but they basically said um

316
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,680
when when you're a woman in tech you

317
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,480
generally are

318
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,040
singled out as that but you can use that

319
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,480
to your advantage because

320
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
by default in the first start you know

321
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
you're you're unique to this room

322
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
and so you can use that platform to

323
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
stand out from your colleagues

324
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,000
and the cool thing is you might um

325
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,680
it might bring you to attention more

326
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,000
often the downside is there is that

327
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,600
you know that need to keep keep up

328
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
keep up with your image i suppose you

329
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,959
could say okay

330
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,959
so quick question just so people can get

331
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,720
a bit of a feel for you and it is sunday

332
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,839
evening so we've got to have a bit of

333
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,560
fun

334
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,120
which do you prefer out of these

335
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
squirrels or raccoons

336
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,200
uh oh gosh i think squares because

337
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
they're little

338
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,959
and really [ __ ] fast sorry okay

339
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,920
private yachts or private jets

340

352
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,120
remember from my introduction

353
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
one of our team leaders for the cyber

354
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
volunteers 19 initiative

355
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
leading the hospital flash intelligence

356
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,519
team there are rumors

357
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,000
most of which i started myself that he

358
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,440
is a failed footballer

359
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
a former model and was rumored to have

360
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,839
once dated paris hilton

361
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,839
so ian we have a question for you from

362
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,040
the audience as well

363
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,000
which says i love your linkedin videos

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,560
why did you start them

365
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
eagle

366
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,720
have a massive eagle uh no not

367
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
by the way the only thing i could model

368
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,399
a gloves and balaclavas anyway

369
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,440
um so so um

370
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,160
i i i've unfortunately been in this

371
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,560
industry over 25 years

372
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
and i hate i absolutely hate snake oil

373
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,920
sales people

374
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,800
and i think i've done it from that point

375
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,720
of view i think they harm our industry

376
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,760
more than

377
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,560
more than people who just don't patch it

378
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
more than people who just don't take

379
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,760
security seriously

380
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,240
i think the people who go out there to

381
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,519
make somebody think they get

382
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,600
more than actually getting or don't give

383
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
them the full story around what they are

384
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,519
actually getting and how hard it is to

385
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,320
do

386
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
i think they do our industry a real

387
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,839
disservice so

388
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,760
my goal in life is to call out those

389
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,279
bullshitters and i think that's what

390
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,720
linkedin is great for

391
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,200
pardon my french this may happen from

392
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
time to time

393
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,320
throughout this whole debate it will

394
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,480
pass you won't go home swearing at your

395
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,279
children

396
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,000
you might do but it'll pass we accept no

397
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,519
responsibility if you're sort of

398
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,120
radicalized after this

399
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,000
indeed i i will accept failed footballer

400
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
any rumors about palestine were probably

401
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,120
started by me

402
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,279
and modeling is probably

403
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,320
railway modelling and stuff like that

404
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
okay quick five questions for you apple

405
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,079
pie or chicken pie

406
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,680
apple pie facebook or twitter

407
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,800
twitter going to university or doing an

408
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,839
apprenticeship

409
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,399
do an apprenticeship would never change

410
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,519
doing it i

411
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,560
it taught me how to talk to peers

412
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,120
it taught me how to respect peers in a

413
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,079
way that i was one of their peers

414
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,000
coming from school and then going into a

415
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
working environment

416
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,720
with people who who are teaching you at

417
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,880
school demand respect

418
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
actually when you do an apprenticeship

419
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,000
you

420
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,199
find out you've got to earn that respect

421
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,000
and and and they beat it into you in the

422
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
most

423
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,560
the most inhumane ways i'm not i'm not

424
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
condoned and beaten

425
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,240
maybe a little bit i'm not condoning it

426
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,040
or

427
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
um i would never change i would never

428
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,880
change it for the world i did go to

429
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
university afterwards it was mainly to

430
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,160
fix their plumbing but i did go to

431
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
university afterwards

432
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
but um yeah apprenticeship every day a

433
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,680
week

434
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,240
awesome okay so that was team one who

435
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,880
you will hear

436
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,120
arguing uh together on various different

437
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,000
points

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
so next we have team two which are scott

439
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,120
and

440
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,000
kevin so we'll start with scott scott is

441
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
an educator

442
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,079
he has a focus on counter fraud public

443
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,880
safety

444
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,199
um and an awareness of cyber security

445
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,560
generally within the public

446
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,399
he's worked really closely with law

447
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,199
enforcement um and he has been on tv

448
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
a lot and he will probably say it wasn't

449
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
a lot and be a bit modest but it was a

450
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,760
lot i've seen it

451
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,399
um he's also convinced interestingly

452
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,399
that he can communicate with squirrels

453
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,000
we'll touch on that a bit later so scott

454
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
um we have a question for you from the

455
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,519
audience which is probably the nastiest

456
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,680
question of all of the ones that came in

457
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,639
oh here we go okay it says what was it

458
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,040
like

459
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,360
working with the police and how was it

460
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
different from the private sector

461
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,040
uh okay um that's a really good question

462
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
to start with uh so it was different i

463
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,920
went and i

464
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
kind of joined up to try and open doors

465
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,360
and kind of like

466
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,759
make make bridges but it seemed to burn

467
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,040
a lot of those bridges

468
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,920
recently um just realizing that policing

469
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
is so far behind and still stuck

470
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
in this 1950s idea of you know as versus

471
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,480
them and

472
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
you know there's old school oh but it's

473
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
kind of like the old boy network

474
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,959
everybody's friends

475
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,639
you only get further if you're friends

476
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
with you know the dcc or the acc or all

477
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,880
these other acronyms that people don't

478
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,519
understand

479
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,800
and they really it's kind of like the

480
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
tech community we're quite

481
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,600
uh self-facing we don't really tend to

482
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,000
look

483
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
outside and try and figure out what

484
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,279
other people are doing elsewhere

485
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,880
um and they're still stuck in that and i

486
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,279
think that's so it was

487
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,000
it was interesting it was really strange

488
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,720
i know

489
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,240
everybody well most people should know

490
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,000
your background so you kind of

491
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
came from the same environment and it's

492
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,800
really bizarre but at the same time

493
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,120
you can't really step away even if you

494
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,639
see a lot of crap going on you can't

495
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,839
really step away because you think

496
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,279
you're making a difference

497
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,720
so yeah yeah and i think the camaraderie

498
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,560
in the police at its best is way better

499
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,160
than it is in the private sector in my

500
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,720
personal

501
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,280
experience at least but um yeah i know

502
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,640
there's a lot of problems

503
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,199
anyway scott quick fire questions for

504
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:09,679
you

505
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,799
beer or wine beer obviously okay

506
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,000
quarantine or freedom

507
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,919
how do you seriously have to think about

508
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,679
that uh

509
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,280
i think everybody's expecting me to see

510
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,359
that so i'll go freedom

511
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,359
because everybody okay and at risk of

512
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,119
being shouted out by the next person

513
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,840
just eat or deliver or just eat

540
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
asked kevin how

541
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,559
um how did you

542
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,720
why did you get into becoming a cso and

543
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,400
how is it best to go about doing that

544
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,080
um money and fame um but i um

545
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,440
i just love what i do right so i love

546
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,080
doing scary stuff have done for more

547
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,600
years and i want to admit really

548
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,039
um i think there's loads of different

549
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,559
routes to doing it so you've got to love

550
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,760
it right so i think most jobs in

551
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,120
security you've pretty much got to love

552
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,840
what you do

553
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,000
because it is 24 7. it is stuff you

554
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,360
think about all the time

555
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
there are miscreants all over the place

556
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
trying to annoy things right so

557
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,000
um so you've got you've got to have

558
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,039
super passion for what you're doing and

559
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,559
kind of kind of love it i think

560
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,320
um and in terms of becoming the sea

561
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,919
sailors yeah there's there's technical

562
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,080
csos and non-technical csos and

563
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
seasons in banks and cities in kind of

564
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,679
companies like ours whatever else

565
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,720
there's a whole variety of different

566
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,360
types

567
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,320
so i think it's it's um just build your

568
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
career build your kind of network

569
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,080
um get stuck into a wide variety of

570
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,200
different things you're gonna do a lot

571
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,600
better

572
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,120
doing my kind of job if you've got a bit

573
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
of knowledge about lots of stuff so if

574
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
you're super hardcore in like one area

575
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,760
that you love

576
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,039
probably not quite as good as someone

577
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,640
who likes being a bit of all sorts of

578
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
things because i need to have that like

579
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,799
thin veneer of knowledge across things

580
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,919
rather than being kind of a super

581
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:34,960
explained one

582
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
and then i have a team of people who are

583
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
way better than me at the things they do

584
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,400
to make me look awesome and make us look

585
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,240
awesome

586
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,000
i think kim is like humming in the

587
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,760
background which i know that's

588
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,039
i don't know if you can see my camera

589
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,440
that's my little one so i also

590
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
anyone is on twitter i'm sitting with my

591
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,640
little four-year-old he's super cute

592
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,120
therefore we win and ian loses

593
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,360
sorry mate um oh whoa whoa whoa whoa

594
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
nobody tell me about that type of dirty

595
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,720
tip

596
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,840
i can bring in my favorites yes

597
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,240
this is like flying to slip from infosec

598
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,880
and just being

599
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,200
like who has the cutest stuff yeah my

600
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
daughter children and pets right let's

601
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,559
let's forget security

602
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,960
okay quick five questions for you then

603
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,320
dogs or cats

604
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,000
dogs good answer pasta or pizza

605
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,280
oh pizza maryland cookies or oreos

606
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,760
maybelline cookies so ridiculous

607
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,120
anyways okay so that's the intros done

608
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,880
um so just to give you an introduction

609
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
of what's going to happen each team are

610
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,640
going to get an opportunity to argue for

611
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
or against one of the statements that's

612
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
coming up um they will get

613
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,159
time to present their case and also

614
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,520
rebut the other side

615
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,919
i have posted the first question already

616
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,600
on twitter with a live poll

617
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,159
um so at least forte uk you can find

618
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,320
that and you can vote for who you think

619
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,280
should be the winner and tweet any

620
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
questions that you have for any of the

621
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,760
participants

622
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,440
straight to me through the dms so please

623
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,880
so they cannot see them because that

624
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
would be cheating

625
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,120
okay so our first um statement that they

626
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,799
will be arguing about

627
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,480
nothing should be considered out of

628
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,640
scope when it comes to pen tests and red

629
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,840
teaming tests

630
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,080
so zoe and ian will be agreeing with

631
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,880
this statement

632
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,039
and kevin and scott will be disagreeing

633
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,280
so over to you zoe and ian let's hear

634
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
what you've got

635
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,600
all right so uh ian do you want me to

636
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,120
pick up this part and then you'll pick

637
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,480
up the next one for a

638
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,799
person

639
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,440
um i would say nothing should be

640
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,960
considered out of scope

641
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,159
because the entire goal of it

642
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,280
is to identify prior to a malicious

643
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,159
actor

644
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,640
and you know what what's vulnerable

645
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,000
what's going to happen

646
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
what are they going to get access to so

647
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,919
if we if we say

648
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,760
uh actually that's that escape that kind

649
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,919
of defeats the entire purpose

650
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,840
and also if you do it in pieces it can

651
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,240
be

652
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,280
more real life but manageable

653
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,960
if that makes sense and you know i know

654
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
you have quite a few really good points

655
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,080
i'll let you take over

656
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,520
so you see if if we're not going to test

657
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,200
it who is going to test it

658
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,559
so if you're going to turn around and

659
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,720
say we can't do that it may fall over i

660
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,640
get the idea that i really do get the

661
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,159
idea that will probably form part of

662
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,440
scott and kev's

663
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,919
argument but the problem with that is if

664
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,200
somebody else

665
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,120
will test it for you and those people

666
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,799
who will test it for you won't be as

667
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,640
kind as the testers

668
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,480
so whilst i don't believe in maliciously

669
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,919
trying to bring stuff down

670
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,440
if you're not going to push and test

671
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,760
your defenses somebody else will

672
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,039
and for my money it takes a really brave

673
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,480
leader i'm a really confident security

674
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,240
professional which i know kevin is

675
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,720
therefore he can't argue against it

676
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,760
is to actually want to find it see what

677
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,880
i did there kev

678
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,120
want to find out where their weaknesses

679
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,679
are and plug those weaknesses because if

680
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,080
you're

681
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,400
coming at this with just a hey we've had

682
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,600
a scan or we had a

683
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,679
pen test last year and what did you do

684
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,640
about it not

685
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
much we just tipped a couple of boxes

686
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
and kind of moved on

687
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,480
if we can actually think more

688
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
proactively instead of passively sitting

689
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:12,799
there

690
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,480
and waiting for our pants to be pulled

691
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,559
down then we've got more of a chance of

692
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,480
staying out of the news and staying

693
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,000
safe stay safe people

694
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
so i think that the chat do you mind if

695
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,960
i jump in first scott

696
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
yeah and you go so the challenge of that

697
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,880
is you guys have taken a very narrow

698
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
view and you've already outscoped a

699
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,840
whole bunch of things in your heads

700
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
before you start talking about a scope

701
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,159
right

702
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,240
so how many red teams have you seen

703
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
where they kidnap the

704
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,480
chairman's children to get the password

705
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,000
that's out of scope

706
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,600
how many no i have seen that

707
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,080
before really right so you don't tend to

708
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,120
have in scope

709
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
things like muggings or you know you

710
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
don't crack passwords

711
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
you talk to passwords out of people do i

712
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,840
mean so you don't do any of that kind of

713
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,279
thing so i don't get your password by

714
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,159
mugging you do i

715
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,039
i just don't get your password from

716
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,110
[Laughter]

717
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,799
by default you've already had to narrow

718
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,600
the scope from

719
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,080
actual criminals to a red team exercise

720
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
that's within the acceptable parameters

721
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,640
of a contract right

722
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
you've kind of already done some of that

723
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,320
it's trish sorry i can see you trying to

724
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
dive in and you don't get to about till

725
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,720
we finished

726
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,520
okay sorry no i'm just teasing um so i

727
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,720
think you're always going to outscope

728
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,320
some things because of business damage

729
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,240
and limitations within the law right so

730
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,679
there's some things that aren't legal

731
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,039
that the criminals will do that you

732
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,960
won't do as a red team or a pen testing

733
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,799
you might do but you wouldn't get out to

734
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,000
so you're always going to ask

735
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,679
some of those and scott you want to kind

736
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,039
of come in with some more reasonable

737
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,400
points

738
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,679
yeah i mean i've gone straight to the

739
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,679
extreme now scotty said

740
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,080
mortar i know i was just thinking that

741
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
was it's kcd drug them and then just

742
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,640
beating with

743
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,559
five dollar wrench stuff but no that's

744
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,279
100 right that's exactly yeah but no

745
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,960
ian just to come back in something you

746
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
said you said uh

747
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
keep you out the news you know

748
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,919
everything's in scope i'll keep getting

749
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,279
the news what if

750
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,159
pentest happens to company companies

751
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,600
entire back end and entire

752
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,159
infrastructure

753
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,159
goes down for like two or three days i

754
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,679
think the recent one that i remember in

755
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,159
the last

756
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,559
couple of weeks is 118 money so that's a

757
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,159
full credit card provider

758
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,919
um other credit card providers are

759
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,760
available by the way but that's a full

760
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,200
credit card provider where people

761
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
couldn't access

762
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,760
their stuff they couldn't access their

763
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
money they couldn't pay their bills

764
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
now i'm not saying it was a red team it

765
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,039
was kind of like a a

766
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
pen test of sorts but let's say it was

767
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
just for the purposes this debate

768
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,559
that's a full credit card infrastructure

769
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,480
that's gone down for three or four days

770
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,960
it was in the news customers are pissed

771
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,480
off that they can't get access to

772
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,559
anything they can't do anything

773
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,720
so yeah i would say things like that

774
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,559
definitely you know that's why scoping

775
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,640
matters it matters not to bring down a

776
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
live infrastructure because you've no

777
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,440
idea the impact to that

778
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,600
and i'm gonna get that i really do get

779
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,640
that scott

780
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,960
it's it's a valid point however the

781
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
issue with that is that

782
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,240
there's a question to be asked is was it

783
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,200
a robust infrastructure in the first

784
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,679
place

785
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,360
if if uh red team testers or maybe even

786
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,400
if a scan

787
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
has brought that system down do they

788
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,159
have deeper problems other than that

789
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,720
and i'm not advocating to bring systems

790
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,159
down i'm really not

791
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,200
but when you think about it most attacks

792
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,559
happen through um fairly

793
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,279
innocuous genetic stuff that hasn't been

794
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,200
done for a very long time

795
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,679
and even when even when you do scope

796
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,640
that out and d

797
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,520
scope and point it out to them now going

798
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,880
back to the sql standard days hey you

799
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
should have passed

800
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
sql and then everyone caught a cold even

801
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
even when you point that stuff out to

802
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,320
them the issue is

803
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,640
people generally don't fix it and we're

804
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,080
getting to the point now where

805
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,679
people are taking the inf the 300 page

806
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,679
tenable scans that are given to them as

807
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,880
a pen test

808
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,480
right that's not all pen testers of

809
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,919
course i get that but

810
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,000
pen tests and hand over 20 grand thank

811
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,520
you very much and they're just putting

812
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,200
them in the bin because it's a tick box

813
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,240
exercise

814
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,760
so if we're not going to change our

815
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,520
approach to helping people

816
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,159
properly defend themselves you know the

817
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,200
definition of it

818
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
of of insanity is doing the same thing

819
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,799
we've always done but

820
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,799
i think that's a different point that's

821
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,120
that's are the outputs from pen tests

822
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,080
and red teams

823
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,520
useful and actionable to the company

824
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,360
that's paying for them that's not a

825
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,039
scope question that's basically saying

826
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,279
i would like to argue or like target

827
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,399
that nobody

828
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,039
nobody mentioned the fact that i said

829
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,440
done

830
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,720
in pieces say yes you can't

831
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,039
escape the entire infrastructure all at

832
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,799
once but you can

833
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,760
do it over time because at the end of

834
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
the day

835
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
at the end of the day appendix that's a

836
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,720
once

837
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,840
snapshot you yeah so you're saying

838
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
so you're saying by scoping multiple

839
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,799
tests you can get to a thorough test at

840
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,440
the end through multiple scope tests

841
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,960
come on i'm saying

842
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,210
[Laughter]

843
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,960
however just to back up what's always

844
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,320
saying she's not saying that you

845
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
actually scope a pen test and say don't

846
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
do the theory because that's a bit

847
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,200
she's what what we're saying is scope it

848
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,720
in pieces and you'll get to that

849
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,200
eventually you're saying a scope it

850
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,320
right in as you just said

851
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,080
i'm not saying you can't do that

852
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,399
ian we've had someone message in saying

853
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,159
for zoe and ian do they feel

854
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,640
that a test could be done within scope

855
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,880
however any potential gaps that are out

856
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,440
of scope

857
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,360
highlighted to the client with a view to

858
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,240
obtaining a new scope on the next test

859
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,880
so that's typically how i have to do

860
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,279
them

861
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,399
yes you don't you don't there is

862
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,600
typically there is an escape and

863
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,520
you do say this is was not done in this

864
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,039
test

865
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,039
potentially you could do that we haven't

866
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,720
touched on is budget right

867
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,399
so reality is my budget doesn't

868
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,320
necessarily allow me to have all of the

869
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
things tested all the time

870
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,200
so you have to do some scoping and

871
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,880
sizing of pen test because

872
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,640
it's not like it cost me 20 pounds a day

873
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,240
to have a tester testers working on my

874
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,000
site right

875
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,679
so there are also budgetary concerns

876
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,240
that would be brilliant um so i think

877
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,360
yes i would agree

878
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,559
budgets are a problem but i also would

879
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,120
say

880
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,240
that if you're not testing it because

881
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
and your reason is oh i don't have the

882
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,159
money i will also say

883
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,200
that well you know when it breaks and

884
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
it's in the media and your reputation is

885
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,840
ruined

886
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,159
you still won't have the money but you

887
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,279
can say that about everything right i

888
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:51,679
should

889
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,200
i should collect every single log i

890
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,320
should monitor everything i should have

891
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,159
threat intel i should have a large 24 7

892
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:56,640
team

893
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,000
i should patch everything i should have

894
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,200
a full inventor i should have filled

895
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,960
cmdb i should have everything right i

896
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,480
haven't got an infinite budget and no

897
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,159
business does so you have to

898
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,880
chop but you can play it you do but i

899
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,039
can't

900
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,399
[Laughter]

901
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,080
you do not collect logs right you don't

902
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,919
have to bull but you know i mean

903
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,279
you've got to prioritize things and you

904
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,120
can't just do offensive right i've got

905
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,720
to do some blue team as well as some red

906
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,039
team

907
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,880
i can't just have i've just spent my

908
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,480
entire budget on pen testing it but i

909
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,919
can't fix anything because i have no

910
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,399
money left

911
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
i'm gonna just draw a little line

912
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,000
underneath this

913
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,080
the votes are in from this particular

914
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,600
poll and the winner

915
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,000
is kevin and scott with fifth year

916
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,200
but only with 51 to 49 so

917
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,880
i'm with can we retire there and call it

918
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,320
a day i didn't even vote for myself

919
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,960
i don't even know how to vote are you

920
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,600
saying

921
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,039
i'm going to open up 17 i'm going to

922
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,480
open up 17 new twitter accounts now

923
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,840
okay so the next question companies

924
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,679
should always be responsible for the

925
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,440
actions of their employees during work

926
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:05,919
hours

927
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,440
even if they go rogue and steal data

928
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,360
so arguing in agreement with this

929
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,000
statement is zoe and ian and disagreeing

930
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,039
with this statement

931
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,159
are kevin and scott so over to you

932
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,840
zoe and ian oh so hard one

933
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,320
but we're going to agree on this one

934
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,120
right

935
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,559
so and and you did mention before lisa

936
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,559
about my failed football career so

937
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,960
it was a fit well you know i did play

938
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,000
football for a living

939
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,960
at a point and and all the best teams i

940
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,679
would ever

941
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,760
ever play for had a strength of

942
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,880
character

943
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,320
and whether we won or lose lot or lost

944
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,039
rather

945
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,000
we we took it in our stride and the

946
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,440
great managers and the great leaders

947
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,840
i've ever played for and worked for

948
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,440
would would take it as a personal

949
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,080
problem for them should should we lose

950
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
they would never single out a player

951
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,000
they would

952
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,679
never sit so you look at all the great

953
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,320
managers sir alex ferguson shanks

954
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,960
paisley

955
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,559
all of those guys you see i'm a

956
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,080
liverpool supporter but i do recognize

957
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,960
sir alex

958
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,240
is a great manager um is is that they

959
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,760
never single out their players they

960
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,000
never

961
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,320
single them out for criticism and and

962
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,360
actually

963
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,480
when you are part of an organization

964
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,320
that you know the leadership

965
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,039
has your back like that and you know

966
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:25,679
that

967
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,360
that you you start to behave responsibly

968
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,720
to those leaders so so companies

969
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,279
should always be responsible for their

970
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,279
employees when they do bad stuff but

971
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,720
also as well

972
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,679
uh uh congratulating those employees and

973
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,519
giving them the kudos when they do good

974
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,880
stuff as well there's a

975
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,200
there's a there's a flip side to this

976
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,080
you know the

977
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,880
the when whenever whenever something bad

978
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,640
happens or whenever i'm in a customer

979
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,320
and i'm talking to them about risk or

980
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,519
risk management

981
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,360
i always say to them that actually the

982
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,039
issue here isn't

983
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,440
isn't whether that one person did that

984
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
the rogue employee did that because

985
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,559
nobody remembers

986
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,960
the name of the person in the capital

987
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
one breach right they just know as the

988
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,559
capital one breach

989
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,679
so the issue here is that you have to

990
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,880
accept

991
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,399
when they're doing something on your

992
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,880
behalf either in your hours your office

993
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,960
hours or outside of your office hours

994
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,440
that they're your responsibility to your

995
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,399
employees

996
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,120
and you have to drill into them a sense

997
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,000
of belonging

998
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,399
and a sense of need and a sense of

999
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,240
togetherness and teamwork

1000
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,399
within your organization and that way

1001
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,080
you can reduce

1002
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,320
those those issues those things that may

1003
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,600
cause you embarrassment

1004
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,360
sorry zoe over to you no no that's fine

1005
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,519
um i was also going to bring up the uh

1006
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,960
the beeper i think it was deeper

1007
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,080
international

1008
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,279
and their instant that happened

1009
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,279
because again that was an internal uh

1010
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,480
rogue employee

1011
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,080
and they accessed a lot more data than

1012
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,720
they should

1013
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
and i believe it was they gave it to a

1014
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,399
third party or something

1015
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,080
um it was intentional um and naughty

1016
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,320
and again we remember rico we don't

1017
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,440
remember them

1018
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,040
because the court of public opinion

1019
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,480
doesn't really care

1020
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,440
if um it was the company's fault

1021
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,839
directly or if it was a rogue employee

1022
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,918
they're not going to stand on the side

1023
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,159
of a company being like it's not a fault

1024
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,800
um in reality it is actually their fault

1025
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,520
because they're

1026
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,199
giving access to the systems this data

1027
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,119
and they have to build it in a way that

1028
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,800
protects the user

1029
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,280
from intentional and unintentional

1030
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,239
actions

1031
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,839
as well as protects the company so i 100

1032
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,760
think that actually um even if

1033
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,199
you um it wasn't part of their job

1034
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,359
the whole point of the separation of

1035
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,280
duties the whole point of the principle

1036
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,719
of least privilege

1037
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,359
all of these things are built in a way

1038
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,000
to

1039
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,200
minimize misuse whether it's intentional

1040
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,000
or not

1041
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,760
so 100 the company is liable

1042
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,880
because when you go to court um for

1043
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,520
example

1044
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,640
uh or not sorry wrong words i'm thinking

1045
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,359
of lawyers

1046
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,680
um when you have to deal with a

1047
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,040
regulation

1048
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,920
issue and you report to the ico in the

1049
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,400
uk

1050
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,040
and the dpa or something i don't know

1051
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,000
what the terms are

1052
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
either way it's the other company that

1053
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,599
is liable

1054
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,520
okay so you you and ian are saying that

1055
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,200
you agree

1056
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,720
so you all know that the high court and

1057
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,880
the court of appeal held morrisons

1058
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
vicariously liable for their member of

1059
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,040
staff however that was overturned by the

1060
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,880
supreme court recently

1061
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,720
who said that on a point of law

1062
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,960
morrisons were not responsible for the

1063
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,520
action of that member of staff who stole

1064
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,839
uh data and put it onto his laptop so

1065
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,680
what you and zoe are arguing that in

1066
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,079
that case morrison should be liable

1067
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,480
following your reasoning is that correct

1068
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,640
i would say yes because

1069
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,359
even if the court didn't find or

1070
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,960
overturned it or whatever

1071
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,400
and the reality is the people that it

1072
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,599
affects

1073
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,480
don't really care it's still going to

1074
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,960
affect

1075
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,280
them regardless of who did it and it's

1076
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,520
still the reputation of the company

1077
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,440
i don't really care if a court says no

1078
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,119
you know it's not really a fault because

1079
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,240
at the end of the day i also know

1080
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,880
they made it available or configured it

1081
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,960
in

1082
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,760
and governments as well these companies

1083
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,640
and governments

1084
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,079
will get no votes because everyone will

1085
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,640
fall asleep

1086
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,920
they have a lovely voice it doesn't put

1087
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,680
people to sleep

1088
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,160
okay i have a comeback for all that so

1089
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,200
um

1090
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,079
just just one brief point like if we're

1091
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,920
looking at it in the basis of you know

1092
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,040
small company or

1093
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,880
even small-ish company or medium-sized

1094
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,079
company yeah

1095
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,520
you can kind of go right you should have

1096
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,040
vetted all your employees and it's clear

1097
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,640
when someone's sticking like a million

1098
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,200
usb

1099
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,280
drives whoever uses the usb drives now

1100
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,960
but they're sticking a million usb

1101
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,720
drives in and clearly dumping all the

1102
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,359
stuff

1103
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,880
but the same token if you're dealing

1104
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,680
with a business or a corporation or an

1105
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,119
enterprise or

1106
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,200
booz allen hamilton you're dealing with

1107
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,720
like loads of stuff you can't be

1108
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,320
responsible for monitoring every

1109
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,480
employee 24 7. that's why you vet the

1110
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,000
employee beforehand you see whether

1111
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,760
they're going to leak stuff beforehand

1112
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,000
you

1113
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
try and get a gauge of the personality

1114
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,680
clearly i will never be employed at booz

1115
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,000
allen hamilton but that's another story

1116
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
but yeah you just you have to vet that

1117
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,920
stuff because all that happens is

1118
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,280
you're gonna have to either treat your

1119
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
employees like children or lock

1120
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,960
everything down to a point where it's

1121
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,800
just going to grind all work to a halt

1122
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,079
you have to get management approval

1123
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,320
every two minutes

1124
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,599
between liability and criminality right

1125
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,079
so right so i think there's a couple of

1126
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,359
things here you've

1127
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,800
the the statement says companies should

1128
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,720
always be responsible so we've based

1129
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,560
whether they should or shouldn't on

1130
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,680
the court the court of public opinion

1131
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,280
surely that's just that's not whether

1132
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,560
they should or shouldn't that's just a

1133
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,680
bad

1134
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,320
response to things so the actual quacks

1135
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,000
question is do we morally think someone

1136
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,520
should be responsible for the actions of

1137
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,720
all the people that work for them which

1138
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,240
i don't think we've answered

1139
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,359
um but also if you if you if you take

1140
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:13,760
that

1141
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,680
through it during working hours so i'm

1142
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,599
sitting at home on a monday lunchtime

1143
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,400
during working hours and i'm on my

1144
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,839
personal laptop and i do something

1145
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,079
stupid or that causes a fence or

1146
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,160
say something bad or you know whatever

1147
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,200
it happens to be

1148
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,640
is the company responsible for me doing

1149
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,160
something on my personal laptop that's

1150
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,599
inappropriate just because it happens to

1151
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,599
be between the hours of nine to five

1152
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,560
what happens if it's a 531 so how do we

1153
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,440
distinguish

1154
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
what do we what do we kind of call it

1155
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,800
mean by actions here

1156
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
um i think we've kind of got a defined

1157
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,160
set that we may be saying

1158
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,079
is a if you narrowed the question say we

1159
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,440
should be responsible for what someone

1160
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,119
does with the company's data

1161
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,040
during working hours on company devices

1162
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,560
you might get to a point where we agree

1163
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,200
on that

1164
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,960
but this is so broad or you're saying

1165
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,400
you're responsible for all actions of

1166
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,560
your employee during a set of hours

1167
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,720
but not outside if i steal data after i

1168
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,800
finish work so it's 6 30 i finished work

1169
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,960
at 5 30 i still have some data at 6 30

1170
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,119
not during working hours you're not

1171
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,720
responsible at that point

1172
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,520
this is

1173
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
but this is the thing this is the thing

1174
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,160
when i started with a company that deals

1175
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,480
years ago when heavily with reputation

1176
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,440
they they

1177
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,920
gave me very specific guidelines that i

1178
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,040
had to follow

1179
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,119
and it was including like locking down

1180
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,880
my personal social media

1181
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,760
not uh linking uh when i'm presenting

1182
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
for example at conferences i wasn't

1183
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,040
presenting as them i was presenting it

1184
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,760
was me

1185
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,800
so if if you're talking about companies

1186
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,560
um being responsible employees during

1187
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,720
working hours from my perception my

1188
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,599
understanding

1189
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,720
that skype is as a business or on the

1190
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,680
business

1191
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,599
laptop or within their business

1192
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,880
environment or

1193
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,000
representing the company and publicly

1194
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,320
and i i would say this is the thing

1195
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,400
though because

1196
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,359
you're when you hire somebody you're

1197
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,119
hiring because you believe that they're

1198
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,560
not going to do bad things

1199
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,280
and you do background checks you do

1200
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,680
limit

1201
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,359
their access or you should limit their

1202
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,520
access based on what they actually need

1203
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,160
to do

1204
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,520
and put protections in place if that is

1205
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,240
all done and they're still doing not so

1206
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,920
good things you then take actions to

1207
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,480
remove them from the environment so

1208
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,680
in my personal opinion that appears

1209
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,200
like you're taking responsibility

1210
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,400
because you're saying yeah they're doing

1211
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,040
something wrong

1212
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,440
they're you know they're making us look

1213
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,480
really bad

1214
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,880
and so we're going to remove them if

1215
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,000
you're saying well it's not

1216
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,920
really our fault because they can make

1217
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,280
their own decisions

1218
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,200
then you're not really protecting them

1219
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,640
are you you're just

1220
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,760
saying well i think you know please be

1221
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,400
good

1222
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,319
um and i'm not going to do anything if

1223
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,560
you're bad so just for clarity

1224
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,079
if i on my personal laptop at my home

1225
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,440
because i'm working from home

1226
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,119
type post something on the internet that

1227
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,560
you think is inappropriate

1228
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,079
you think the company's responsible for

1229
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,160
my actions at that point

1230
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,520
if you're saying me as this person

1231
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,119
working at this company

1232
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,040
no no but if i if you're just placing it

1233
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,319
as a person

1234
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,240
doesn't know what the question says

1235
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
you're arguing for a different question

1236
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,280
you've chosen to reframe the question

1237
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,560
to argue something because you don't

1238
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,319
agree with that point yourselves okay

1239
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,599
now you've changed that question just

1240
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,960
say something really quickly

1241
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
just to clarify so the the crux of the

1242
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,839
morrison's argument because i'm a i'm

1243
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,280
this sort of person so i watch the

1244
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,560
entire supreme court

1245
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,359
uh trial but the crux of the argument

1246
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,040
was they actually relied on another case

1247
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,240
from morrison's where

1248
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,520
a petrol station attendant had

1249
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,839
gone outside and had beaten up a

1250
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:42,880
customer

1251
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,040
um outside of the forecast and not on

1252
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,240
morrison's property

1253
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,079
and they held morrisons vicariously

1254
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,440
liable for

1255
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,640
the assault on this individual so he was

1256
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,319
during on during work hours he was

1257
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,640
wearing his work uniform he'd met the

1258
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,359
customer

1259
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,920
on the petrol forecourt and then

1260
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,280
proceeded to leave the the

1261
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,880
area and then go and beat him up down

1262
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,720
the road and they held morrison's

1263
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,040
liable for that so what do you think

1264
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,480
about that do you think that's right or

1265
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,680
do you think that's wrong according to

1266
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,040
your arguments

1267
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,760
according to my argument that is holding

1268
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,440
them responsible because

1269
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,760
he's met him at work and he's wearing

1270
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,800
his uniform

1271
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,359
and i don't really like i don't know how

1272
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,400
you could say that

1273
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,760
isn't responsible it's just like that um

1274
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,520
that lady on i think it was a lady on

1275
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,839
twitter that received

1276
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,920
um she went to get tech support and then

1277
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,200
the tech support person

1278
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,440
used the email he gained access to

1279
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,359
through supporting her to then contact

1280
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,240
her privately

1281
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,560
again that would in my opinion would

1282
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,359
make that

1283
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,760
company have to deal with it if that

1284
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,800
makes sense

1285
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,680
also as well what what if this is a

1286
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,599
premier league footballer in his own

1287
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,520
time who goes out and headbutts somebody

1288
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,200
what's going to happen there

1289
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,040
you know i'm real for one for

1290
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,160
if he's a footballer another probably

1291
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,799
lose the fight

1292
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,960
but also a good example is in canada

1293
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,520
um for the ice hockey we had that guy

1294
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,880
what was his name was a cane or

1295
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,359
something

1296
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,160
very young guy got a lot of money being

1297
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,800
young

1298
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,720
and he spent it and went crazy did lots

1299
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,240
of crazy things

1300
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,000
and everybody looked very badly on him

1301
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,240
and the comp oh that brand he was weird

1302
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,680
but this i think there's two separate

1303
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,280
points there so if people looking

1304
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,119
badly on the brand yes they might do

1305
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,160
that but is it actually the

1306
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,839
responsibility around how he behaves

1307
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:28,880
that's the question we're trying to

1308
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,599
answer

1309
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,400
yeah so the court of public opinion is

1310
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,440
totally different to the

1311
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,040
the responsibility angle i would

1312
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,720
disagree because in a breach

1313
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,240
if okay so in a bridge if you

1314
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,960
you know do something really bad um and

1315
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,400
everybody's like holy [ __ ] you did

1316
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,359
something really bad

1317
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,520
and the ico goes okay well we probably

1318
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,040
should investigate them

1319
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,480
they're going to you know it's more like

1320
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,319
they're going to investigate them and

1321
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,359
that does take that is a big part if

1322
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:57,680
you're

1323
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,160
breached and you have x fine but your

1324
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,760
reputational loss is

1325
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,160
so massive that's going to affect your

1326
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,280
business as well

1327
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,000
so i i think that reputation should be

1328
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,640
cut

1329
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,400
and the public opinion should okay we've

1330
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,160
got to draw a line under it subconscious

1331
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,800
of the time

1332
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,920
um the results are in and zoe and

1333
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,599
ian have won this with uh 52

1334
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,880
i told you they just took me

1335
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,359
so the third and final statement that

1336
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,480
they're going to have a whole load of

1337
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,560
people argue about on a sunday

1338
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,680
is a company or public body should never

1339
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,000
pay

1340
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,560
a ransom so kevin and scott agree with

1341
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,280
this and

1342
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,599
zoe and ian are disagreeing with this

1343
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,319
and as

1344
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,960
uh before the poll is now up and live on

1345
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,560
twitter so get voting

1346
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,400
over to you kevin and scott this time

1347
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,760
but just don't stop talking and we'll

1348
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,480
win

1349
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,200
yeah okay so that's my forte i can do

1350
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,599
that

1351
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,400
right so agree agree agree agree agree

1352
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,000
agree a million times agree how many

1353
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,760
times have we seen someone's been ransom

1354
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,440
weird six months later

1355
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,599
there's uh there's an update someone's

1356
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,599
done d hash stuff someone started

1357
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,040
working on it people have written back

1358
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,560
doors into it they've analyzed the

1359
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,280
malware

1360
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,119
and managed to somehow reverse it if

1361
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,520
we're paying we're literally paying

1362
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,839
we're basically showing it's it's like

1363
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,960
um

1364
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,400
there's a phrase or a word i'm looking

1365
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,240
for that's basically saying look

1366
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,920
you know you're being rewarded for

1367
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,119
committing this crime and it's just

1368
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,480
gonna get worse and they're gonna keep

1369
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,440
using that

1370
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,760
like paying up straight away is a really

1371
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,680
bad idea paying up even after six months

1372
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,440
is a bad idea or two years

1373
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,359
i don't think it should be done where a

1374
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,920
reward in the crooks and b

1375
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,040
yeah yeah that's where i said kevin yeah

1376
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,680
so i think

1377
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,960
the big one for me on this as well is

1378
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,400
you're fundamentally funding organized

1379
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,119
crime

1380
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,040
yeah it's the reason why if you look at

1381
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,560
you know i came from kind of financial

1382
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,000
services and if you look at

1383
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,599
like banks and financial services kind

1384
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,200
of accept a certain amount of fraud

1385
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,319
the cost of doing business um the police

1386
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,000
and people deal with criminals

1387
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
don't want any of that because every

1388
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,440
penny that goes through to affordable

1389
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,200
crime is funding drugs

1390
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,800
trafficking children all of the really

1391
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,480
bad stuff that's where this money goes

1392
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,839
is giving is funding that kind of

1393
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:06,800
criminality

1394
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,560
so if you pay the ransom you're paying

1395
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,079
the worst criminals and funding

1396
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,920
organized crime fundamentally

1397
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,760
um aside from the fact of the year it's

1398
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,119
got excellent points around you

1399
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,240
you've got no guarantee it's going to

1400
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,599
get unencrypted you've got no guarantee

1401
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,720
they won't do it again

1402
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,480
you become a bigger target you make more

1403
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,760
people want to do it because as soon as

1404
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,720
crime pays

1405
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,640
guess what people flock to it you look

1406
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,079
at any look at how things happen across

1407
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:26,720
the internet

1408
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,240
as soon as one thing works whether it's

1409
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,400
ransomware whether it's ddos whether

1410
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,440
it's whatever else

1411
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,119
as soon as it starts working everyone

1412
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,480
starts doing it because you see the

1413
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,040
money

1414
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,560
so you follow it and get more of it the

1415
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,000
more you pay the more people do it

1416
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,800
because the more

1417
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,480
more people want to make that money so

1418
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,000
culture reference for anybody

1419
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,640
watching uh season one episode one mr

1420
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,119
robot

1421
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,680
slightly different context but you just

1422
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,440
keep coming back and asking for more

1423
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,319
money so

1424
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,680
yeah absolutely so long and short of it

1425
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,960
you'll make the problem worse you've got

1426
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,319
no guarantee it's gonna be okay and you

1427
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,880
are funding organized crime

1428
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,839
so i'm not going to jump in here so so

1429
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,640
your argument

1430
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,920
is bad people will do [ __ ] that's the

1431
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,280
end

1432
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,640
of it if you pay the money

1433
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,880
people do [ __ ] right if you pay bad

1434
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,640
people to do bad [ __ ] they do more bad

1435
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,359
[ __ ] yeah and

1436
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,640
and they yeah but if you don't pay them

1437
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,079
they're still going to do bad [ __ ]

1438
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,200
like what we're talking about is you're

1439
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,520
reducing the opportunistic ones a lot of

1440
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,440
criminals a lot of criminals have day

1441
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,319
jobs

1442
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,559
you know they think they do jobs in

1443
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,160
their lives so far your only argument is

1444
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,520
you shouldn't pay which they might do

1445
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,720
anyway my my argument is not that my

1446
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,760
argument is

1447
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,559
when it's in a perfect world when there

1448
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,119
is

1449
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,000
you know you prepared properly you're

1450
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,559
able to

1451
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,040
do this and it's all good and ready and

1452
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,800
you're able to restore from backup

1453
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,000
awesome but as we know the world is not

1454
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,880
perfect

1455
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,119
if a company fails to properly protect

1456
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,599
their environment or their people

1457
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,920
and the only option is to pay and it's

1458
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,200
not something they could

1459
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,280
you know it wasn't designed with a flaw

1460
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,640
and you can't

1461
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,839
literally there's no other option

1462
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,480
you do have to make some payments or

1463
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,079
people lose the job and

1464
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,880
more more people are impacted a company

1465
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,240
goes out of business

1466
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,400
and you know who who are you really

1467
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
failing in this situation yes you did

1468
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,839
fail you failed in the beginning because

1469
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,680
you got it in the first place you failed

1470
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,920
because you didn't protect it yes but

1471
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,280
also are you going to then

1472
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,720
make somebody lose their job and maybe

1473
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,800
not feed their children or

1474
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,880
not be able to afford to live like

1475
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,200
the little bit the little bit that

1476
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,400
you're making

1477
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,680
in this payment is not going to by not

1478
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,599
paying it you're not going to stop cyber

1479
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,319
criminals

1480
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,880
you're not going to solve and the world

1481
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,800
is going to become peaceful again

1482
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,640
it's not going to make that difference

1483
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,559
what it is going to do is it's going to

1484
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,400
make your business be able to run again

1485
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,920
but you're you're you have a really

1486
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,119
really good point

1487
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:03,839
um so you should make that one yeah

1488
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,760
there's a really good book by a chap

1489
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,119
called chris voss

1490
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,040
called never split the difference now

1491
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,720
chris is an ex-fbi

1492
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,599
negotiator and has worked on many ransom

1493
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,880
cases

1494
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,599
and and has actually been in a lot of

1495
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,920
high-profile hostage situations and

1496
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
unfortunately he does say you have to

1497
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,760
pay the ransom at some point you don't

1498
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,200
always have to pay

1499
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,079
the rent what what the ransomer wants

1500
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,599
because actually they are in it to

1501
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,280
extort money and we all don't want to

1502
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,640
fund crime kev i

1503
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,880
i think i think we're all agreed on that

1504
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,640
right we don't want to fund crime

1505
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,559
we don't want to perpetuate it but

1506
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,079
unfortunately there's people out there

1507
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,599
who will do bad stuff

1508
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,960
and the question comes is what if the

1509
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,400
ransom is to save a life

1510
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,640
what if that ransom is to un unlock a

1511
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,119
national health service set of computers

1512
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,000
quite relevant i think um where a bunch

1513
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,839
of them are connected to ventilators

1514
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,440
that are keeping people alive well what

1515
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,559
do you do do you stand on your

1516
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:01,760
principles then

1517
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,119
and you turn around and go we're not

1518
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,040
gonna fund this or

1519
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,280
or do you have it as a sensible risk

1520
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,720
mitigation approach

1521
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,280
but i'm gonna caution on this as well

1522
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,960
that shouldn't be your risk mitigation

1523
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,800
approach all the time right

1524
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,119
you only get to use it the once and you

1525
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,000
really make you

1526
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,079
really need to up your game after that

1527
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,680
but if surely if people's

1528
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,400
lives are on the line you can't stand on

1529
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,640
principles because we aren't politicians

1530
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,160
we aren't the people who will

1531
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
grandstand this and stand up and say we

1532
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,520
won't pay ransoms

1533
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,800
because at the end of the day that

1534
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
decision we then make will ultimately

1535
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,240
end up with people who die

1536
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,920
but that assumes that people are going

1537
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,640
to be honest and up front and actually

1538
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,359
and actually unlock uh you know unlock

1539
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,800
their actually yeah but if that's your

1540
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,680
only option

1541
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,200
but this is the thing if your only

1542
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,119
option is to pay

1543
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,280
from your point of view the only the

1544
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,400
only solution

1545
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,160
is to pay and you pay and they don't

1546
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,240
unlock it you did everything you could

1547
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,280
so but you've got a couple of challenges

1548
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,559
ian says we're not politicians but he's

1549
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,520
gone straight to the standard

1550
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,800
politicians argument

1551
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,240
for any kind of legislation where you

1552
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,359
want to do something you shouldn't which

1553
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,119
is talk about life and limb so

1554
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:08,720
i'll make it seem like if you don't

1555
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,640
agree to this lies will be lost

1556
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,559
therefore your bad news

1557
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,240
i'm not saying in every situation in

1558
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,160
some situations it is

1559
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,119
it is what happens and when people lose

1560
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,240
their job

1561
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,400
even if it's not a direct they're dying

1562
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,359
today

1563
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,599
you are impacting them three minutes

1564
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,200
left three minutes left

1565
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,800
but then the point you've got obsidian

1566
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,319
is if we're going to talk about life and

1567
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,760
limb and people losing lives and

1568
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,880
whatever else

1569
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,119
this money goes to organized crime that

1570
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,359
goes to selling drugs to your children

1571
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,599
so you're going to lose lives that's

1572
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,440
your your argument

1573
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
well that was ian's argument ian jumps

1574
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,480
in with the life and limb

1575
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,000
things if you guys are going to go to

1576
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,240
life

1577
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,000
they should die because we didn't plan

1578
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,240
properly they should die for the cause

1579
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,960
or people should die because we are

1580
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,480
should pay principals to commit crime

1581
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,680
that's what you're saying

1582
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,839
okay guys we don't have much time left

1583
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,280
we will die because criminals commit

1584
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,480
crime

1585
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,240
maybe unsurprisingly the results are

1586
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,200
50-50 oh

1587
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,800

00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,480
it's a really good cause and it's one

1593
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,040

1594
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,040
