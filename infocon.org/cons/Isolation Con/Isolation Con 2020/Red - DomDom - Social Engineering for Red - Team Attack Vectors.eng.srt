1
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,240
so we are back now

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,160
uh i hope everyone is still with me or

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,599
with us here

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,119
and i hope you can actually see the

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,960
screen now is that correct

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,840
confirm fantastic lovely so as you can

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,719
see that's probably

8
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,440
my journey with this whole quarantine

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
thing and with this technology that is

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,239
moving to

11
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,879
everything virtual all the conferences

12
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:43,440
and then

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,280
just right at the beginning i have to

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
make a little admission so

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,320
i think it was about six weeks ago uh

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
when someone because all the conferences

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
were going virtual

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
uh replied to me and said yeah look tom

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,160
are you able to do the conference also

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,760
virtual as supposed to be in copenhagen

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,960
and so on

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
and i said yes of course i can try i

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
need to beef up my my home equipment

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,479
for that matter but i will try and then

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,400
somehow later got the reply and

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,600
she was saying to me based on a question

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,720
i ask

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,280
okay how do we share and do this and so

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
on and others can view the content

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,920
and she wrote back we use twitch we are

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
twitching

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,840
and uh to my surprise as i thought you

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,840
know that's probably a

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,520
a spell correction error she mean

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
twitter because i never heard of twitch

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,880
before so you know i did

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,640
what what level of technology i am

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,720
currently and to all the

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,240
all the people out there who think they

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,400
know everything probably it's not the

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,079
case so i'm glad i'm

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,880
here with you today i can talk about my

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,680
favorite topic

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
social engineering in the context of red

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
teaming and

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
hope to give you some ideas for your

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,880
business

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,520
and most importantly how you can better

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
manage your risks in the context of

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
social engineering

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,799
um i say just at the beginning you saw

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,479
you know this little graphic down there

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,079
which probably would be the dream of

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,600
every social engineer

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,318
if you can impose those settings on

56
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,239
everyone involved in social engineering

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,120
so you know

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,800
read all believing or hold back mode etc

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,560
of course that's not possible i think

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,000
the biggest risk

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
come actually with humans and with human

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
interaction

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
and i really don't like the definition

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
of human or the weakest link

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,239
because from my point of view human are

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,319
actually the strongest link you will

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,040
ever have and always keep that in mind

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
and sometimes i just believe

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
this is a cheap excuse for bad

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
engineering if you tell people

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,879
people are the weakest link so everyone

72
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,800
needs to beef up their game

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
social engineering is here and it's an

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,080
apt

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,319
which will not be forgotten so let's

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
dive into the topic itself

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,519
we do have different uh definitions for

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,360
social engineering of course

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
mostly in our context we use the i.t

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,560
security

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,680
definition for social engineering and

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
there are

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,959
i don't know hundreds probably thousands

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,040
of definitions out there

85
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
around social engineering and what it

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,480
actually means

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
some of them i do like some of them i

88
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,519
really don't like

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,200
and for me it's basically these

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,440
elicitation of information

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,080
from systems networks or human beings

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,840
through methods and tools

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,200
so for me the information i'm obtaining

94
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,799
and keep in mind informationism is an

95
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,840
asset or data is an asset as such

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,360
and also the smallest information

97
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,400
is an asset that

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,560
every bit counts and i don't know if

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,599
this information

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,879
is you know being a problem if it has

101
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,879
been obtained illegally

102
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,200
it can be misused or not so for me it's

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,480
just information

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,640
what i'm gaining and of course i just

105
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
added the political definition of social

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,840
engineering as well because you're

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,040
socially engineered

108
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,680
in the way we work in the daily lives we

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,080
have

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,519
so you get steered as people in a

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,439
supermarket for instance or you get

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,640
let's buy

113
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
advertisements etc etc and we can see

114
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,280
this now as well

115
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
with this covet applications which are

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,880
popping up like

117
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,120
mushrooms you know everyone wants to

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
have a tracing

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,560
app or a tracking app or what the hell

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
they want to do with that

121
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,479
and under the cover of koit it's now

122
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,600
fairly easy

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000
to bring technology to people which is

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,560
sometimes maybe not really necessary

125
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,639
um but that's more from a political

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,720
sense of influencing people

127
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
in their behavior in their actions in

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,160
what they do or

129
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,639
in their perception of the situation so

130
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,160
everyone believes

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,479
that maybe for social engineering for a

132
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,840
political purpose

133
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,440
uh is being misused at the moment

134
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
down on the right hand side you see a

135
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,919
little crowbar or chemi

136
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,400
i think it's been defined or used in the

137
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,280
uk

138
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
so social engineering is all about

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,720
finding

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,840
that little point that angle point you

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
can set on

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,280
and it can be find in many different

143
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
areas or ways of people

144
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,039
so that's what social engineer actually

145
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,840
do now i want to talk to you about

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
what maybe is in your context more

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
important for the red teaming side

148
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
of things is the attack vectors so what

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
attack vectors are you're using

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,440
and what attack vectors are out there

151
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,720
here just uh

152
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,639
made a little summary of some common

153
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,000
attack vectors

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
so it's you know if you look at the

155
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,440
pictures from uh

156
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
bottom left to the top right it's maybe

157
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,280
the standard attack vectors

158
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,960
to the highly targeted attack vectors so

159
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,160
we do have of course normal fishing

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,080
we have spearfishing which is a bit more

161
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,520
targeted and then we have whaling

162
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,720
attacks

163
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,759
we have on there as well eavesdropping

164
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,880
for instance

165
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,360
we have tailgating baiting the use of

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,080
authority

167
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,800
as a means for social engineering uh

168
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,840
impersonation

169
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,319
dumpster diving shoulder surfing and

170
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
many many many more

171
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
i did also developed this i can pack to

172
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,319
actually

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,039
talk to my clients and with them about

174
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,160
what's their goal

175
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,919
of the social engineering attack or

176
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
maybe the red teaming attack so

177
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,240
it needs to be crystal clear especially

178
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
in the corporate world where i am

179
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
working

180
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,199
what are you going to do and why are you

181
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,240
going to do

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,280
what are the risks associated with your

183
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,240
tasks

184
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
and what's the goal of your tasks so i

185
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,919
think that has become quite clear in the

186
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,800
last 25 years i've been working within

187
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,319
this area

188
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,440
of information security that's the most

189
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,479
important point

190
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,720
you need to learn to speak the business

191
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
language it's not enough you're talking

192
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,759
about your

193
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,319
technical capabilities or what you can

194
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,240
actually do or about the tools

195
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,720
you need to talk about risk and i think

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,400
especially today

197
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,280
where risk tolerance is quite to zero so

198
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,120
companies and corporations

199
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,960
are not will not allow any risks

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,280
encompassing let's say pen testing and

201
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
other engagements of this sort

202
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,440
within their infrastructure so you need

203
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,199
to find ways around that

204
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,160
or maybe do different testing so you can

205
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,440
prove the same thing

206
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,000
but also always keeping in mind what's

207
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
the reason and what's the purpose

208
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,680
of your testing and of your social

209
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,960
engineering engagements

210
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,240
of course on the top right i'm showing

211
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,560
you

212
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,199
very quickly i actually also have

213
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,840
planned to give out you some files

214
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,800
which is then the complete information

215
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
about these attack vectors and their

216
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,919
definitions

217
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
on the top right you see advanced highly

218
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
targeted attack vector

219
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
so we do have made and that's

220
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
custom made by us we do have a

221
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,000
combination of what has been used in

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,080
family therapy and some other items and

223
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
we do then actually

224
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,759
mark a target or collect information

225
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,919
about the specific target

226
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,680
but it's not the standard information

227
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
you can find online

228
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
so where is this person connected where

229
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,319
is this person

230
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,520
living or who where is it working what

231
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,680
certification does this person have

232
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,639
it's about the emotional relations the

233
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,919
person have

234
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,800
which then also in due course can of

235
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,360
course be used as attack vectors

236
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,199
so as you can see on this picture it's a

237
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,879
very simplistic view

238
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,120
of actually what we do with this called

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
scr maps

240
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,958
social and emotional response maps it's

241
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,519
the

242
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,279
target person is in the middle that's

243
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,440
chris which is 45

244
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,279
and this is a mapping you can do in the

245
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,880
field or this is also

246
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,440
a mapping you can do within a meeting

247
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,480
also

248
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,000
what i'm showing you is what you

249
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,320
typically have if you're sitting in a

250
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,040
meeting

251
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
we have your decision makers there your

252
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,560
key stakeholders

253
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,519
and then it's about making a decision

254
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,399
and then of course

255
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,560
on one hand you have the usual

256
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
organizational chart

257
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
of this company or of this setting and

258
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,360
then you have the

259
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,640
inofficial organizational chart so if in

260
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
within a discussion the ceo is looking

261
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,519
to the cto for instance for decisions

262
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,760
then you know exactly the structure on

263
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,279
paper is not the structure

264
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,680
reflected in real life so that's what

265
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,360
you do here in a graphical way

266
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,920
so in this example it's very easy chris

267
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
45 is a target person

268
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
he's focused on an 18 year old claire

269
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
males or a square and the woman or

270
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
circles

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,560
then he had an affair in 2014 with

272
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
tiffany which is 20.

273
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
uh married 99 with 44 year old alice

274
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
and he has a friend bob who has ptsd 45

275
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,760
year old

276
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,120
the double lines references to that's a

277
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,279
very strong connection

278
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,519
the wiggly lines means actually that

279
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,240
alice is a bit hostile towards bob

280
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
so we do have now collected information

281
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
which is then enriched with intelligence

282
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,680
about the emotional relationships and we

283
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,800
can use that

284
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,760
so of course very easy here what kind of

285
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
phishing emails would you send chris

286
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,560
very easy of course young women

287
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,360
would probably appeal to him i guess or

288
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,240
you can drive

289
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
try to drive a wedge between alice and

290
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,399
bob or the other way around

291
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,160
so that would be also an angle you could

292
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
play so

293
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,120
information becomes um how can i say

294
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
that

295
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,600
maybe sounds a bit it becomes dangerous

296
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,760
if you make intelligence out of it but

297
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,519
it depends what kind of intelligence you

298
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,560
make out of it

299
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
uh utrc also a list with items from one

300
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,480
to six

301
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,320
that's what you actually are looking for

302
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,920
with this so-called scr

303
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,040
maps you look for pattern recognition uh

304
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,519
is this person drinking what political

305
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,120
views does this person have

306
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
is he always going to the gym on

307
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,120
wednesday is he attending conferences

308
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,519
live on sundays for instance

309
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,279
you look for out of character you look

310
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,120
for emotionally loaded areas

311
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,079
in congruences in personal business life

312
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,040
strongly

313
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,200
highly developed areas or underdeveloped

314
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,760
areas and all this information will give

315
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,800
you an angle

316
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,120
so you can make a perfect attack vector

317
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
for social engineering

318
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,880
of course that's only done for very

319
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480
important tasks um

320
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,440
or very specific tasks and not in your

321
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,480
daily life

322
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,160
in your daily life you would apply the

323
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
standard attack vectors and for

324
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
each of those attack vectors there is a

325
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,040
definition

326
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,000
of how risky they are in terms of

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,279
executing them

328
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,600
now i'm going really to bore you i don't

329
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
know if it's late at your place

330
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
or early in the morning i know it's

331
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,880
unbearable to see such a picture i guess

332
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,760
but this is actually um you will find a

333
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,000
lot of checklists out there about social

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,800
engineering

335
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
and they're all really good so if you're

336
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
interested in using social engineering

337
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
as another business or means instead of

338
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
just pen testing

339
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
you will engage in social engineering

340
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,519
tasks for instance

341
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,120
and you want to engage on a corporate

342
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,279
level you need to have a certain

343
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,200
methodology in place

344
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,680
of course you need to have that in place

345
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,399
so

346
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,720
here is just really the the complete

347
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,760
overview of what

348
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,639
processes you need to have in place and

349
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,000
through

350
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,079
how you work through these processes

351
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,440
during your engagement

352
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
for instance and i can just say the most

353
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,760
important learnings

354
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,320
i have throughout my professional life

355
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,040
is

356
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,760
risk management is paramount and i think

357
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,800
especially

358
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,839
in information security i will show you

359
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,920
later a couple of examples

360
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,639
how i wanted to actually defeat this and

361
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,800
this is about using intensity levels but

362
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,560
here it's really about

363
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,600
seeing who is your customer how do you

364
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,079
engage with this customer for instance

365
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,760
there are regulations

366
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
like companies which are for instance

367
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
blacklisted

368
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,959
and you should not work together with

369
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,040
them they are export restrictions

370
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,720
companies with those things

371
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,240
they are companies which have certain

372
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,399
ties to

373
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
bigger corporate companies which you

374
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,320
should probably not engage

375
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,480
i think it's really important especially

376
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,639
if you are maybe a startup company

377
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,880
or a smaller company that you go through

378
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
these steps

379
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
make it an easier version i will show

380
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,680
you just in a minute how you can do that

381
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,000
so here is the bare minimum so you have

382
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,399
a processes which are pre-engagement

383
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,120
before you

384
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,440
actually engage with the customer you

385
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,560
have processes

386
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,040
during the engagement so during running

387
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,959
your red teaming engagement

388
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,880
what do you do what you have to consider

389
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,399
what you need to look for

390
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,880
and you have processes of course after

391
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,079
post engagement

392
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,880
from this perspective the most important

393
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,800
one is here this checks it's just four

394
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,519
processes

395
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
if you if you break it down to the bare

396
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,880
minimum just

397
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,440
look at these four processes so you have

398
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,279
the client selection acquisition

399
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,920
you really check out your client because

400
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,639
what i figured out i also have uh

401
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,800
experience myself is if you're a small

402
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,279
company you tend to get

403
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,839
some contracts or jobs and you really

404
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,880
should consider

405
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
what the greater consequences of these

406
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,920
jobs are

407
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,720
sometimes if i just say it straight out

408
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
you will be misused you will be misused

409
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,800
from some companies

410
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,440
in terms of they want to use you maybe

411
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,079
to

412
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,240
get information on the competition to

413
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
slander their competition

414
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,079
and you're just a means to an end to get

415
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,600
them this information

416
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
they cannot obtain themselves so you

417
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,639
really need to be careful

418
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,120
uh about that just decide client

419
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
selection and acquisition you also have

420
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,680
to say no

421
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,240
to certain clients of course you want to

422
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,680
engage with them second one is the

423
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
scoping and approach

424
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
make it perfectly clear how you engage

425
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,959
with your client

426
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,440
and what the specific risks are there

427
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,120
are good checklists out there

428
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,600
rules of engagement etc you can use and

429
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,320
apply

430
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
but this is really important also we

431
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,800
have this had this cases

432
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
which is so called get out of jail

433
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,639
letter which the

434
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,160
client tries to indemnify yourself and

435
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
kind of approves the action you're

436
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
taking but in some cases he

437
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,399
cannot do that for instance in

438
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,360
switzerland

439
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,959
and other companies as well the

440
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,279
reception desk is manned by a different

441
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,000
company

442
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,120
so it's a different legal entity so

443
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,000
even if the client tells you whatever he

444
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
wanted to tell you

445
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
and wraps it in a pink paper or what

446
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,759
he cannot take that risk away so if you

447
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
are breaching

448
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,279
a legal different legal company for

449
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,199
instance this company will come after

450
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:39,600
you

451
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,320
because you have to think it of this way

452
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,560
this company their reputation is based

453
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,920
on they're doing a good

454
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,399
job so if their reputation is going

455
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,120
around

456
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,839
oh there have been breaches so they have

457
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
been social engineered people are

458
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,000
passing

459
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,720
by their batch has been checked there

460
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,959
was tailgating and all these things

461
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,360
you ruin these companies so they will go

462
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,079
after you

463
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,880
really really heavily and they will do

464
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,440
that

465
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
because it doesn't matter it's a

466
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
different legal entity so always try to

467
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,160
keep in mind

468
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,040
what are you doing in what context and

469
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,079
of course after that

470
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,600
you have deliverable and approach

471
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,680
monitoring so during the engagement you

472
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,399
have to constantly deliver

473
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,079
you have to constantly monitor the

474
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,600
developments

475
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,320
of the client and of your job so what's

476
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
happening with the client

477
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
is he going into the receivership is

478
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
there some merger maybe out there

479
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,079
so you need to have an eye not only on

480
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,160
the job but also on the environment

481
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,399
of your job and of course during the

482
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
whole engagement

483
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,480
you have to check the risk assessment

484
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,240
what are you doing if your

485
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,800
attack vectors are working that you're

486
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,639
changing the attack vectors you need

487
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,560
approval to change the attack factors

488
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,040
etc etc i think this is really important

489
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,240
it's basic it's boring i know but if you

490
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,560
want to have a job in the long term

491
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
and getting old and not being sent to

492
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,000
prison it's maybe a good thing you

493
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,880
consider

494
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,919
those methods and processes

495
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,839
here is really quickly i will skim over

496
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,679
them it's more like a documentation

497
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,240
for yourself what i just said what you

498
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
do then within this process group as a

499
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,599
bare minimum

500
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,760
you check for these items it gives you

501
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,720
an idea

502
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,599
what you can actually looking for so you

503
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,720
look at the workload and the

504
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,760
consideration

505
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,079
you look at the skills match etc and i

506
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,760
said this is all

507
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,320
based on the context of risk management

508
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,200
and risk tolerance for corporations

509
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
they don't tolerate if you send

510
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,240
something which doesn't have the skills

511
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
you will have big discussion

512
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,840
also they tolerate they don't tolerate

513
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
if you accepting a big job and then you

514
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,360
say i don't have the resources

515
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,720
etc etc it's more about management

516
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,520
of course than maybe just the attack

517
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
vector development but we will cover

518
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,919
this

519
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,799
just after this section scoping approach

520
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,720
selection is the same thing

521
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,039
this will just give you an idea about

522
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,080
how you develop it

523
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,760
and how you control it and of course

524
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,280
these are different people so you have

525
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,039
people for the execution

526
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,200
which are executing your attack vectors

527
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,720
which are doing the social engineering

528
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,360
tasks you might have a project manager

529
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,600
and the client representative and also

530
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,520
you have your management and all of them

531
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,440
play an essential part in having a

532
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
successful social engineering or red

533
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,080
teaming attack

534
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,960
this is the last process from this group

535
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,799
so we can now

536
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,160
proceed to the more interesting bits i

537
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,679
guess

538
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,880
so now i wanted to look here with you

539
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,760
at the attack vector development how do

540
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,080
you develop an attack vector i think

541
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,919
the basic for this attack vector

542
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,000
development is you wanted to develop

543
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,280
your attack vectors

544
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,360
you are creating a database of them

545
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,320
hopefully

546
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,400
and you can reuse them at your next

547
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,000
engagement or also

548
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,160
what is really crucial at the corporate

549
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
level if you do some testing

550
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,039
within one country you do have to do the

551
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
same testing in the other country

552
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,480
or you do have to do the same testing um

553
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
if you are coming back a year later so

554
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,039
you need to know

555
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,160
how did i have done this test what were

556
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
the results

557
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
were there any changes and you have to

558
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,799
test in the same way

559
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,520
otherwise the results are not comparable

560
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,000
so that's the most important part about

561
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,320
attack vectors documenting the attack

562
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,120
vectors

563
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
and having them ready so we can reuse

564
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,160
them and

565
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,120
always apply the same methodology not of

566
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,880
course to get the same results

567
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
but to get the same setting for the

568
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
testing correct

569
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,440
so on this little graphic you see how

570
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,520
you actually start with an attack vector

571
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,559
at the very

572
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,919
high level that's like a 20 000 feet

573
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,039
foot view it's information collection of

574
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,160
course you will collect

575
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,559
information you can decide either you

576
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,039
buy the information of the market

577
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,679
or you create the information yourselves

578
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,039
you are collecting information

579
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,080
yourselves

580
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,159
then for some of the things are maybe

581
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,000
just you know you can

582
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,159
always cut out some steps which are not

583
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,440
important to you

584
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
this has been just become quite

585
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,559
extensive

586
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,960
because we had so to cover so many risks

587
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,720
and we had to do so many engagements so

588
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,120
that's

589
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,360
the basically a dump of the experience

590
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,240
we made

591
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,120
which became important buying is rather

592
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,320
a passive process

593
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,240
and if you're making information it's

594
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,919
passive or could be active

595
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,000
it depends and then of course you can

596
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
use different means

597
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,960
for this information collection signal

598
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,000
intelligence os intelligence etc etc

599
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
um the information of course you

600
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,200
document

601
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,760
and then very important either it's

602
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,679
fact-based documentation

603
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,240
or intelligence based what do i mean by

604
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
that so

605
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,120
fact-based is if you take the

606
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,559
information and document it

607
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,679
intelligence-based information is

608
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,039
basically information

609
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,760
which then has been enriched by a person

610
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,200
maybe a psychologist

611
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
who makes a statement about person xyz

612
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,360
has this attributes or is reacting to

613
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,280
this or maybe has these problems

614
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,840
etc so that's intelligence-based

615
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,039
information

616
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,080
it becomes then important if you the

617
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
 hits the fan for instance and you

618
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,120
need to have

619
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
[Music]

620
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
you need to have a fact check or you do

621
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,200
a review of the engagement of the task

622
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,240
you have been doing

623
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,480
and you're looking back and you want to

624
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,360
know why

625
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,919
did we came to the conclusion at this

626
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,799
time

627
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,600
and then you know i was fact-based uh

628
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,720
back then we

629
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
had an interpretation of the situation

630
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,240
or of the data like this

631
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
and that's how we came about it so

632
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,640
that's only for very specific purposes

633
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,480
then you develop the attack vector you

634
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,120
select it based on the time you have

635
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,799
based on the success factors you have

636
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,720
etc and then you go

637
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
into the approach so of course attack

638
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
vectors made for christmas

639
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,679
or covid doesn't work when kobe is over

640
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,039
or something else is coming

641
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,200
or if it's easter then you're you know a

642
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,400
long way from

643
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,559
christmas phishing emails for instance

644
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,679
and then you exploit

645
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,799
of course further down the line

646
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
when you go into the process of the

647
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,880
attack vector itself you decide

648
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,200
the type of attack vector is it person

649
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,159
based

650
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,799
physical sending someone in talking

651
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,520
someone

652
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,039
or is it technology based cyber then

653
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,720
in the middle the next box is basically

654
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,200
the principle what is your attack vector

655
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
based on

656
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
and that's something you will have in

657
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,840
your company

658
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
maybe people which do not really like to

659
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
engage with the clients or don't want to

660
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,919
travel etc etc so

661
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,559
but you will have mostly you will have

662
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,559
people within your organization which

663
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:42,880
are

664
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,320
exceptionally well at this type of work

665
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
they can work out the details the

666
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,320
principles

667
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,440
so it's a teamwork developing

668
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
uh great attack vectors it's not like a

669
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,679
single person does it so

670
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,520
you select the principle which you see

671
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,039
the time base you put them on the

672
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,120
pressure you're using authority

673
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,240
it's like ceo fraud your scarcity it's

674
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
limited edition it's only available

675
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,960
until

676
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,400
etc etc you decide what principle you're

677
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,360
using

678
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,400
and then also of course you're using in

679
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,320
what information is available

680
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,360
the beliefs the emotional financial of

681
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,039
course the culture comes in

682
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,600
should we really send emails or phishing

683
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
emails based on this or is that maybe

684
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,480
just

685
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
too high risk for instance for our

686
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,840
reputation

687
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,760
then as in normal project management you

688
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,280
have constraints

689
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
we have the time duration and time of

690
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,559
attack how much money

691
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,960
is there available the budget within

692
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,799
which time frame these attack vectors

693
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,320
need to be defined

694
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
the chances of success if you have a

695
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,400
database of your attack vectors you

696
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,799
previously have used you will have also

697
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,039
marked them how successfully they are

698
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,480
or if you are for instance buying

699
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,320
or using professional phishing software

700
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,480
in there sometimes i think i have seen

701
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,679
at least three of them

702
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,679
which have like like this little flag

703
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,799
chance of success

704
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,960
or success and the percentage how

705
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,120
successful this attack vector was

706
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,279
maybe in the past but if you're doing it

707
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,279
yourself you also will map this out

708
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,320
after a while

709
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,960
using which phishing email or attack

710
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,440
vector had a good chance of success

711
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,679
then also of course who is available

712
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,080
within your company to execute this

713
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
uh the skills and also the social

714
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,200
economically

715
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,039
perspective should you do it should you

716
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,440
not do it is this appropriate this is

717
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,279
not appropriate etc

718
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,679
then down comes the most important bit

719
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,440
is the intensity levels i will show you

720
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,799
that just in a minute

721
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,640
and governance risk compliance we will

722
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,840
skip that for today

723
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,240
um that's probably too much of a of a

724
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,000
theory to apply for your

725
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,919
practical use i guess but these are the

726
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,039
boundaries

727
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,840
you should stay within your boundaries

728
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,600
and you should clearly communicate

729
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,480
with your client what the boundaries are

730
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,880
so i was quite interesting when i was

731
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,559
preparing for the for the conference

732
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,039
today

733
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,520
i i was digging out some previous work

734
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,120
and i thought i will show you this one

735
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,080
that was three years ago um an attack

736
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,799
vector

737
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,559
i used it was only executed locally

738
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,880
today would be absolutely impossible to

739
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
use that one

740
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,559
and also we haven't been using it

741
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,120
because it was too high in the intensity

742
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,240
level so

743
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,120
this attack vector was basically a

744
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,720
clipboard as you can see

745
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,400
it was uh used with the sticky tape

746
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,600
to a wall in the bathroom and the letter

747
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,520
says it's actually a copy of the world

748
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
health organization

749
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
it's about hand washing quite quite

750
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,200
macabre for today's means so and it was

751
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,080
basically we

752
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,120
contaminated the bathroom stall doors

753
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,679
with the uv powder and also of course

754
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,720
the taps

755
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,159
and then there was a little hint with

756
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,159
this uv lamp you can then

757
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,240
check basically if your hands are clear

758
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,440
or not and if you want to wash them

759
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,760
and really the the idea was basically it

760
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,799
was baiting

761
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,880
and baiting was done by okay we wanted

762
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,640
to go

763
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
make them click on this link which is

764
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
here login and of course

765
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
the basic means was to confuse them and

766
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,000
maybe scare them a little bit that's

767
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
also why we kind of then

768
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,640
didn't use that attack vector although

769
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,400
with the people i tried it it worked

770
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,480
fantastically so here you see a picture

771
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,559
with the uv lamp actually then

772
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,799
highlighting your hand and of course

773
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,520
everybody's hand would light up on the

774
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
uv light because everybody

775
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,880
everyone was using the the toilet room

776
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,039
stall doors the knobs right because the

777
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,320
knobs we prepared

778
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,000
i will show you that on the next picture

779
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,159
so here you see the ladder again

780
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,360
this patch thingies then the uv lamp

781
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,720
for testing little pencil

782
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,039
and here the uv fluids it's actually

783
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,760
based on a kit for for testing how uh

784
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,360
how virus is spread and this is ink uv

785
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
ink and this is the uv powder so that's

786
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,200
the whole setup of this attack vector

787
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,559
and of course here you think yeah it's

788
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,520
great

789
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,679
it works great as a matter of fact but

790
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,960
it's just too risky

791
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
you can freak out people you can you

792
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,120
know get them into a tantrum whatever so

793
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,440
we

794
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,240
disposed of that one but just that one

795
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,960
would be a

796
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,799
you'll be totally insane if you would

797
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,640
launch something like this today because

798
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,919
i mean of course

799
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,240
success rate would be quite high but at

800
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,159
what price right

801
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,200
so let's go for the intensity levels

802
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,679
and since i'm here and being able

803
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,600
talking to you and actually having quite

804
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,799
fun with that

805
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,399
um i have to say i always was lucky

806
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,120
uh so far but also i was always quite

807
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,279
careful in executing my tasks in

808
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,360
executing the projects i did

809
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,760
and i was working in many places around

810
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,600
the world i was in australia for a

811
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,559
couple of years in china as well the us

812
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,399
and there were situations which you

813
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,080
really need to think

814
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,240
of what are you doing and what are the

815
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
risks and it really depends on your

816
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,840
experience

817
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,320
or maybe on the experience of your team

818
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,919
or your team leader

819
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,039
in which tasks you engage and

820
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,799
there is and you will see tasks which

821
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,399
might not appear right so stay away from

822
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,120
this

823
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,799
because you might want to keep your

824
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,880
security clearance or you might want to

825
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
get one in the future

826
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,320
or you want just to be having the

827
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,880
freedom of working from home and not

828
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,440
from

829
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,080
another place here we just made a little

830
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,360
uh chart uh basically like an and a

831
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
traffic light chart

832
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,240
where we have each attack vector listed

833
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,720
in terms of what it means for risk

834
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,200
management of course green is good

835
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,080
orange is somewhat good if you have to

836
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,320
red you should stay away from and

837
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,000
black ones don't do them it's not worth

838
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,960
the risk

839
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,440
it's totally unnecessary in a corporate

840
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,399
setting

841
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,200
it's maybe for curiosity or some other

842
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,320
things there so

843
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,440
you actually take each attack vector and

844
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,760
you

845
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,200
rate it against this intensity levels

846
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,880
and then also you discuss this with your

847
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
client i did have clients when i was

848
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
doing phishing

849
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,720
initiatives for instance where i did

850
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,520
have to apply this table because

851
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,000
we did fishing couple of thousand people

852
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,559
all around the world etc etc

853
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,000
we figured out some interesting

854
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
connections we figured out for instance

855
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,720
they had

856
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,360
developers in thailand and when we

857
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,399
discussed

858
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,240
the phishing emails and the reporting

859
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
and the geolocation of opening of the

860
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,679
phishing emails of course

861
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,440
we figured out other someone opened the

862
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,039
email in thailand and then we looked

863
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,799
okay what is it where is it

864
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,159
how could that be was it forwarded etc

865
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,399
we don't have any staff in thailand but

866
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
then all of a sudden the cio raised his

867
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,399
hand and said i have a developer down

868
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,600
there

869
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,279
and that was an interesting discussion

870
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,720
to have so

871
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,120
um i think it's important always to make

872
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,960
sure you look at the intensity levels

873
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,000
and what do they mean

874
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,760
and benchmark yourself or your company

875
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,039
or the job you are doing against some

876
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,520
kind

877
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,640
of ethics whatever it is

878
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,399
so what do i mean here is the the chart

879
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,240
with the risk appetite or the possible

880
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,399
consequences it's very easy

881
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,799
if it's legal non-invasive also into

882
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,840
green just go

883
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,399
no approval necessary simple local or

884
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,480
national just go and do it

885
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,880
if you are preserving a person or a

886
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,399
company's integrity

887
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,399
then it's also okay but if you're maybe

888
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,559
compromising a person's integrity

889
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,960
in the work you do because maybe you're

890
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,480
phishing and saying yeah this person

891
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,080
clicked first and

892
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,240
those guys in south america are always

893
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,840
the worst or whatever

894
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,000
be very careful what you're doing there

895
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,559
so then it's no longer green level

896
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,159
orange level is maybe your attack vector

897
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,279
is invasive intrusion medium complexity

898
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,200
it's a well-known corporation ethically

899
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,399
questionable or it's a misdemeanor

900
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,240
and you can check this with some of the

901
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,440
actions clients

902
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,000
asking you so check them check them with

903
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,799
legal

904
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,279
with your team leader with whoever with

905
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,080
the internet

906
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,399
so what is the task you're asked to do

907
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,320
in terms of what could it mean

908
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,360
and always in information security if

909
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,919
you look

910
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,399
how people get charged it's always some

911
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,279
kind of strange law with the

912
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,519
telecommunication

913
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,159
act and whatever and it can be really

914
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,000
bad so for instance

915
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,559
um especially maybe younger ones which

916
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,960
are entering into social engineering

917
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,960
uh tactics or work they think okay like

918
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,240
i build now my own identity uh do now

919
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
like a documentation and maybe make you

920
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,080
know just change a picture of a driving

921
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,519
license or so on

922
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,519
you know it's not a big deal so it

923
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,640
really sometimes

924
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,760
is a big deal so it's falsification

925
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,799
of documents and that can be a felony or

926
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,200
it's no longer a misdemeanor so always

927
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,760
be very careful in what you are engaging

928
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,600
because from a business perspective and

929
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,080
a personal perspective it's not worth it

930
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,000
i use this table to discuss what the

931
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,320
client wants he wants to have a phishing

932
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,080
email done he wants to have maybe

933
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,640
penetration testing done with exploiting

934
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,320
and maybe some social engineering on a

935
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,159
personal basis like

936
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,240
trying to obtain additional information

937
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,760
i always use this table and say look

938
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,840
what you are asking me is orange

939
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,799
i can do it or if i have a task which is

940
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,000
maybe orange

941
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,039
on the border to red i just deny i say

942
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,919
sorry i can't do it i do outsource it

943
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,080
you have to go to another company or

944
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,559
i am using another company to execute

945
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,720
orange tasks for me because i want to

946
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,159
stay in the green

947
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,080
it really depends it's a management

948
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,279
question

949
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,080
so uh just checking the time probably

950
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,600
have to speed up a bit here

951
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,919
let's see what i have else for you you

952
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,039
will get these slides

953
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,720
i think you will get the videos all that

954
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,080
stuff of course

955
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,640
and then i'll just quickly show you what

956
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,679
else is there

957
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,519
from a social engineering perspective

958
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,200
what you're actually looking for

959
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,240
with the practical background so there

960
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,080
i just have knowledge of a certain

961
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,159
report from a team

962
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,880
duplicity with olivia donnheim and chuck

963
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,000
finley

964
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,200
they were at defcon 22

965
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,279
had had assigned the target and actually

966
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,039
went to the conference

967
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,080
a part of scctf social engineering

968
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,039
captured the flag

969
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,279
is you capture the flag but from a

970
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,679
social engineering perspective

971
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,480
so here you can see a little view of

972
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,519
what these flags

973
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,080
are and as i said in the beginning all

974
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,760
information is relevant even the

975
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,640
smallest bit of information is relevant

976
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,240
as with all the tools you have in your

977
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,720
network like you did have maybe

978
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
an intrusion from an ip address or a

979
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,399
connection from the ip address

980
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,679
three months later you have another one

981
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,519
i have forgotten what i had for lunch

982
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,320
yesterday so people are fallible

983
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,399
systems not so with social engineering

984
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,600
it's the same you collect

985
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,079
all this information if i have given out

986
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,199
my phone number

987
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,239
maybe today and giving out my postcode

988
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,480
next week i will totally not correlate

989
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
this so that's what social engineering

990
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,280
is doing

991
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,440
in the background as well so you're

992
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,280
collecting these flags that's

993
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,719
from the report but then also you decide

994
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,079
what this information means and we as a

995
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:28,879
team then

996
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,639
i was with a fantastic woman in

997
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,560
information security

998
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,719
back then teaming up with her and it was

999
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,679
just great

1000
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,520
we had a fantastic time we came up with

1001
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,040
this little scheme here

1002
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,520
so we do have notable events which is

1003
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,399
like okay

1004
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,480
you could do something out of it but

1005
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,440
it's maybe not

1006
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,560
for such a risk then we had an attack

1007
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,040
vector

1008
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,879
a real attack vector defined if the

1009
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,320
information could be

1010
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,119
actually executed and used and also we

1011
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,320
found of course disastrous information

1012
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,440
or bits of information then the whole

1013
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,000
report

1014
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,359
was basically uh based on

1015
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,920
of this information which is actually

1016
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,640
fantastic

1017
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,560
so my blackout bar just moved down

1018
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,040
fantastic lovely i love that but it's

1019
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,560
six years ago so

1020
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,520
we then had information and actually

1021
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,040
looked at it we discovered it

1022
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,960
what is the issue with it what is the

1023
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,599
impact of it and how can you mitigate it

1024
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,599
so we did this with all the information

1025
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,800
we could found

1026
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,680
and we did actually compile uh over 100

1027
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,320
pages report on what could be found

1028
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,599
just from public information without

1029
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,760
actively hacking or entering the

1030
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,720
customer systems

1031
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
information is everywhere i just

1032
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,480
mentioned that so we could

1033
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,599
use information from over sharing on

1034
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,560
foursquare based on this information we

1035
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
could see the type of operating system

1036
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,960
used the type of hardware which has been

1037
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,160
used

1038
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,280
then on the client event there were

1039
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,839
pictures

1040
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,960
shared we could identify how their batch

1041
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,520
looks that's

1042
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,880
with the low res i have a high-res

1043
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,560
picture of that one so we could actually

1044
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,160
would be able to print

1045
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,240
reprint that batch which brought us

1046
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,920
through the first

1047
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,079
the first area i guess then we found of

1048
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,240
course all kinds of social media

1049
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,160
pictures we would then correlate with

1050
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
the people which have

1051
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,480
taken them or which people are on this

1052
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,280
picture

1053
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,200
which then subsequently also could be

1054
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,359
used as an attack vector for

1055
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,640
further exploitation i guess so

1056
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,560
information is everywhere over sharing

1057
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,160
is a big problem

1058
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,880
if information becomes a risk or not

1059
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,800
that depends to be determined

1060
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,880
but i think as a as a social engineer

1061
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,960
it's our tasks

1062
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,160
uh to find its vulnerabilities of

1063
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,720
people or through people and then also

1064
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,760
highlight them

1065
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,040
to the business improve security

1066
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,800
improve the security posture of the

1067
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,440
business and i think definitely now

1068
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,839
today where the world has become really

1069
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,960
complicated

1070
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,200
i do think we need to help each other

1071
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,160
and everyone

1072
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,720
with all these uh phishing emails going

1073
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,240
around now coverage with all these

1074
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,280
applications

1075
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,760
uh people are for the first time uh

1076
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,400
being online maybe work from home

1077
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,920
etc etc i think that was my

1078
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,280
little contribution for the isolation

1079
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,160
