1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,800
[Music]

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,530
so

3
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,619
[Music]

4
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,920
i'm just a bit unsure mike because you

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,399
said

6
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,399
you'd introduce me that's still

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,760
happening absolutely

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,039
so um it delights me to welcome stefan

9
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,520
harger

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,440
who's a great friend of mine uh somebody

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,280
that i've known for a good few years now

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,039
on the information security circuit

13
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,920
um he's going to talk about life from an

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,440
attacker's point of view so

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,719
over to you stephen mike thank you mike

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,519
um thank you for having me uh i want to

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
talk about the attacker's point of view

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,479
that much is true

19
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,439
but actually i want to do it so that

20
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,200
people in the blue team

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
people like myself because i originally

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,400
am very much

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
blue team centric can do something about

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,159
what the bad attackers actually do to us

25
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,520
or maybe we can't do a lot so

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
it should be a really basic talk

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
covering a few topics um a broad range

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,200
of topics but

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,079
maybe none of the topics too deeply if

30
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,159
you are really really interested in that

31
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,560
uh then please go to my twitter i've got

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
a poll running whether you're interested

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,680
in a workshop about that

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,799
and we see where that goes

35
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,920
but without further any things

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,159
a talk like that which deals with

37
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,479
attacking your own company or somebody

38
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,240
else has to come with a disclaimer

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,040
or to be more precise with a few

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,759
disclaimers

41
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,680
so all the stuff i'm going to talk about

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,919
is from a perspective of a defender that

43
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,760
is looking at their own company

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
because that's my role at the moment i'm

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
looking at our company from the outside

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,280
try to identify weaknesses and weak

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
spots from

48
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,520
network level to social media and

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,160
everything

50
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,760
in between and it is very interesting to

51
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,200
see what you can find out

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
about a company and usually

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
you would only do that if you were

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
interested in your own company or if you

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,879
wanted to attack it

56
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,040
because this is the first phase of any

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
successful attack

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
the attacker will probably go ahead and

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
try to figure out

60
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
how to attack you what kind of

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
information can they find

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
for spare phishing emails for any other

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,440
stuff

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
so please bear in mind that

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
everything i show you please just use it

66
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,800
with your own company

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,080
and of course i'm also talking about

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
identifying some secret projects of

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
yours or

70
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,319
maybe finding out interesting

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,400
information about your vips

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,599
and stuff like that and maybe if you

73
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,560
are interested whether some kind of

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,840
information has leaked

75
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,879
about one of your secret projects named

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,959
i don't know rainy unicorn or something

77
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,040
like that then it's a really really bad

78
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,319
idea to put that into

79
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,480
a shady search engine or any website

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,319
that might give you information

81
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,159
never give out any kind of information

82
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,519
that you don't want to

83
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,560
have um publicly available and

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,040
try to be sneaky and try to think like

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,280
an attacker they wouldn't know

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,720
your secrets so um just

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,799
don't give away information freely

88
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
and the next point is one of the points

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,239
where people

90
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,319
regularly laugh when i do that in front

91
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,760
of live audiences or

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
ask them try to have permission from

93
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,159
your company in writing

94
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,959
if you do stuff like that the reason i'm

95
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,680
saying this

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,439
is not because i think you shouldn't

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,920
trust your company of course you should

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,040
but i've had a talk with a few people

99
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,519
and they said that penetration testers

100
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,080
especially

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,478
internal penetration testers very often

102
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,918
have been fired on the grounds

103
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,798
that they did penetration testing which

104
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,960
basically was the job description

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,440
but human resources found it very easy

106
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,479
to fire those

107
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,880
guys if there was nothing written in

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
place that said they are allowed to do

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,360
that

110
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
so try to have some kind of permission

111
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
before you do stuff like that

112
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,919
please it is for your own good

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,560
and of course whatever you are doing you

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,520
should always be

115
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,720
aware of the impact

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,520
of whatever it is that you're doing so

117
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
for example if you try to get into the

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,840
mind of a ddos attacker and

119
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,000
bring down your website and you're very

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,240
happy that you managed that then

121
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
probably if you haven't done that during

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
a scheduled change window

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,039
other people in the company will not be

124
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,479
that happy

125
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,199
so just please bear all those in mind

126
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
and then there's the good question about

127
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,680
why why would you want to do that what

128
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,880
is the reason

129
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,440
why you should put on um the glasses of

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,039
an attacker and have a look at

131
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,800
a really good thorough look at the

132
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
company from the outside

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
well the first point is since

134
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,000
20 25 years whenever companies

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
put their their machines and and linked

136
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,600
them to the internet and made

137
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,160
connected them to the internet there has

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,039
been this question of the parameter

139
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
and protecting the parameter is

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,479
everything but

141
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
since about five seven eight years maybe

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
nobody really has a clue whether where

143
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,160
the parameter is supposed to be

144
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
and my reasoning is this if you have

145
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
no idea what you need to defend

146
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,120
then you can't really do a very good job

147
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,160
defending it

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,039
because even if your protection is is

149
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,440
really good and you think you

150
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,600
thought about everything just check

151
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,479
can't hurt

152
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,639
this is the first part of the motivation

153
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,000
and of course there's always a second

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,479
part

155
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,039
which is sometimes it's really really

156
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,840
funny to think about burning down your

157
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,000
company

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
and i don't mean that in a very negative

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,120
way

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
but if you're thinking about what you

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
could do from the outside

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,280
just to really really be a pain in the

163
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
ass for your company

164
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,479
that can be a lot of fun and of course

165
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,840
you may

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
stumble upon stuff that needs to be

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
patched or that needs to be addressed

168
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,600
detection of course is just

169
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
one part of a really good security

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,080
strategy usually companies

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,199
that are that are bigger that are not

172
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,599
very small are very good with protection

173
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,039
because they've been in this business

174
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,599
for years they've got their firewalls

175
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,400
they've got

176
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,639
everything to secure the parameters

177
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,759
they've got ideas

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,840
ips intrusion detection or prevention

179
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,280
systems

180
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,319
and this is well you can debate

181
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,280
um which is which but most of the

182
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,000
companies are

183
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
really really focused on protection and

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,840
then there is

185
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,759
detection that is what we are going to

186
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,560
talk about in the next few minutes

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,479
and of course there would be reaction as

188
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,759
well these are for me

189
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,759
the three main things that make up a

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,759
very good security strategy

191
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
projection most of us have that covered

192
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:34,880
and

193
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,759
reaction is a little bit harder to do

194
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,240
that is

195
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,599
has to do with processes and probably

196
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,759
stuff that really sounds very boring but

197
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,960
detection can really be

198
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,000
a lot of fun so

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,639
and just to give you an example why i

200
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,800
nowadays think that detection is a lot

201
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,280
more

202
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,520
interesting than just protection i think

203
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
10 or 15 years ago we built up intrusion

204
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,520
detection sensors

205
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,919
for a company i worked i worked for back

206
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,960
then

207
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,639
and i was really absolutely adamant

208
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,440
that there is absolutely no joy in

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,960
putting a sensor

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,360
just outside the firewall facing the

211
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
internet because of course the poor

212
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,400
thing gets attacked

213
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,520
and because back then

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,800
i thought whatever hits it but then hits

215
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,680
the firewall

216
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,000
and can't cross to the internal networks

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
is of no interest it to me because i get

218
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,479
flooded with locks and file alerts and

219
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,679
and alerts

220
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,120
anyway so why would i care about that

221
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,559
nowadays i think a little bit

222
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,399
differently i still wouldn't put

223
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,000
an ids sensor just facing the internet

224
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,399
but

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,320
there's a lot of stuff that we can have

226
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
a look at from the internet

227
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,240
that might be really interesting and

228
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,880
then

229
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,120
don't please please please don't get

230
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,880
lured into the thinking that your stuff

231
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,600
is unhackable

232
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,720
i guess this is proven time and time

233
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
again that this is just a myth

234
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,360
um and that guy in the picture didn't

235
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,519
even eat his own dick so don't believe

236
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,880
him

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
and there's also always

238
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,080
the thought of nobody really is

239
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
interested in our company

240
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,040
again that might be true you might be

241
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,240
really obscure

242
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
and whatever you're doing might not be

243
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,519
of interest to

244
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,560
criminals you think but

245
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
as soon as your company's assets

246
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
are connected to the internet you will

247
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,000
be a target your company will be a

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,959
target

249
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,519
maybe not for your intellectual property

250
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,360
but maybe for your servers your networks

251
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,720
your bandwidth

252
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,440
and other stuff that can be done when

253
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,080
people

254
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
find a way to attack your infrastructure

255
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
and

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,320
carry out more attacks that seem to

257
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,360
originate from you

258
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,440
so people are interested in your company

259
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
to one degree

260
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,600
or to a lesser or bigger degree

261
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,279
one thing we are not going to talk about

262
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,079
in length

263
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,360
here is physical security

264
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
i think it's really funny because just a

265
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
few minutes before

266
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,760
i started the talk i thought to myself

267
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,839
whether physical security nowadays

268
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,920
is easier to achieve or harder

269
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,959
because if somebody breaks in into your

270
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,279
company and is really stealthy about it

271
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,240
will you notice it quicker if there were

272
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,279
people in the office

273
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,640
or if there is just a few

274
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,600
guards around i don't know physical

275
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
security in itself is a really really

276
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
interesting topic

277
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
but i'm not going into that too deeply

278
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,200
here i just have

279
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,160
one small video that shows why it is

280
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,440
interesting to think about that

281
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,760
[Music]

282
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,959
there's this device which is basically

283
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
a wire on a small metal rod that you can

284
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,440
use

285
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,000
like this guy in this video let me show

286
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,360
it to you

287
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
yes in this video the door has a glass

288
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,200
pane

289
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
and he can see everything but basically

290
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,480
this

291
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
is my boss and he did it on the very

292
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,399
first try

293
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,640
and this is just as i said a little bit

294
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,760
of string

295
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,959
a loop of string a wire and a rod

296
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,160
and usually all the offices can be open

297
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,560
from the inside

298
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,680
all right so if you manage to open the

299
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,079
office

300
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,040
from the inside like this guy does then

301
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,240
you are

302
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,240
in the office rooms so

303
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
again very often people say that is not

304
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,720
a problem because we lock everything

305
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
there's nothing on the desk you can't

306
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
take anything away from

307
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,160
from the desks but this is the first

308
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,120
thing you know

309
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,560
where i think people need to start

310
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,120
rethinking security because maybe i

311
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,800
don't want to steal anything

312
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
maybe i just want to bug your office

313
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,000
maybe i just want to

314
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,279
leave something there and what's going

315
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,240
to protect me

316
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,639
protect anybody from from me doing that

317
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,880
so physical security have a look into

318
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,240
that but it's not really

319
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
the focus of this presentation

320
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,440
unfortunately i love doing physical

321
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,279
security i suck at it

322
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,959
um i would so love to

323
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,040
to be good at lock picking and other

324
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,560
stuff but hey

325
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,839
um i'm not

326
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,560
the main thing to think about if you are

327
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
trying to figure out how to attack your

328
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,360
company

329
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
is also to find out who

330
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
would do that in the real world who are

331
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,959
your threat actors

332
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,959
who are the people who are really

333
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,079
focused on

334
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,440
attacking your company so

335
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,240
there are a few answers to that um

336
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
there's

337
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,360
a lot of ways there are a lot of ways

338
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,040
how you could probably put that into a

339
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,079
slide

340
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,120
i put skill as the y-axis

341
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,160
and target as the x-axis

342
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,680
just to make clear what i mean

343
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,560
so ransomware and other attacks like

344
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,279
that

345
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,680
just target everyone if you're

346
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
vulnerable to some

347
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,120
form of attack and people can get in

348
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,600
and can install ransomware then you're

349
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,560
just a target

350
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,240
you know that has nothing to do with

351
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
your company or

352
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,639
whatever field business sector your

353
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,079
company operates in

354
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,200
um absolutely nothing it's just

355
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,720
everybody you're an innocent bystander

356
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,839
as far as targets go then attackers

357
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:36,240
might

358
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
actually target your business sector

359
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,399
that becomes a little bit more

360
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,240
interesting because then

361
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
the attacks will be more focused and

362
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,440
they will

363
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,800
be more sophisticated generally speaking

364
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,480
and of course there are people who might

365
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
attack your company

366
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
specifically very often this is the case

367
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,600
if you have intellectual property that

368
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
is really very interesting or have

369
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,639
something

370
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,680
really really special unfortunately the

371
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,480
people

372
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
specifically attacking specific

373
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,600
companies are

374
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,399
very often also very high skilled so

375
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,760
with the ransomware attacks and

376
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,399
everything

377
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,519
you very often see people who are low

378
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,279
skilled this is not meant as

379
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,279
a derogatory term or anything it's just

380
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,800
for the exploits you can find for the

381
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,760
for new cves the pocs and everything you

382
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,279
don't need a lot of skill to put it

383
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,399
together

384
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,920
so we in the industry used to

385
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,320
call these people script kitties i have

386
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,959
to admit

387
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,000
that sorry i have to get the cat out of

388
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
the picture

389
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,519
um craves attention

390
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,480
i'm a script kitty myself because i

391
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,399
think going to github finding something

392
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,560
that suits my needs and just using it

393
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,440
instead of writing my own stuff is

394
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,040
really really easy and

395
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,079
basically i am a lazy person at times

396
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,839
if i need something very specific that

397
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,399
doesn't exist i write my own tools

398
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,360
but apart from that i'm fine with using

399
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,399
stuff

400
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,600
and so should you be if you try to test

401
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,560
your own company

402
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,399
of course that doesn't mean run any kind

403
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,600
of exploit you find

404
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,320
uh against your company because yeah you

405
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,440
don't really know

406
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
um what it does or what else

407
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
it does to be fair

408
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,040
so and higher up on the level are

409
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,839
nation states and everything and people

410
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,519
that might attack you might not attack

411
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,160
you

412
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,399
but this really depends on your company

413
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,759
if you

414
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,480
really realistically think that some

415
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,360
kind of nation

416
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,160
state or organized criminal gang with a

417
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,079
lot of funds is going to target

418
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,880
your company specifically then hopefully

419
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,240
you have the team and the budget to

420
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,279
defend against that

421
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,880
if not then any kind of reconnaissance

422
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,600
and everything

423
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,279
won't really help you a lot

424
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,959
and there's one kind of attacker that i

425
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,560
didn't especially mention

426
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,959
because it's out not in the focus of

427
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,320
this presentation

428
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,959
and that's the privileged insider who

429
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,519
for me

430
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,240
sits right there in the upper right

431
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,199
corner because

432
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,800
this is the most dangerous attacker you

433
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
could have but again it's it's not the

434
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,279
focus right now

435
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,480
so since this presentation is

436
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,279
just 40 minutes and not a workshop i put

437
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,360
in a few slides for you for later

438
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,440
if you are interested in that some

439
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,639
to-do's um

440
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,320
of course i won't check your homework

441
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,160
it's just a pointer for you if you

442
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,199
really want to

443
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,079
to see more spend some time thinking

444
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,800
about

445
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,680
who might attack you and also think

446
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,240
about

447
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,199
competitors about countries about

448
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,399
whatever you can think about

449
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
do some tabletop exercises about

450
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,920
people who are likely to attack you

451
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,880
because

452
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,120
it's really important that you spend

453
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,199
your budget on stuff that defends

454
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,199
against the threats you're facing

455
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,920
and that's just that's not a box that he

456
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,880
bought at infosecurity that says um

457
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,799
i protect against everything and i do it

458
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,199
with ai and bitcoin mining or

459
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,600
whatever

460
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
so the very very basics that you are

461
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,319
probably all familiar with

462
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,520
are the network layers so

463
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,559
first thing i would suggest is

464
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,319
when you're carrying out attacks against

465
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,480
your own company

466
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,799
use a machine that has internet access

467
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,160
of course but that is

468
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
not connected to your internal networks

469
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,280
in

470
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480
any kind because

471
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,120
you want to take the view from an

472
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
attacker's perspective

473
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,440
and you should be able to do that

474
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,919
and of course if you're using any kind

475
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,960
of

476
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,679
interesting pieces of software you might

477
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,880
infect yourself

478
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,919
or your machine

479
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,000
that you that you use might get porn so

480
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,160
you don't want that to be happening

481
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
use a machine that is not connected back

482
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,799
to your company network

483
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,520
and very important get read access to

484
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
all the relevant log files

485
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
because of course you want to learn from

486
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,679
these attacks right

487
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,760
you want to get to know how these

488
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,400
attacks look when they

489
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,240
are actually actively carried out

490
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,520
against you

491
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,600
and you want to know what to look out

492
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,559
for in

493
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,520
your cm or log file solution or whatever

494
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,559
you have

495
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,039
and you want to create actionable alerts

496
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,679
from that

497
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,240
so you really need to have read access

498
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,320
to the log files

499
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,480
and another really important point is

500
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
that you should be open

501
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,120
in internal communications as well and

502
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,919
you should work

503
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,520
with your colleagues and not against

504
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,960
them because

505
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,880
there's nothing more unfunny than

506
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,080
getting to the crisis room and people

507
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
sitting there since two or three hours

508
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,240
trying to figure out who's attacking

509
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,679
them and

510
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
you just going giggling and saying hey

511
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
that was me

512
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,039
doesn't really work that way and not

513
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,000
really very well

514
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,080
so just play along nicely with your

515
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,000
colleagues they will thank you

516
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and it's better for the whole company

517
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,559
if you've never done it start scanning

518
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,520
your networks

519
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,559
if you only pay pen testing companies to

520
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,000
scan your network

521
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,559
just go ahead and start doing it

522
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,919
yourself

523
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,559
there's so many good tools i'm i just

524
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,360
picked out

525
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,880
two of them that is nmap and mascara

526
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,320
and map of course you can scan not just

527
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
for open ports you can scan for

528
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,520
vulnerabilities like

529
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,240
ssl vulnerabilities like heartbleed and

530
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,760
others

531
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,360
make yourself comfortable with them and

532
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,919
use them on a regular basis if your

533
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,000
networks are a little bit

534
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
larger say you've got more than a class

535
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,679
c network

536
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,039
then also familiarize yourself with mass

537
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,080
can

538
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,960
because this is a way how you can scan

539
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,640
for say a single port

540
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,679
in a very very short amount of time

541
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,840
the interesting thing is whenever a new

542
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
vulnerability comes up

543
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,720
that maybe targets i don't know rdp

544
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,760
or any kind of port then the first thing

545
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
you should do is to scan all your

546
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,039
networks

547
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,640
whether this port is open and check

548
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,000
those machines whether they are

549
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,880
vulnerable

550
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
because basically this is what an

551
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,080
attacker would do

552
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,320
and if you're quicker than the attacker

553
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,000
then there's a small chance

554
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,080
that you get it patched before somebody

555
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,120
abuses it right

556
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,440
yeah and then

557
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,280
scanning is the one thing if you were

558
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
really attacking your company you might

559
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,720
not do it from

560
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,240
your own box right you might use a vpn

561
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,600
or maybe you would actually employ

562
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,559
a specialist with specialists i mean

563
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,159
websites that are going to do the

564
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,520
scanning for you

565
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,480
there are way way more than i just

566
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,640
listed here on the slides

567
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
a lot more and you can find them easily

568
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,799
the ones i've listed on the slides

569
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,919
i hope they are more or less benign they

570
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,720
won't do any

571
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,760
shady stuff but of course i don't know i

572
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,400
can't take any responsibility for them

573
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,679
but the one that may be

574
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,320
a little bit of a challenge for you is

575
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,240
the german one the it experts

576
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,640
well german language it's an austrian

577
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,440
side of course

578
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,320
but this one can do ip version 6.

579
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,200
so far when i talked about scanning very

580
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,080
often

581
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,200
i was just referring to ipv4

582
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
because although ipv6

583
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,360
is really really an adult now i think

584
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,720
it's been around for a lot of years but

585
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,799
it didn't have the kind of impact that

586
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,559
we thought it had

587
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,480
six or seven years ago it's there it's

588
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,919
important it should have the impact

589
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,240
because we are running out of addresses

590
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,840
but scanning ipv6 of course is a

591
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,240
challenge

592
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,799
there's so many more ip addresses there

593
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,640
are also very good talks about how you

594
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,360
can

595
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,360
find any kind of machines that hide in

596
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,320
v6 address space but as i said it

597
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,600
experts dot at

598
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,919
can scan ipv6 address spaces for you

599
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,400
try it out please and then

600
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,440
of course there are the likes of shoden

601
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
and company so

602
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,640
apart from shoden their senses in sumai

603
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
or at least these are the ones that i

604
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,880
have

605
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,039
here in the slides if you have never

606
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,559
heard of shoden before

607
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,600
i can't really imagine you haven't but

608
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,159
if you haven't it is a search engine

609
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:56,799
where you can

610
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,679
easily search for vulnerabilities or for

611
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,360
stuff that is connected to the internet

612
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,720
and has default credentials or

613
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,840
anything that might be a security

614
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,280
problem

615
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,679
you will find on showdown probably you

616
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,600
will also find a lot of honeypots

617
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,480
and stuff that doesn't work and here's

618
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,400
the thing

619
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
you probably will find interesting stuff

620
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,980
if you search for your company

621
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,960
[Music]

622
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,240
please remember the disclaimers and also

623
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,640
please remember local laws

624
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,000
there are enough countries where logging

625
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,280
into

626
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,760
security camera with default credentials

627
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
is already a breach of law

628
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,159
as far as i know the uk and of course

629
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,840
germany are amongst them but

630
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,480
it really depends on where you are so

631
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,400
this is where

632
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,880
the whole have permission in writing and

633
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
just do it for your own company

634
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,080
comes into play census

635
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,520
very often has similar results to

636
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,240
shodhan

637
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,360
but sumai which i believe is

638
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,000
chinese has sometimes very interesting

639
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
results as well

640
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
so just spread out when with your tool

641
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,200
use

642
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
and use several tools tools at once it

643
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,520
might give you very interesting insights

644
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,400
so with all that the sky's the limit

645
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,440
right

646
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,919
no of course it's not um when it comes

647
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,120
to

648
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,679
scanning then you will for example miss

649
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,360
out on all the udp ports

650
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,320
you will not be able to see whether a

651
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,880
udp port is open or not because

652
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,440
that is the whole protocol depending on

653
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,120
the service that it uses

654
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,678
you won't get anything in reply on

655
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,919
tcp is different because you need a

656
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,760
three-way handshake to have a connection

657
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
established but udp you can just send

658
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,080
some

659
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,679
something there and you might not ever

660
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,000
know whether it arrived or not

661
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,240
and of course there's other stuff like

662
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,080
uh services might give you the wrong

663
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
banner might give you the wrong version

664
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,080
there might be some port knocking in

665
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,720
some setups but i don't believe that

666
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,919
will be the case for

667
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,799
professional setups port knocking is

668
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,520
when you

669
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,760
have a demon that is listening to

670
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
packets on every

671
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,039
possible port and maybe if they come in

672
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,159
the right

673
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,360
uh in the right order like port 10 000

674
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,679
port 12 000 port 3000

675
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,279
then it will open up ssh but actually

676
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,760
it's kind of fancy but no serious

677
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,520
business does that

678
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,720
and i hope you don't too

679
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,360
so when you want to take a deep dive

680
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,279
deeper than just finding out the open

681
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,840
ports

682
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,400
then and yes uh

683
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,440
i'm sorry that i used that picture

684
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,640
together with deep dive um but then you

685
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,200
can use

686
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,400
necessary open vas i think it is

687
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,840
uh never know how that is actually

688
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,880
pronounced but those two tools

689
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,520
will actually try a little bit more than

690
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,640
just get a banner

691
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,320
or a connection to any kind of port and

692
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,480
depending on the configuration will try

693
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,400
to abuse whatever service is running on

694
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,520
them

695
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,720
and i'm not saying just

696
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
skip all the pen testing done by

697
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,960
external companies and do it yourself

698
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,400
the reason why you're doing that

699
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,559
yourself is because you can

700
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,200
then have a look at the logs and see how

701
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,760
that all

702
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,159
looks like when an attacker does that

703
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,279
and

704
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,200
try to come up with a with a clever way

705
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,640
of alerting

706
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,360
uh someone when this happens again

707
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,760
there's

708
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,240
nothing you can really do about it but

709
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,039
sometimes it's

710
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,000
interesting to know

711
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,360
and one honorable mention that i just

712
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,240
have to get out there is robtex.com

713
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,440
because if you feed droptext.com just an

714
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,240
as

715
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,919
like our as or address space or whatever

716
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,720
it comes up with this nifty little graph

717
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,400
of how it is all connected

718
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,279
your mail records your mx records your

719
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,240
name servers

720
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,120
your address records and everything and

721
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,039
paints a beautiful picture

722
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,840
and the funny thing is uh the picture is

723
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,039
even more beautiful than

724
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,919
anything the network team has come up

725
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,399
with

726
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,440
so far that i'm aware of so use that for

727
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,600
your own documentation if you want to

728
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,520
try it out please the topics of paste

729
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,559
bins

730
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,880
is also very interesting one if you're

731
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,080
not familiar with them

732
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,480
these are sites where you can just uh

733
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,520
paste anything

734
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,640
that you just copied like amounts of

735
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,039
text

736
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,240
amounts of code and very often

737
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,559
or sometimes well up until now

738
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,720
people have shared breaches and breach

739
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,480
data on pastebins as well

740
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,279
especially pastebin.com which is the

741
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,159
first on this list

742
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,760
which means if any kind of web service

743
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,279
was breached and people got away with

744
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,080
the user database and probably the hash

745
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,039
passwords or the passwords in cleartext

746
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,399
very often people would put it on

747
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,520
pastebin to just put it out in the open

748
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,120
this is or was

749
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,640
really interesting for researchers as

750
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,399
well because

751
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,600
you had access to a scraping api if you

752
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,039
paid for it

753
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,440
and this api would just you know

754
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,720
give you all the pastes that have come

755
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,039
in

756
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,520
for a certain keyword like your company

757
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,080
name or anything and you would be

758
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,320
really really quickly aware if something

759
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
has been shared on pastebin

760
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,440
so the problem is that this week

761
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,000
pastebin decided to scrape the scraping

762
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,039
api

763
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,399
and discontinue it i don't know what's

764
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,640
going to happen with it

765
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,279
i don't know whether there are already

766
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,880
interesting ways to deal with that

767
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
somebody suggested just use google and

768
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,320
in url

769
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,559
google docs but i don't think this is

770
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,000
going to work

771
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,279
and the problem here is that pastebin

772
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,559
is one of the few paste bins where any

773
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,200
user could see any of the pastes there

774
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,919
are

775
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,120
paste bins like clipper io

776
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,760
and i think ghostbin as well where you

777
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,520
can paste but you don't really see the

778
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,240
results

779
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,000
unless you have the link so

780
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,120
with a lot of these things very often it

781
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,919
just gives you

782
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,120
a small degree of detection

783
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,360
but in my opinion if you just detect 20

784
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,240
percent of

785
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,159
something this is still better than

786
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,600
detecting 0

787
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,360
of course 100 or 95 would even still be

788
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,240
way way better but we have to deal with

789
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,279
uh

790
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,840
with whatever we can we can get right

791
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,959
and then there are breaches

792
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,279
so you know have i been pawn.com

793
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,399
i'm not actually questioning that i am

794
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,039
quite aware

795
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,799
that you know about that site if you

796
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,720
don't shame on you

797
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,760
but well no shame not really because

798
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,399
uh it's a white universe but then if you

799
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,840
don't know about that site please check

800
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,640
it out

801
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,480
you can enter your email address and

802
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,320
find out whether this has been

803
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,440
in a recent breach the thing is have i

804
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,840
been pawned and similar sites

805
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,039
to me have one drawback which is

806
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,600
completely totally understandable but

807
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,760
still a drawback

808
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,279
troy hunt the guy behind

809
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,080
haverpinpawn.com

810
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,919
doesn't really give you a lot of

811
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,279
contextual information

812
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,159
so even if the breach had password

813
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:46,720
hashes

814
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,600
or details about the breach they won't

815
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,000
be

816
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,919
really mentioned in have i been pawned

817
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,000
so i can't really

818
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,440
do a lot with that i can still notify my

819
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,080
users

820
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,480
but if i had access to the original

821
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
breach

822
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,840
and maybe hash passwords or passwords in

823
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,640
clear text

824
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,600
i could do a better job in informing my

825
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,399
users

826
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,399
what has been breached because the

827
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,720
problem is rarely the site that has been

828
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,120
breached but its password reuse

829
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,919
if somebody used a certain password for

830
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,960
adobe

831
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,720
and that has been breached there's a

832
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
good chance this person will use the

833
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,159
password for other sites

834
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,760
so that is the real problem with

835
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,679
breaches

836
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,000
if you want to their password let's

837
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,279
lists aplenty

838
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,279
to be found on the internet one of the

839
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,640
most infamous ones

840
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,240
is the rockyou.txt you can find that on

841
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,720
the

842
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,679
second link and you can check passwords

843
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,399
aplenty

844
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,240
against the list of breach passwords and

845
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,080
see whether your users came up with

846
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
really something very good or maybe not

847
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,519
so good

848
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,039
so please be aware of breaches and

849
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,720
whenever you get the knowledge of a new

850
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,760
breach

851
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,240
you really need to react fast have i

852
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,440
been pawned gives you

853
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,080
the option of entering your domain and

854
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,039
being alerted

855
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,679
when users with that domain in their

856
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,559
email address

857
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,720
are breached so go ahead and do that

858
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,039
you need to have access either to the

859
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,559
dns service or

860
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,399
certain email addresses because not

861
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,799
everybody can do a domain search for

862
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,720
any domain you really need to be the

863
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,080
owner of the domain or

864
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,720
know the owner of the domain but this is

865
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,440
a very good thing to do

866
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,240
code leaks do not underestimate stuff

867
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,799
that's

868
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,600
pasted on github or stack overflow

869
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,799
there is stuff on the configurations and

870
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,679
configuration

871
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,960
problems and maybe code snippets maybe

872
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,960
api keys that could be used

873
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,399
to either passively find out about your

874
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,080
infrastructure because maybe one of your

875
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,279
sysadmins posted

876
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,519
a certain configuration problem with a

877
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,840
specific type of software

878
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,559
and this is very interesting to see just

879
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,679
go to these sites

880
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,679
and look for your company look what's up

881
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,760
there and

882
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,279
really really make sure that the

883
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,600
information that is publicly available

884
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,720
on those sites

885
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,320
isn't something that's going to bite you

886
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,120
in the ass later

887
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,240
and one of the nicest things i think

888
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,640
to find out about about breached stuff

889
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,080
or find out about

890
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,640
stuff that is a problem already but you

891
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,000
don't know about it

892
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,360
are sinkholes if you're unfamiliar with

893
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,480
sinkholes usually

894
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,360
when malware probably all the malware

895
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,200
guys will just kill me for that but

896
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,279
i try a simple explanation please bear

897
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,960
with me usually if

898
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,039
malware tries to communicate back to its

899
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,720
command and control server

900
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,799
this command and control server will

901
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,000
maybe hide behind

902
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,960
a lot of different dns names but after

903
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,279
all

904
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,080
it probably will resolve or it sure will

905
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,039
resolve to

906
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,480
one ip or just a handful or five piece

907
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,440
so internet providers are very eager to

908
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,480
work together

909
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,520
with certain organizations and of course

910
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,719
with uh

911
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,800
officials to take down those ip

912
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,960
addresses and sometimes

913
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,800
those benign companies will put a

914
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
sinkhole there so

915
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,440
the idea is whoever command communicates

916
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,800
to that sinkhole

917
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,000
is an infected client or maybe

918
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,599
another command and control server

919
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,760
trying to communicate

920
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,879
with its sibling

921
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,440
this traffic can be analyzed and can be

922
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
very insightful

923
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,760
and funnily enough if you have infected

924
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,719
clients

925
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,159
that want to communicate with a c2

926
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,639
server

927
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,040
and just hit a sinkhole then there is

928
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,719
shadowserver.org and they will

929
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,359
notify you if that is the case if you

930
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,159
register with

931
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,760
shadowserver.org you get a lot of

932
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,079
benefits when it comes to

933
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,200
sinkholes and just

934
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,200
checks for your company regular checks

935
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,680
like

936
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,800
uh whether well

937
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,880
heartbleed again maybe as an example or

938
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,560
whether you have any kind of telnet

939
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,440
ports

940
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,359
and so on and so forth if you're working

941
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,200
for a company and have never heard of

942
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,560
shadow server awk before

943
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,720
please go there and have a look it might

944
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,240
really help you out

945
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,040
and speaking of helping out shadow

946
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,960
server in the united states at the

947
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,760
moment

948
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,240
has a bit of a problem financially wise

949
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,960
because

950
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,240
cisco withdrew its financial support

951
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,440
and they need to find a lot of money in

952
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
a very short amount of time

953
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,839
the european shadow server is at the

954
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:44,480
moment

955
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,599
not affected but it will be i think if

956
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,560
that

957
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,920
takes too long just looking i

958
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
have four minutes left and that's fine

959
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,040
because

960
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,320
we're nearly through the next things

961
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,359
deserve a talk on their own

962
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,760
sometimes like the deep web and the dark

963
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,560
net

964
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,359
how do you search that the answer is

965
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,440
very often

966
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,119
it is too much a job for a single person

967
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,320
or two or three in your own organization

968
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,599
sometimes you will have to

969
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,079
pay for external expertise with that

970
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,560
what you can do are google docs if

971
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,800
you've never heard about them

972
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,160
you can ask google to only show you

973
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,359
documents with

974
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,599
certain features like in url

975
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,680
somewhere in the url this should be the

976
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,040
password file

977
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,280
and in the text should be something like

978
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,200
root

979
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,480
x00 this is a screenshot that i found

980
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,560
just a few weeks ago i shouldn't say i

981
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,160
found it somebody found it

982
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,960
but it's really not a really good

983
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,720
configuration if you see your password

984
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,920
file

985
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,520
on the internet so just play around with

986
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,480
that

987
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,200
the slides will be publicly available so

988
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,320
i hope you

989
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,440
have a look at all these links and

990
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,480
social media nowadays it's i think one

991
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,760
of the last things i'm going to cover

992
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,599
uh it's very interesting to have sock

993
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,880
puppets that

994
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,200
are not associated with your company or

995
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,040
yourself so you can do research on

996
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,200
facebook or on twitter and you can have

997
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,440
um twitter apis and streams

998
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,640
but of course disclaimer um

999
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,079
carefully read through the terms and

1000
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,800
conditions because on these 1000 pages

1001
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,560
of terms and conditions

1002
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
those social media companies very often

1003
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,760
want to make sure that

1004
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,440
you really only register with your own

1005
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,960
name and

1006
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,480
that stock puppets are not allowed so

1007
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,520
decide for yourself whether

1008
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
a breach of the terms and conditions

1009
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
might be worth it or not

1010
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,960
or not

1011
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,359
another way to detect attackers once

1012
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,320
they actually started doing stuff are

1013
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,359
honey tokens

1014
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,640
and anything honey related this is

1015
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,440
another topic

1016
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,960
i could talk at length about and

1017
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,440
in fact i have and this is a shameless

1018
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,320
plug there's

1019
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,760
a steelcon presentation from i think two

1020
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
or three years ago

1021
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,040
about the whole honey in the age of

1022
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,480
cyber thing

1023
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,240
it's way too much to put it in this

1024
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,520
presentation as well if you're

1025
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,400
interested

1026
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,480
i'm also happy to talk about that all

1027
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,400
day long

1028
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,800
but yeah check that one out please

1029
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,359
one more thing that larger companies

1030
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,640
often face are legitimate company sites

1031
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,800
on third party servers

1032
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,320
so without naming names marketing

1033
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,520
departments

1034
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,800
sometimes feel that the process of

1035
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,560
getting a server and a website up and

1036
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,119
running

1037
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,800
the internal it team is just too tedious

1038
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,359
and too slow and so they buy web space

1039
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,520
from somebody else and put up

1040
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,960
company info there how do you find those

1041
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,280
sites because often enough they won't

1042
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,800
tell you about it

1043
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,880
probably because the it team would then

1044
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,640
say please take it down and put it on

1045
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,680
our service

1046
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,800
well the answer is try to

1047
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,359
fire try to google for the legitimate

1048
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,079
disclaimers

1049
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,520
for the for the disclaimers that you

1050
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,599
have and any legal stuff

1051
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,280
because this is usually a little bit

1052
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,040
different and of course your vip names

1053
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,240
if you have

1054
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,520
to state who the ceo is on your uh

1055
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,839
websites and then the marketing team

1056
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,280
will do that as well

1057
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,520
and just have a look at that and try to

1058
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,040
rein them in because you can't really

1059
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,920
protect what's

1060
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,280
running on somebody else's server

1061
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,839
the same is with web anomalies you could

1062
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:52,480
always

1063
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,680
try and check whether all the stuff that

1064
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,720
is online

1065
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,400
and pretends to be your server is really

1066
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
just the website that you put on the

1067
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,920
server and that it's not some

1068
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,079
malicious injected javascript code by

1069
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,760
somebody who breached your server all

1070
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,359
along

1071
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,520
this is very often very well hidden from

1072
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,400
the inside

1073
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,680
and you could just take a snapshot

1074
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,280
of your website from the outside and try

1075
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,720
to compare it with

1076
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,920
whatever the web team thinks

1077
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,240
is the correct website and try to figure

1078
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,680
out whether there are any kind of

1079
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,720
javascript

1080
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,880
artifacts and anomalies that you don't

1081
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,079
want there

1082
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,040
and again stefan sorry stefan i know we

1083
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,440

1084
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,240

1085
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,359
hard stop

1086
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,359
unfortunately because we've got a

1087
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,800
schedule that we're trying to keep quite

1088
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
tight

1089
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,560
