it's been an awesome day of talks so far

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
um the gofundme page is via the many

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
hats club twitter if you go and check

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,800
that out i think we're four pounds away

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,079
from 7 000

13
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,840
which is incredible somebody can get us

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,440
over that seven grand in the next half

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:45,920
hour

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,320
otherwise i will get my wallet out again

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,480
um coming up soon we've got uh it tucker

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
tanya she hacks purple and james bohr

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,239
but for now over to sulphur the floor is

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,680
yours

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
hi there hi all i'm going to speak to

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
you today about instant preparedness

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,079
or helping a low maturity organization

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,680
on a tight budget

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,479
so who am i well i'm a 24 7 security

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,080
operations center manager

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,640
nearly 10 years in security always team

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,360
blue

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,159
raft of letters after my name fun fact

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,759
started my career as a broadcast

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,400
journalist

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,759
and if you couldn't tell from the slides

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,000
i am a fan of the lovecraft mythos

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
and this is my first talk so be kind

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
so instant preparedness in my opinion

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,759
this is the most valuable thing

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,000
any organization can do it can cost

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,079
nothing to make all the difference

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,079
with being prepared when an incident

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,920
occurs you will know how to use your

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,640
tools

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,520
what actions to take when to take them i

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,799
really like this quote

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,560
i think it sums up quite well i mean you

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,640
can have the best instant responders in

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,439
the business

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,520
but without direction they will not be

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
instant ready

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,960
so we're going to get instant ready and

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,320
how we're going to do that well we're

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,000
going to assess our maturity we're going

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
to bring in some stakeholders

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,960
we're going to play some dungeons and

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,399
dragons and we're going to run some

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,439
simulations

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
if you do all four of them you'll be

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
incident ready

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
so assessing your instant response

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,799
maturity

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,598
so first of all we need a maturity model

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,200
now a maturity model

62
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
is a tool that will help you assess the

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
current effectiveness

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,360
of your organization in whatever goal

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,879
you're attempting to do

66
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,440
it'll also tell you what you need to do

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,000
to order

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120
to level up so if you were to go to a

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
maturity model shop

70
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,959
to get one of these maturity models

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,239
there's a few caveats

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,319
number one all maturity models need to

73
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,560
be designed around your organization

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,319
you need to tweak it you need to adjust

75
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,920
it so none of them will perfectly

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
reflect your organization so be prepared

77
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,319
to put in

78
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,599
some work there caveat to pick a time

79
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,800
frame

80
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
set yourself a period of time to use

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,920
this maturity model

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
i'd recommend probably about three years

83
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,680
and assess every year

84
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,760
and caveat free understand the problem

85
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,280
you're trying to address

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
so in this space we're going to be

87
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,360
looking at instant preparedness and

88
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,239
instant response

89
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,519
so a maturity model that i like to use

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,159
or

91
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,640
retrofit a maturity model out of is the

92
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,959
national cyber security center's caf

93
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,200
framework the cyber assessment framework

94
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,080
it's developed by

95
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,400
ncsc and it's used as a way to measure

96
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,760
if an organization is

97
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,560
adequately managing cyber security risks

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,120
it is a

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,959
baseline for all cni providers

100
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,560
now the caps made up of several

101
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
objectives you've got objective a

102
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,959
managing security risks objective c

103
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,040
detecting cyber security events

104
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,440
but for our maturity model for incident

105
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
preparedness we're going to focus on

106
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,680
objective d minimizing the impact of a

107
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,080
cyber security incident

108
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,319
and if you drill down into objective d

109
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,519
you have five

110
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,799
subcategories you've got d1a

111
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,519
response plan you've got d1z testing and

112
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,720
exercising

113
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,120
d2b using incidents to drive

114
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
improvements

115
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,799
so each of these kind of sums up

116
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,000
which areas you need to kind of focus on

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,680
and if you drill down into these a

118
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,439
little bit more you'll get

119
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,080
what you call these statements and

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,480
they're

121
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,760
they're split into kind of three

122
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,280
categories that you've got a not

123
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
achieved statements

124
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,798
partially achieved statements and

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,238
achieve statements

126
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,798
so for example your company might not

127
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,560
have an incident response plan in which

128
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,759
case you're firmly in that

129
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,880
not achieved you might look at that

130
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,720
achieve column and say actually we do

131
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
have a response plan which is based on

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
clear understanding of our risks to

133
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,919
network

134
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,360
and they're around our essential

135
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
functions and when i look at

136
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
these kind of table of not achieved and

137
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,240
achieved i see gap assessment fuel

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,199
now gap assessments are really easy to

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,320
do

140
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,919
what you do is you take your current

141
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
situation and you pop it down in one

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
corner and then you go to your future

143
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
for outcomes that's what you want to

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
achieve

145
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
pop it in the other side and then you

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,479
work your way backwards

147
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,960
so for example if you wanted a response

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,320
plan to cover all your essential

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,199
functions

150
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
the first thing you probably want to do

151
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,800
is document them all

152
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,240
then you want to map your threats to

153
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
your essential functions and then you

154
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,840
want to draft response plans

155
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,000
for those critical assets based on the

156
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,080
likely threats and impacts

157
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,160
now then you actually have to go and do

158
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
the hard work and it is hard work

159
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,880
drafting these response plans

160
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,560
but once you've done it once you've done

161
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,880
the grunt work i'd recommend reporting

162
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
it up to your senior management

163
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,759
using your maturity roadmap you know

164
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
which of those assessments where you

165
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,960
weren't achieving

166
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
and what work you've done to make it so

167
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,479
that your company now achieves it

168
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,960
and then report that up uh give it to

169
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,080
management management

170
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,960
love it when they see good percentages

171
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,639
increasing the show that the hard work

172
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,840
you've been doing

173
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,960
is recognized so

174
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,039
to kind of summarize that you've got to

175
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,800
understand the problem first

176
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,120
you know speak to people about what they

177
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
see their problem is in for instant

178
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,240
response

179
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,319
you've got to pick the caf objectives

180
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,199
remember not all caf objectives apply

181
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,199
and you can add additional ones your

182
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,280
organization is unique so treat it as

183
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
such

184
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
create a gap assessment really easy to

185
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,800
do and it will help set out a roadmap

186
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
for the next period

187
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,280
then work on bridging that gap that's

188
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
where hard work comes in

189
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
but spend time do it well and then

190
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,560
report on success

191
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,319
management love successes make sure you

192
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,000
give them the good news

193
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,080
so once you've done that we can talk

194
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,360
about bringing in key stakeholders

195
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,240
so you've done your maturity model

196
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
you've created a

197
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
response plan you've disseminated it out

198
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,639
to your stakeholders

199
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
the next thing you want to do is test

200
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,840
that response plan

201
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
and it needs to be tested at a high

202
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
level as well as a low level

203
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,440
that's to ensure that a your bosses have

204
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
confidence in your team

205
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
dealing with an incident and that your

206
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
response plan satisfies your stakeholder

207
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,639
needs during an incident

208
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,199
the best way to bring those points out

209
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,280
is to do a tabletop exercise

210
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,759
a few caveats here you have to do a

211
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,400
tabletop

212
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,880
exercise with a process to test if

213
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,520
you're bringing

214
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
a half written process or no process to

215
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,880
the table

216
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
it's not worth your time it'll make you

217
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
look bad don't do it

218
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,880
caveat two ensure all your stakeholders

219
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,520
are present

220
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,120
and if they can't be present make sure

221
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,919
they're informed

222
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,039
so for those who don't know a tabletop

223
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,240
exercise

224
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
is really just a discussion based

225
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
session where we sit round a table

226
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,479
we discuss the roles during an emergency

227
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,080
and the responses that each

228
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
kind of team would take due to a

229
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
particular dire situation

230
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,240
and here's a couple of tips i've learned

231
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
so as i said before

232
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,680
have an incident management process to

233
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,840
test that's really important

234
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
tip two pick a scenario that is relevant

235
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,039
to the business

236
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,039
you know you're getting your your boss's

237
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,319
mates in a room here

238
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
you don't want to waste their time by

239
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,360
going for a zombie apocalypse

240
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,720
you want to make sure it's relevant to

241
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,800
that business tip three

242
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,000
avoid being too technical while you it's

243
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,840
really easy to get stuck in the weeds in

244
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,199
a technical conversation

245
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,680
you might think it's you know it's

246
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,039
succeeding or

247
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,479
working to a goal it won't be

248
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,240
your goal here is to test your response

249
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,560
plan at the high level

250
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,319
uh tip four minute it your whole

251
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,280
tabletop exercise is trying to find the

252
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,360
kinks in your response plan

253
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
and whenever someone brings up an issue

254
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,800
you want to write that down

255
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
you want to be able to go back and

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,839
address that issue so

257
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,479
really do minute and have a facilitator

258
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,320
we'll get on to why a facilitator is

259
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
really important

260
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
and tip five when you have everyone in

261
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,958
that room then

262
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,279
there's the best time to establish group

263
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
with these individuals to follow up on

264
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,080
that exercise

265
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
so there might be some actions that fall

266
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
out with it get the stakeholders in a

267
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
room to agree then

268
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,240
and there that they're going to help fix

269
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,399
it

270
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,680
so i mentioned that the facilitator's

271
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,399
role was key to finding those kinks

272
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
so firstly when you're doing these

273
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
tabletop exercises you'll be going

274
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,640
through the incident

275
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,480
and a facilitator will inject prompts

276
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
into it and and these prompts are based

277
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,480
on a the knowledge of the business

278
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
and best practice when you combine the

279
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,080
two of those

280
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,240
it will really test that response plan

281
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,760
and your assumed

282
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,320
knowledge of that business so for

283
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,880
example when a facilitator asks

284
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,959
are documents received for an email

285
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,640
opened in protective mode

286
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,279
they're asking that because a it's a

287
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:35,680
best

288
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,120
practice due to this controls b the male

289
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
team's also participating on that

290
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,399
exercise and c

291
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,200
we know that the organization uses o365

292
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
so it's very relevant to us

293
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,360
the best thing is all of these prompts

294
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,080
are actually

295
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,720
actions which will address a kink in

296
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,920
your plan

297
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,240
so you know prompt number one would the

298
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
mail team be able to block an email

299
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,000
based on a subject line

300
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
if the people in that room don't know

301
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,000
that's fine just assign an action

302
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
out to a particular team or a

303
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,200
stakeholders team

304
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
to can we actually find that out because

305
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,720
i'm relying on that in my response plan

306
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,279
and each prompt every action and then

307
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,800
once you've done all those actions and

308
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,519
you've got all those

309
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
answers publish those results your

310
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,680
instant response plan should be

311
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,519
available to everyone who needs to have

312
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,079
it

313
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,360
so put it out there and put out the

314
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,680
results of your tabletop exercise

315
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
you know objective we tested our instant

316
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
response process for a large scale male

317
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,480
campaign

318
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
result there's a little bit of confusion

319
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
as to which team would be responsible

320
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,519
for sending out

321
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,160
the all staff comms the action well i

322
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,399
went ahead and i made a racy matrix

323
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,920
which was added to that response plan

324
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,760
which outlines who is responsible for

325
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,120
comps

326
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,959
and again push that out so your

327
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,160
management know you're doing good stuff

328
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,880
so summarize you had a maturity model it

329
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,079
said you needed a response

330
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,320
plan you wrote a response plan you sent

331
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,680
it around for comments

332
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,200
then you got all your stakeholders

333
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
together and you tested out that process

334
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
you had a few issues you work out the

335
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,680
kinks and then again

336
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,000
reporting your success management loves

337
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,480
success

338
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
once you've done that then you can go

339
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,079
and play some dungeons and dragons

340
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,519
so how do you know that your instant

341
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,680
response teams will be able to follow

342
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,399
the instant response plan now you've

343
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,000
just written a very high level piece and

344
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,079
now you've got a low level piece of each

345
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,800
step

346
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,120
your instant responders are going to do

347
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,399
what you need to do

348
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,399
is you test them individually the

349
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,000
cheapest way to do that is to play some

350
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
d and d with them

351
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,959
so you're going to be the dungeon master

352
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,079
and you're going to sit down your

353
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,680
instant responder and you're going to

354
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,480
give them

355
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,279
kind of questions and answer rounds like

356
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,720
they're

357
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,839
a creature in a dungeon you're literally

358
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,639
gonna say

359
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,440
right you've walked into the room how

360
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,240
would you solve

361
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
scenario x what would you do so pick a

362
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
realistic scenario

363
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,480
for example uh phishing email sit down

364
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
and then go to town on that instant what

365
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,399
you want to do is draw up every correct

366
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,920
answer that your team should do

367
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,880
for that so every tool you have that can

368
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,000
be used to

369
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,120
help you solve a phishing incident then

370
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,440
off the back of that create artifacts of

371
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
doing the correct action

372
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,760
so for example if someone said well i'd

373
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,079
check

374
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,760
open source intelligence on that

375
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,000
pre-prepare an artifact of open source

376
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,680
intelligence so you can provide them

377
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
with those results

378
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,560
break down the incident into phases so

379
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,000
make it aligned to the

380
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,639
phases of instant response and then

381
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,760
score the actions

382
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
some actions are more important and then

383
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,519
step six

384
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,399
play out the scenario so this will help

385
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,839
explain what i mean

386
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,639
so you sit your analysts down and you

387
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,160
give them a phishing email and it might

388
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
look like that

389
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,639
and then you ask that analyst right what

390
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,440
would you do

391
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,880
when a user reports that they have

392
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
received this email

393
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
and you give them some time to look at

394
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,720
the email and then you can come back and

395
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,839
say

396
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
right what would you do

397
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
and hopefully they'll go through the

398
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,560
actions they would take

399
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
and then you can score those actions so

400
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,639
you can say right well

401
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,079
did you create a ticket if you did great

402
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,440
here's your artifact of having an

403
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
incident number and two points

404
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,680
did you give a priority on that ticket

405
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,560
oh you did

406
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
you gave it high for a quite an obvious

407
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,600
spam

408
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,399
i'm gonna give you minus one points what

409
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,399
category was the ticket spam great i

410
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,160
love mi

411
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,519
and you go through it and you keep

412
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,040
asking them what else would you do what

413
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
else would you do what else would you do

414
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,560
and you you tried to bring them on track

415
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,959
so if if they say well i'd go and grab

416
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,079
the email header

417
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,320
and then i'd go and analyze it and get

418
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,800
the subject line and send them recipient

419
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
and then i'd go and search for that on

420
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,880
our mail gateway see if any other emails

421
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,519
being sent through just stop them say no

422
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
yeah you're at this stage of the triad

423
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,680
phase all i'm after is what you do in

424
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,199
this round don't worry there'll be other

425
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
rounds later where you can go and take

426
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,120
that

427
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
email artifacts and do your searches

428
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,839
and you go through each phase and then

429
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,519
you might go to the next phase for

430
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,480
example

431
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,680
which might be right well that url no

432
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,040
goes to an

433
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,959
o365 fake login page

434
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,399
what would you do now and again you keep

435
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,000
asking them what would you do what would

436
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
you do what would you do

437
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
until you get to the end of all their

438
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
responses and

439
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
what i really like doing uh it

440
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,720
why i really like doing this activity is

441
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,399
because your analysts will

442
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,760
be thinking on their feet and they may

443
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,639
come up with a solution or a response

444
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,279
task

445
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,120
that you might not afford that might

446
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,480
actually be better

447
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,079
than the response tasks you've thought

448
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,920
of you know what you can do you can take

449
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,440
that and you can add it to your instant

450
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,480
response plans

451
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,839
and then you have a better instant

452
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,560
response process off the back of it

453
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
and again you know test and test for

454
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,560
level of detail

455
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
so did they search for internet access

456
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,399
logs to that site

457
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,160
if they said yeah great give them you

458
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,760
know say a hundred people visited that

459
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,199
site here's the artifact

460
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,600
and i'll give you two points but did you

461
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,440
notice that the site was unencrypted

462
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,800
and that you could actually search for

463
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
http posts

464
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,000
and that way you would actually know

465
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,279
which users have entered their

466
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,959
credentials into it

467
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,279
if so you did clever analyst here's 10

468
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,000
points

469
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,839
did you enter honeypot credits great

470
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,040
here's five points

471
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,399
let's see if you do something with that

472
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,120
later and again you go through and every

473
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,399
time they say they do

474
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,040
an action you give them an artifact or

475
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
the results of it

476
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
and again they might do something that's

477
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,240
bad they might click on a link they

478
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
might investigate the site in an unsafe

479
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,040
manner

480
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,800
in which case negative points some

481
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,160
actions are worse than

482
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,360
actually correct actions

483
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
and what you do is you go through each

484
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
phase so the trial actually analyze to

485
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,079
contain it and recover

486
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,800
what i like to do is start with a really

487
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,839
you know benign

488
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,160
spam email and work its way up to

489
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,880
actually this led to an o365 fake login

490
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,600
page in which

491
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,279
a thousand of our users enter their

492
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,519
credentials and we need a major incident

493
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,079
call

494
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
i like to play the role of the bad boss

495
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,519
in the major incident

496
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,000
call and hammer analysts say what would

497
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
you do what would you recommend

498
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,600
are we blocking the analysts uh are we

499
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,120
blocking the people who clicked on it

500
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,880
are we blocking the people who uh

501
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,759
in the details and then you go each all

502
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,480
the way through

503
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440
all the way to actually recover and this

504
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,000
whole

505
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,360
session shouldn't take longer than an

506
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,079
hour and the best thing about it is at

507
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,320
the end of it once you've scored them up

508
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,199
you can actually put together a nice

509
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,079
pretty graph

510
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,880
about how your teams were doing so for

511
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,160
example

512
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,639
you could look at this and say wow shift

513
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,560
one did really well

514
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
oh sorry shift four did really well

515
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,400
shift one didn't do too well

516
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,559
what i might do i'll swap that team up a

517
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,000
bit

518
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,439
or you might look at it and say you know

519
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,039
what i'm pretty good at recovery

520
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,439
all my teams knew what to do they've

521
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,359
kind of failed on containment though

522
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,559
so i'm going to go back to my

523
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,640
documentation and i'm gonna

524
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,480
you know look at that see if i can

525
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,400
improve upon it and then when i rerun

526
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
this test in six months time

527
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,559
hopefully they'll get better scores and

528
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,439
again

529
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,000
if they do get better scores show it to

530
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
your senior management say look

531
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,679
my guys have got better now at following

532
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,520
instant response processes they're now

533
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,320
hitting nearly

534
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,200
80 of everything they should be doing

535
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,919
for an instant

536
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,760
so

537
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
so the next thing you want to do is a

538
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
cyber simulation

539
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,880
so you've got your maturity model

540
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,360
you've got a process in place you've got

541
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,880
stakeholder buying because of your

542
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
tabletop exercise

543
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
you've got your analysts ready because

544
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,840
you've tested them in that d

545
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
scenario the next thing you want to do

546
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
is a real life test and as mike tyson

547
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,960
eloquently

548
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
put it everyone has a plan until they

549
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,640
get punched in the mouth

550
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,799
so you're gonna now need to punch people

551
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,240
in the mouth

552
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
the way you do that is with cyber

553
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,600
simulations you make them

554
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,720
as realistic as possible if you can

555
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,200
get your red teams involved make as much

556
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
use as the technology will allow

557
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,799
if you've got technical people who can

558
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,799
help get them involved

559
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,799
now this is very technical as opposed to

560
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,240
tabletop exercise

561
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,320
so what you should do is avoid senior

562
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,240
management involvement

563
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,160
let them know that you're testing but

564
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
that is very much aimed at the technical

565
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,360
level

566
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
you want to operate in a no-fault

567
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,480
environment so that when gaps do appear

568
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,840
teams are encouraged to think on their

569
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,000
feet and it's great if gaps appear

570
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,160
because that outcome will be better

571
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,280
documentation

572
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,360
potentially new rule sets and

573
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
potentially

574
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
new business opportunities

575
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,280
so some of the ways you can do a cyber

576
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,600
simulation

577
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,160
is like i said you can get a internal

578
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,960
team

579
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,679
you know be it purple team fret hunting

580
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,559
red teaming

581
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,240
whoever you can with technical skill

582
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
sets you can emulate an adversary

583
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,960
or you can go and get a product based

584
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,440
offering

585
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,559
be an atomic red team or you can pay for

586
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,520
it

587
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,640
but what i like to use is a simulation

588
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
from ncsc's exercise in a box

589
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,400
what that is is it's just a script that

590
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
causes beaconing to a server every 10

591
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,520
seconds

592
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
kind of emulates a c2 beaconing out your

593
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,080
network what i like to do is i go find a

594
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,720
randomer on the floor and i say hi

595
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
i want you to run this script from your

596
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
machine i want you to sit somewhere

597
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,480
where you don't normally sit

598
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,080
and so they go off for an hour and sit

599
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,559
somewhere else and then what i do is i

600
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,440
i go grab my analysts and say look we've

601
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,120
got beaking on your network

602
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
i want you to find out what's beaconing

603
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,360
i want you to go

604
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,480
grab you know grab that information then

605
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
i want you to go find out the physical

606
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,240
location of it and i want you to grab

607
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,840
the machine that's doing the beginning

608
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
and bring it to me and you've got to do

609
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,120
it in under an hour

610
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,039
that's a really cool test to do because

611
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,880
it makes your analysts think you know

612
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,799
what

613
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,919
hey how am i gonna link beaconing

614
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
from you know my network to actually

615
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,280
finding it physically in here

616
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,720
and they have to put their heads

617
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,240
together and think actually the wi-fi

618
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,400
access points might give it away the ip

619
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,240
the internal ip location and they can

620
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,320
work it out and it's a great little hunt

621
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,880
and of course report on those results

622
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,559
give it a cool name like operation

623
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,520
trench stone management love cool names

624
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,600
you know to state what it was about we

625
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,440
aim to test the blue team response to

626
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,720
ransomware

627
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
state your achievements look four out of

628
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
five of my teams were able to resolve

629
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
this incident in under an hour

630
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,960
that's fantastic and five new alerting

631
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,640
use cases have been created off the back

632
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,840
of this operation

633
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,400
even better and you've got one new

634
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,720
opportunity to implement saw for faster

635
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
instant response

636
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,159
great well you've already got instant

637
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,240
buy-in uh stakeholder buy-in because

638
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,919
your tabletop exercise

639
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,360
and people are believing you're working

640
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,159
well so if they've got confidence in you

641
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,039
when you say

642
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,559
i have a new opportunity for them

643
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,679
they'll happily spend that money

644
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,200
so to summarize instant preparedness in

645
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,080
my opinion

646
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
is the most valuable thing any

647
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,000
organization can do

648
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,919
it can cost you nothing and it will make

649
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
all the difference

650
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,159
you do it by knowing the business

651
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,159
running maturity gauging activities like

652
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,520
matching to a framework

653
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,400
and speaking with key stakeholders then

654
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
you test at the high level with key

655
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,360
stakeholders

656
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,280
this is a tabletop exercise where you

657
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,760
ensure everyone knows what processes are

658
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,240
needed

659
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,039
and what their roles and

660
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,520
responsibilities are and then

661
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,280
you drill into the low level detail of

662
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,640
instant responders

663
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,799
you spend time you test out those

664
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,000
incidents you

665
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
make sure every tool is used you make

666
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
sure that you couldn't do anything more

667
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
in that instant response plan you make

668
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,919
sure it's all documented

669
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,320
and all your response teams know how to

670
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,440
do everything

671
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
and then you test as close to real life

672
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,440
as possible and you see where

673
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,280
the theoretical doesn't match up with

674
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,840
reality and if you do all of that

675
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,559
hopefully you'll be instant ready thank

676
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,919
you that's my talk

677
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,600
if there's any questions please let me

678
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,280
know

679
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,520
awesome thank you so much if that was um

680
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,120
if that was your first ever talk i'm

681
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,320
not sure i believe you because that was

682
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,760
fantastic some really great content

683
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,480
there and

684
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
um there's been some great feedback

685
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,760
there on the twitch channel as well

686
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,960
there's a couple of questions we might

687
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
be able to sneak both in if we're fairly

688
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,520
quick so

689
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,720
um first off uh when you have bad news

690
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,480
how do you present it to a customer with

691
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,320
little to no knowledge in the subject

692
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,480
matter

693
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,840
when you have bad news how do you

694
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,600
present it to a customer um

695
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,260
so probably gently

696
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,679
[Laughter]

697
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,360
so you know that customer because

698
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,880
there's a little knowledge of

699
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,360
what's what you're doing for them uh

700
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,600
that that's actually probably your fault

701
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,960
you know you need to educate

702
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,640
the people about what you're offering

703
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,320
them if they think they're getting a

704
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,159
great service from you

705
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,320
and in reality it's just a log and vlog

706
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,280
shop then

707
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,679
you know that that's at your fault you

708
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,799
need to highlight that

709
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,880
so that when it comes down to you being

710
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,559
open and honest about the service

711
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,400
and you have bad news that you know

712
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
we've been breached

713
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,640
uh there's always a silver lining to it

714
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,360
right

715
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
so you know we've been breached but we

716
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,640
were ready for it and

717
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,799
if you if another company or another

718
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,480
instant response team was in place it'd

719
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,760
be far worse

720
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,919
so try to look for the positives and be

721
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,039
open and honest with them

722
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,799
cool fantastic and just one more than

723
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,240
for for the last couple of minutes

724
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,520
what's the best way for a threat

725
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,679
intelligence team to provide support to

726
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,480
an incident response team

727
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,240
okay so it

728
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,159
what the threat intelligence team should

729
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,679
be doing should be looking

730
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,039
at generating what you'd call a

731
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,720
intel so you're they're shoring up your

732
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,840
uh seam alerts they're going out and

733
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,960
getting the latest

734
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,799
and making sure the most relevant threat

735
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,799
intelligence providing that to your

736
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,880
teams and that should be bau

737
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,200
then during an incident they should be

738
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,360
sitting next to your instant responders

739
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,760
ready to run searches on any artifacts

740
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
you've discovered during an incident

741
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,960
so be it let's let's say there's a file

742
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,880
hash you want them looking across all of

743
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,360
their sources for that hash of that file

744
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,000
or it might be some beaconing or it

745
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,440
might be you know what this is a tool

746
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,480
what potentially

747
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,960
actors are there or just other stuff

748
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,919
like you know what

749
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,880
we're not a massive organization we we

750
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,159
probably won't be hit

751
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,480
out of you know we'll be here like most

752
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,000
people in the mass

753
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
mail campaign so let's see what other

754
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,919
companies are chatting about let's see

755
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:56,400
if

756
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,320
other people are suffering from this

757
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,600
incident and let's see if there's any

758
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,679
solutions to it

759
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,080
so it two things really that that

760
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,200
preparation side

761
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
and then actively side by side with your

762
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,320
instant response

763
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
