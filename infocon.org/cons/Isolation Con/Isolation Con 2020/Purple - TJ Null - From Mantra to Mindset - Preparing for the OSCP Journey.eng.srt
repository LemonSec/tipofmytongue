69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,360
a lot of big things i've been doing in

70
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,879

competitions i've done at least 245 in

72
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,959
the past five years

73
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,160
and i also like hosting cyber

74
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,920
competitions for all ages wherever they

75
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,560
are

76
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
just so they can get into cyber security

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
or have an interest or peak in it

78
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
um also like attending uh security

79
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
conferences moderate some communities as

80
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,120

club

82
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,040
but outside of infosec because you have

83
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,959
to have hobbies outside right of doing

84
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,440
all cyber and anything infosec wise is i

85
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,760
we're gonna talk about the course

96
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
prerequisites overview the course what

97
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,360
the new lab environment is like what the

98
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,959
new course material is like

99
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,440
um also some tips for the exam also how

100
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
to prepare for it

101
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,319
and tips of when you are taking as well

102
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,760
too and then some resources that i've

103
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
prepared along the way as well too to

104
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,400
help you on your journey

105
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
and any uh questions or answers we have

106
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,599
after talk we can definitely talk about

107
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,720
that

108
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
so for some of you what is the oscp

109
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,920
right so the

110
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,519
offense security certified professional

111
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,800
is one of the most technical and most

112
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,319
challenging certifications

113
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,599
for information security professionals

114
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
that is out there in order to be

115
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
certified you actually have to take

116
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,120
the penetration testing with cali course

117
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,400
and also

118
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,560
take a 24-hour exam during that 24 hours

119
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
if you go ahead and actually score them

120
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
the amount of points you also have to

121
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,799
write

122
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,400
a report as well too after that 24 hours

123
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
so it's a big certification i think if

124
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
you're trying to get into pen testing

125
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
uh or into infosec and i think it's also

126
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,720
good that even blue teamers like sock

127
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
endless intersponders instant handlers

128
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,319
should also be able to take this course

129
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,920
as well too to get understanding of

130
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,519
what hackers do how to be able to build

131
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,920
that hacker mindset as well too

132
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,360
so why did i pursue oscp

133
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,959
when i was a senior in high school i was

134
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,159
taking a lot of computer classes

135
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,120
actually

136
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,239
we had this school here called the

137
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,480
career technology center and

138
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,080
in that center they actually gave us

139
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,599
gave me my first ever security class

140
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,959
which i ever learned

141
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,319
and one of the things that they dropped

142
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,360
on my desk was a backtrack 5 cookbook

143
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,238
written by william pritchett and also

144
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,000
the backtrack 5r3 cd

145
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and so that was our learning material

146
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
basically and i went through the book

147
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,199
and i went through the cd you know just

148
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,320
learning all the different tools the

149
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,919
techniques the methodologies and i

150
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,360
really had a passion for this i'm like

151
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
this is something i really wanted to do

152
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,759
um and it took a long way to get to

153
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,680
where i was to do that

154
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
and so i tried to find ways of learning

155
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,800
new material seeing where i could be

156
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,280
able to

157
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
get more understanding of backtrack how

158
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,639
to actually get certified as well too

159
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,520
into it

160
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
and the first thing i saw was on a fedex

161
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
web page penetration testing with

162
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,199
backtrack and of course the oscp

163
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,479
so going through the time of it i was 16

164
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,680
at the time i couldn't be able to take

165
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,199
it you had to be 18

166
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,800
to be able to take it the course itself

167
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,240
so i thought all right there's gonna be

168
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,040
some stuff i can

169
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,560
prepare for and get some prerequisites

170
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,800
right so my journey started basically

171
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,520
like this

172
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
pwp i'm prepping for it i'm gonna get

173
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,639
ready for it well

174
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,039
things kind of changed uh the course

175
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,800
actually released pwk

176
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
and then from there i actually took the

177
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
old version of pwk

178
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,199
went through the actual labs went

179
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,639
through the course material of course

180
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,639
had to do the try harder moments right

181
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,919
you know to be able to get to that top

182
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,400
of the mountain just to earn the oacp

183
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,039
so going into the course prerequisites

184
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,600
right

185
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,840
so how do you know you're ready what

186
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,199
should you do to decide to prepare for

187
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,240
the course right so

188
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,000
there's a couple things that we ask that

189
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,440
you prepare for or have at least an

190
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
understanding of before you start the

191
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,440
course

192
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,039
uh one of the things of course is tcp

193
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
networking fundamentals right know your

194
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,479
ip addresses know your subnetting

195
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,240
how network traffic is sent receive and

196
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
also the different types of protocols

197
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,240
right

198
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,520
know your operating systems know how

199
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,919
windows works know how linux systems

200
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,560
work

201
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,000
also have some understanding of

202
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,840
programming languages now this doesn't

203
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,960
mean that you have to be fully

204
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,600
experienced

205
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
writing in python writing in powershell

206
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
writing it bash but at least have an

207
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,160
understanding of

208
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,759
how to read the code how to review the

209
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,120
code and then see what changes you need

210
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,319
to make to actually

211
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,600
make the code work for what you're

212
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
trying to assess in the lab or even in

213
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,720
the course material

214
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
and note taking is super important

215
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,120
documentation is an important

216
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,319
key that i always encourage people to do

217
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,600
whenever they're going through this

218
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
course now i've also provided some

219
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,479
note-taking tools

220
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,560
joplin is one of my favorite tools now

221
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,479
uh i really like how you could be able

222
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,000
to write everything down in markdown it

223
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
has a really nice reading preview

224
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,960
and the other thing too that's really

225
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,639
cool about it it has a synchronization

226
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,600
tool as well too

227
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
that you can actually go ahead and sync

228
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
your notes into a local

229
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
cloud storage a file share or even onto

230
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
dropbox or in the cloud as well too

231
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,080
uh before i took the ocp i also used

232
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
cherrytree and i was okay with it i

233
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,479
really

234
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,240
wasn't a huge fan of it and microsoft

235
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,919
onenote as well too

236
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,840
and also typora which also is another

237
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,520
markdown reader and writer as well too

238
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,680
that you can use

239
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
so the overview of the course what has

240
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
changed what's new in the new updates

241
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,000
right

242
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
so pretty much all the topics that you

243
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,759
see here have been updated

244
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,080
the new topics that have been added is

245
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,919
active directory attacks and powershell

246
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,639
empire

247
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,960
um the big ones that have been revamped

248
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,759
and updated

249
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,120
have been web application attacks

250
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
previous escalation the buffer overflow

251
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
section is entirely new

252
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
as well too basically explaining and

253
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,919
walking through more information on

254
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,479
how to actually you know find the

255
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,280
vulnerable

256
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,800
defined vulnerabilities in it and also

257
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
how to exploit it as well too

258
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
so what's the new lab environment like

259
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,199
so for me

260
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,639
this was probably the fun part about the

261
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,759
course is that when you've gone through

262
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,120
the material when you review all the

263
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,240
material

264
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,520
then you get to go ahead and go into the

265
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,199
lab so the lab now has 75 machines

266
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,800
almost all the machines are pretty much

267
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
up to date running from windows server

268
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,479
2012 to 2019

269
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,639
windows 10 boxes and on the linux side

270
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
you also have from w9 to w10

271
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,319
and also with red hat systems that have

272
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
been updated as well too

273
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,360
in the new lab environment when you're

274
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
going through the course material you'll

275
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,240
actually be provided with the following

276
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,440
boxes you'll be provided with the

277
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,000
windows 10

278
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,720
box a windows server 2016 box and a

279
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
debian test box as well too

280
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
and the lab is now broken into four

281
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,840
networks yes

282
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,000
back then in the old pwk you actually

283
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
had a student

284
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,599
lab which is a public network the i.t

285
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
department and the development network

286
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,400
and administration network now you also

287
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,000
have a new section called the sandbox

288
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
network where

289
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,520
you can actually go ahead in the last

290
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,960
section of pwk

291
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,240
you actually can go through a full

292
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
assessment and in that full assessment

293
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
you have the sandbox network there where

294
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,720
you can actually

295
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,039
walk through what we basically go

296
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,840
through during

297
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
assessment in this sandbox network which

298
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,919
is really cool

299
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,839
so here's a basic look of what the old

300
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,279
network looks like and what the new

301
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,000
network looks like

302
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
now of what they've been added and which

303
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,760
is really cool on what they've done as

304
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,560
well too

305
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
for you to be able to build your

306
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,600
practical skills and knowledge you know

307
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,720
when you're going through the course

308
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
itself

309
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,640
so what do i recommend for a lab setup

310
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,080
you know when you're preparing for the

311
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,040
course itself

312
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,399
definitely have vmware workstation

313
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,279
vmware player and also have kali linux

314
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,720
now you could be able to use your own

315
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
tools you can be able to use virtualbox

316
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
if you wanted for your hypervisor or any

317
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,600
other hypervisor that is out there

318
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
but the only reason why i recommend

319
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,880
using vmware workstation or vmware

320
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
player and kali linux

321
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,519
is because student admins will be able

322
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,360
to support you better with what's going

323
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,000
on

324
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
it's really cool to see also what you're

325
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,240
going to be using and what you're going

326
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,440
to be preparing as well through the

327
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,560
course itself

328
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,760
now the new pwk actually you can use a

329
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
standard kali linux 64-bit machine or

330
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,440
32-bit machine that's there

331
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
uh for people that are using the old pwk

332
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
and going through the old labs

333
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,040
you can use the old pwk image that we

334
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,360
have that's already set up there

335
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,880
and then of course also on your local

336
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
systems have a windows 10 box or windows

337
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,440
7 box

338
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,880
and i also recommend having immunity

339
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,560
debugger on both the systems

340
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,160
and the reason why i say it is because

341
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,760
in case you're testing any exploits in

342
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,040
the lab itself that you want to test

343
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,760
locally

344
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
you have those boxes there you have

345
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
those systems there that you can test

346
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,640
those app those vulnerable applications

347
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,240
to see if your exploit code or if your

348
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,680
configurations are actually true when

349
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
you're going to the lab itself

350
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,880
so assessing the pwk lab network a lot

351
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,200
of

352
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
people will probably tell you how they

353
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,399
approach the lab how they went through

354
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,200
the environment

355
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
and there's many different ways that you

356
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,399
can go through it and also some people

357
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,839
have also said they finished it really

358
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,240
at this time or at this time right

359
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
my recommendation is to you is that

360
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
everybody goes through this lab

361
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,320
differently

362
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,240
everybody goes to the course differently

363
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,000
and i say it depends on to you if you

364
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,440
want to be able to take the time

365
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,880
and also to go through the material

366
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
properly before you jump into the lab or

367
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,279
jump through different chapters of the

368
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,600
material right this isn't going to be a

369
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,560
sprint

370
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,160
this is a marathon for you to go ahead

371
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,680
and go to the material learn it and

372
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,399
understand it

373
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,959
properly when you go through so when i

374
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
did it it took me 28 days and 127 hours

375
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,399
to go through

376
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,320
the systems that were in the lab some of

377
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
the systems that i went through

378
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,640
were pretty easy one day i would pawn 17

379
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
boxes in 14 hours

380
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,480
and another day it would take me two to

381
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
three days just to pone one box

382
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,040
each system has its own difficulty set

383
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,399
up by a giant machine

384
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,680
and some of the systems you'll actually

385
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,279
have to pivot through from different lab

386
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,079
environments now

387
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,519
especially in the new environment that's

388
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,120
set up and

389
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,640
of course make sure that you use your

390
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,560
reverts properly

391
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
if you're going through a system a lot

392
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,600
of the students that have been on those

393
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
systems that have access

394
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
might leave some leftover stuff some

395
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
artifacts as well too if you want to be

396
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
able to learn and understand

397
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,519
the systems properly going through it

398
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
make sure you revert the systems

399
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,040
that will give you a fresh clean state

400
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,399
of how to approach the box and how to

401
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,839
assess it going forward instead of

402
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,200
cheating yourself and being fair to

403
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
yourself when you're doing that

404
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,920
so other tips i want to say enumerate

405
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
enumerate enumerate uh you probably have

406
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,200
heard this from so many people when

407
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,240
they've gone through the lab

408
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
enumeration is key there are so many

409
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,079
different things that can be on each

410
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,920
system each system has their own

411
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,120
different scenario of what you're going

412
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
to be looking at and understand the

413
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,240
purpose of how these systems are being

414
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,040
used right

415
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,360
why was that system there who set it up

416
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,880
what was the purpose of it being used

417
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,600
for

418
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
document everything there could be some

419
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
things if you don't document properly

420
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,240
that you could miss

421
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
right certain scans that you also do

422
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
maybe it's a udp scan maybe there's

423
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,959
something you can't find

424
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,200
but make sure you actually go ahead and

425
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
see what that system is doing

426
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
and make sure that you document it

427
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,639
properly in the end track your hours

428
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,839
see how long it takes you to go through

429
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,360
each system maybe you're spending too

430
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,000
much time on one

431
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,120
system and maybe you should jump to

432
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,959
another system just to see what it is

433
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,959
and what varies for you

434
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,480
the other thing i also say is don't skip

435
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
the lab exercises what's really cool now

436
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,959
about the new pwk is that they've added

437
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,720
a section called extra miles

438
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,920
now depending on the labs that you do

439
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
each extra mile actually adds an extra

440
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,279
challenge that you can try and you can

441
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,000
do

442
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
now you don't have to put these in the

443
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,000
lab report itself which is nice

444
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,680
but i definitely encourage you to try

445
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
out those extra miles see

446
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
how you could do and apply your

447
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
practical knowledge going through those

448
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,519
itself they are separate

449
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,639
challenges that you can do in the lab so

450
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,920
in order for you to submit your lab

451
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,519
report you need at least still have 10

452
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,279
systems documented of how you assess

453
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,760
them

454
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
and also you need to complete all the

455
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
exercises when you complete all those

456
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
exercises and also have documented all

457
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,680
10

458
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,000
10 systems that you uh assessed in the

459
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,959
lab itself

460
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
you could be able to get five points

461
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,480
added to your exam

462
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,000
and the last thing of course i recommend

463
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
when you're going to the lab is use your

464
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,440
reverbs like i said earlier

465
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
so let's talk about the exam next what's

466
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
going to happen the exam

467
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,519
so you will have a total of 23 hours and

468
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,120
45 minutes for the exam

469
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,440
you will be proctored during your exam

470
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,279
webcam and screen sharing software

471
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,880
is required it is a must when you go

472
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,399
through the exam itself

473
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,000
back in the days when i took it you

474
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
could be able to have a laptop that was

475
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
separate for your webcam and then have

476
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,720
your system that you were doing

477
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
everything with cali

478
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,760
or assessing with the system itself when

479
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,000
you're in the exam be used separately

480
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,519
now that's not the case you cannot do

481
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,880
that anymore you need to at least have

482
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
your webcam

483
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,079
and the screen sharing software tied to

484
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,360
your one system that you're doing

485
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
everything on for the exam

486
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,959
the exam will consist of five targets

487
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,639
that you get and these targets range

488
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,360
from

489
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,120
different operating systems or it could

490
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,480
be the different level of difficulty

491
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,839
but really it's gonna depend on you

492
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760
going through that you need at least a

493
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,160
seven

494
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
minimum 70 points or higher to pass yes

495
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,519
you do

496
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,079
um and this is where i recommended you

497
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,600
getting that extra five points come in

498
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,000
because

499
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
that could be the deciding factor of you

500
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
passing or you failing

501
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
and if you believe you have enough

502
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
points then you have another 24 hours to

503
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
write the report

504
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,519
and the one thing i do recommend is that

505
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,600
no matter how many points you get

506
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,000
i'd still say try to write that report

507
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,199
and the reason why is that that'll

508
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,639
improve your writing skills

509
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,480
also prepare you for writing the report

510
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
as well too ahead of time

511
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,680
and what's also really good for you as

512
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,120
well too

513
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,199
is that even if you fail you have an

514
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,320
understanding of what you wrote in the

515
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,959
report

516
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,959
what you did you may not get the same

517
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,560
systems in your next exam or the next

518
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,079
one moving forward of whatever attempt

519
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:34,880
you have

520
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,160
but at least gives you understanding of

521
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
how your writing is and how your report

522
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,480
can be

523
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,639
i've seen many people pass you know when

524
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,160
they've got all five systems right off

525
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,040
the bat

526
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
and they actually failed the exam

527
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
because of their reporting you know it

528
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,079
could be other gravitational errors not

529
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,680
enough details

530
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,440
formatting could be an issue as well too

531
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
or not even proper screenshots as well

532
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,639
at least from what i've seen and heard

533
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,760
from the students that have taken the

534
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
course

535
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,880
exam restrictions this is another big

536
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,279
one that i've seen

537
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,639
you cannot use any of the following

538
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,199
systems or following tools in the exam

539
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,760
spoofing commercial tools automated

540
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,880
exploitation tools

541
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,440
mass vulnerability scanners any features

542
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,360
that are included in some of the tools

543
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,959
that do some of the following things

544
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,560
like auto pwn or mass vulnerability

545
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,199
scanning

546
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,079
spoofing those are also restricted from

547
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
being used in the exam

548
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,120
and the reason why they do that is

549
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,480
because they want you to be able to go

550
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
through everything manually at least try

551
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:26,959
to

552
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,120
you know and maybe even script your own

553
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,839
stuff for what you need

554
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,759
so preparing for the exam these are my

555
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,519
tips on what i want to give to you guys

556
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,560
right

557
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
so when you feel comfortable taking the

558
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,079
exam right schedule it three to four

559
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,440
weeks in advance because this will give

560
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,560
you plenty of time of what you need to

561
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,759
prepare for

562
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,360
and once you've gone through the exam

563
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,480
guidelines once you've gone through the

564
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,839
course material once you think you've

565
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,279
gone through enough systems in your lab

566
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,600
or

567
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,920
your pwk time has run out do a couple

568
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,639
things

569
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,920
complete the lab reported class

570
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320
exercises to get that extra five points

571
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
read the guideline requirements as well

572
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,480
too before you take the exam

573
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,040
find a area or at least have an area or

574
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,519
space

575
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,880
that you will not be distracted when

576
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,959
you're taking your exam do not forget to

577
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:07,600
eat or drink

578
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,360
prepare some snacks prepare some water

579
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
coffee tea right whatever you

580
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,880
there's any type of substance you know

581
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,639
you need for this exam

582
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
prepare your feed sheets notes tools

583
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
exploits make sure you have your systems

584
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,040
up and ready to go

585
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,959
snapshots are very important and i'm

586
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,240
going to give you one of my scenarios

587
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,079
that happened to me

588
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,880
when i took my pwk exam last the day

589
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
before i took it i actually snapchatted

590
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,680
my system

591
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,279
had everything my notes and tools ready

592
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,040
to go and on the morning i was about to

593
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,160
take my exam

594
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,600
i'd turn on my cali box everything

595
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,279
crashed i lost everything

596
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
files were corrupted luckily i was able

597
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,120
to revert back that snapshot

598
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,560
and able to get all my stuff back in

599
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
that clean slate so

600
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,639
snapshots backups are important to have

601
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,399
before you go through that exam

602
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,759
and also start working on your exam

603
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,360
report have that draft ready like i said

604
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,079
earlier

605
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,880
get some rest as well too don't be

606
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
overproductive or overthink things the

607
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,399
day before your exam

608
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,240
you need break and you need to have a

609
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,839
break mentally as well too

610
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,759
so spend some time with family friends

611
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,959
loved ones if you can

612
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,400
or at least take a step away from the

613
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,520
computer as if you can as well

614
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
this is one of the big quotes that

615
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,880
really helped me

616
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,559
as well too getting ready for the exam

617
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,439
from a buddy of mine from xerox df

618
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,880
you're going to run out of ideas before

619
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
you run out of time take breaks

620
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,480
walk away for a bit don't be afraid to

621
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,839
go to sleep for a few hours especially

622
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,799
if you're stuck

623
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,839
because that's what's gonna happen for

624
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,559
you in the exam remember try not to iron

625
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,360
man the exam

626
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,720
try not to sprint through the exam

627
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,799
itself take time to understand the

628
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,360
systems

629
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,039
review your methodology review your

630
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,640
concepts that you built onto it

631
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,559
to help yourself with this exam and

632
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,880
don't feel nervous taking it as well too

633
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,240
everybody goes through this more than

634
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
once or even some people who have gone

635
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,200
through it properly

636
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,880
will be able to pass on the first try

637
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
but that's okay

638
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
failure leads to your success no matter

639
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,080
what you try to do and what you brush up

640
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,600
into

641
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
so i prepared for some resources to help

642
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,640
you with your ocp if

643
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
some of you have seen this already some

644
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
of you are probably still

645
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,039
getting into it starting to prepare for

646
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,880
oc but i wrote a huge guide

647
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,679
uh for last year about the ocp and how

648
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,039
to prepare for it with a variety of

649
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,320
different materials for each chapter

650
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,360
going through it

651
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,280
um i do plan to update this with the new

652
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,200
material soon but i want to give some

653
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,559
time for students that are taking the

654
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,440
course itself

655
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,880
to go through it and give their thoughts

656
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,240
and feedback of how the course is for

657
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,559
them

658
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,880
how they're liking the material and also

659
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,480
what stuff they like going on the lab

660
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,000
itself i've also prepared a huge list

661
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,440
and many of you have probably seen this

662
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
list of ocp-like vms

663
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,400
the link that i have right there has a

664
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
list of vulnerable machines that you can

665
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
go ahead and practice on

666
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,559
uh through different resources that you

667
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,559
can find online and also from offline

668
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,679
like bom hub for

669
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,480
instance other resources that i have

670
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,919
that really helped me prepare for it as

671
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,600
well too personally before i went

672
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,559
through this

673
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,919
um was apache's ocp guide scrunders

674
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
passing osep

675
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,960
they were really great guys to help me

676
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
out some books as well too like cal

677
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
linux revealed attacking network

678
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,880
protocols

679
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,240
those books really helped me out trying

680
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
to get started preparing for the ocp

681
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
as well and then i have some other

682
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,840
resources that really help me out

683
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,600
so the reason why i'm putting these

684
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
resources here is because one of my

685
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
biggest issues that i had going through

686
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,080
the lab itself

687
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,679
and also going through the course

688
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,760
material was privileged escalation

689
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
uh you probably have noticed that on

690
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,919
linux escalation got milk has these huge

691
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,000
guise on how to prevent linux systems

692
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
that was one of the big guides that

693
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,799
really helped me out and also in the

694
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,320
windows side i have a couple links in

695
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,720
there

696
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,640
that also gave me some good inspiration

697
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,840
of how to progress systems on the

698
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
windows side and the linux side just to

699
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,880
help beef up my skills that really

700
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,840
helped out

701
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,520
and on the buffer overslow section just

702
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,799
to get a better understanding of the

703
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,480
introductions cornland series really

704
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,280
helped me out

705
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,559
just getting understanding of how buffer

706
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,160
overflows worked how the process is to

707
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,960
go through it

708
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,039
find that exploited space and try to go

709
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,640
ahead and actually get a shell from the

710
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
box from there

711
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,799
so one of the big things that i want to

712
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,480
end this presentation on just

713
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,039
before we go ahead and leave is the try

714
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,960
harder mindset right

715
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,880
i know many of you probably have

716
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,400
negative views of tryharder

717
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,559
don't like the idea of it and i get that

718
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,240
and i understand that

719
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,760
some of you have also mentioned the idea

720
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,159
of try smarter personally to myself

721
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,600
i think the try harder motto is an

722
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
amazing motto and which really helped me

723
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,400
out going through the oscp and the

724
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,480
reason why i say that is because

725
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,840
the mindset of try harder means the

726
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,200
following things it means to be

727
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,919
persistence

728
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,679
it means to be creative and also to have

729
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,280
a different perspective

730
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,960
and so when you are trying to be

731
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,400
persistent in the lab

732
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
you know when something doesn't work the

733
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
first or second time and you hit a brick

734
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,080
wall

735
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
remember to take a step back remember

736
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,600
mistakes and failures are part of the

737
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,159
process

738
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,440
kind of like i said when you go through

739
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,720
the lab when you go through the course

740
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,080
material and even in your exam you're

741
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,360
going to have those mistakes

742
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,919
you're going to struggle that's okay

743
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,360
take the time to learn and understand

744
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
what you made a mistake on to build your

745
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
skills and go through this right

746
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,120
so having this mindset is going to give

747
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,520
you a the ability to create new ideas

748
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,039
and also to have new approaches

749
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,559
and also remember to have patience when

750
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,159
you go through this keep pushing

751
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,080
don't give up right thomas edison's

752
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,520
quote our greatest weakness lies in

753
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,320
giving up

754
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,760
the most certain way to succeed is

755
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,520
always just to try one more time

756
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,799
how many times did he try to go ahead

757
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,240
and make the light bulb right he went

758
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
through so many attempts he went through

759
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,039
so many processes just to get

760
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,360
one project of his working to make that

761
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,520
invention that we use now today

762
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,159
the next thing be creative right

763
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,400
remember to try new and different things

764
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,840
get out of your comfort zone of trying

765
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,760
some tools that you've used right

766
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
near new tools out there there are new

767
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,799
scripts out there there are new exploits

768
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,280
out there

769
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,039
go ahead give them a shot if they don't

770
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,880
work that's okay you know it doesn't

771
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
work for this system or for this

772
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,880
vulnerable app

773
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,480
try some other ones that are out there i

774
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,679
bet you there's a bunch of people that

775
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,360
have written different code for it

776
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,919
and also being perceptive situational

777
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,520
awareness is a critical skill that all

778
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
of us need to have in this field

779
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,720
and i think it's really important not

780
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,159
even from a red team or from a pen

781
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,360
testing perspective but even from a

782
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,640
bluetooth perspective

783
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
we need to be able to understand

784
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,080
situations when we need to find ways to

785
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
react to them in those times of need

786
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,440
learn to be efficient and learn to be

787
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,760
effective don't try to iron man the

788
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,200
courses or the exams you take in the

789
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,919
general world

790
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,520
make time to step back and actively

791
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,039
assess the situation to make the good

792
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,559
decisions that you need to do

793
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,240
and keep in mind though that the skill

794
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,600
does not come naturally

795
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,120
but it's important for us to learn it

796
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
and understand it so we can build it

797
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,360
moving forward

798
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,880
especially in the field that we work in

799
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,480
today

800
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,760
so with that being said this is all i

801
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,600
have for preparing for the oscp

802
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,799
and going through the new stuff in the

803
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,720
material as well too

804
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
if anybody has any questions now is the

805
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
time um and if anybody needs to ask me

806
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,200

824
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,640
looks

825
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760

i have a few more things i want to add

828
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,000
to it but i at least give you an idea

829
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
there's 40 pages of notes

830
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,919
that i took from pwk and also from

831
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,679
current assessments that i've been on

832
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,080
um i'm currently getting it reviewed by

833
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,720
offset

834
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,159
just to make sure that they are okay

835
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,440
with it and then they could be able to

836
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,240
support it

837
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,640
so right now at this time uh just keep a

838
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,919
watch on my twitter

839
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,440
and any updates that come through it and

840
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,799
hopefully i'll have it out soon for you

841
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,039
guys

842
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,320
the other thing like a lot of people

843
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,360
have been asking is i think you're gonna

844
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,880
be posting your slides afterwards

845
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,000
because obviously you've got a [ __ ] to

846
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
the legs

847
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,640
yep yep i will be doing that for sure as

848
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
well too um and i'll have that posted

849
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,080
soon as well

850
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,559
uh another question here um do you have

851
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,159
a preferred screenshot tool

852
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,880
in the new 2020 cali image or yes

853
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,440
kazam is my favorite i i really like how

854
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,360
the cali team actually put that tool in

855
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,200
there as well too for the new xfce

856
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,039
desktop environment that they have

857
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,480
um it used gnome had a really okay one

858
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,640
but the thing i like about kazam is that

859
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,240
it also does screen recording as well

860
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,120
too

861
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
which is also one thing not to mention

862
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,080
that you also really helped me bring up

863
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,360
with that question

864
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,120
you can't be able to record your screen

865
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
as well too during the exam

866
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,880
that is another thing that offset as

867
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
well too has now taken out of doing your

868
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,960
exam

869
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,559
that makes sense uh do the currents

870
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,880
do the current coverage situation due to

871
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,240
the current looks like

872
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
choose the current government situation

873
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
are exams heavily proctored and

874
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,279
monitored more than usual

875
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,520
as well as how often are the labs

876
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,720
updated for the exam

877
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,520
in case one in case you feel your

878
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,640
attempt

879
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,039
so i can't really uh i can't really ask

880
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,240
her about the proctoring

881
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
um but i can say at least the proctoring

882
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,520
standards have stayed the same nothing

883
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,400
has changed

884
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
uh from what i know at least from my

885
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,679
perspective

886
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,320
but going to the course material and how

887
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,120
that's being

888
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,159
made the pwk lab environment and the

889
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,080
course material is supposed to reflect

890
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,640
on

891
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
what current topics and attacks that we

892
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,919
see going on in the real world now

893
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,520
so a lot of the materials still will

894
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,880
apply to what you're going to be doing

895
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,080
in the exam

896
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,240
nothing has really big or changed it's

897
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
in the exam itself

898
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,000
it's more of you taking the time to go

899
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,120
ahead and going through those systems

900
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,159
that you will see

901
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,080
so i still encourage you to go ahead and

902
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,520
take the course i still encourage you to

903
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,360
go to the new lab environment

904
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,039
it's just both lab environments will

905
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,400
still help you prepare for the exam at

906
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,080
this time

907
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,000
sweet um another question here

908
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,960
on your core christie um how many hours

909
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,320
should a newbie expect

910
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,120
to spend before becoming ready for oscp

911
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
that's a really good question

912
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,120
um time wise that is really up to you

913
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
and the reason why i say that is because

914
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,480
you will really only know

915
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,159
how much time you need to go through to

916
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,159
prepare for the course and also what

917
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,520
material and what

918
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,360
topics you need to brush up on or even

919
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,880
start learning more about

920
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,279
um so that's why i recommend tracking

921
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,799
your hours you know having an excel

922
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,159
spreadsheet you know how much time did

923
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,679
you spend on a specific topic whether

924
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,120
it's learning more about python

925
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
learning about powershell or learning

926
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
about specific client side attacks right

927
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,760
you know how to

928
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
craft your hda file or macro attack

929
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,200
right those are things that you're going

930
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,080
to be

931
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,120
you know you need to prepare for

932
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,360
yourself learning wise but also you will

933
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
be able to do it through the material as

934
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,279
well too i think

935
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,840
sweet um i've got another question here

936
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,520
uh is there a road map that

937
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,559
one could follow um to ensure they have

938
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,400
all the skills needed to pass their exam

939
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
they're on the third attempt

940
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
at the moment and they've all managed to

941
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,279
get to the 10-point box

942
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,720
i can't really answer any questions

943
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,559
about the exam unfortunately uh

944
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,799
my only guidance for you or for the

945
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,559
person that asked that question

946
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,279
is figure out what you need to brush up

947
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:47,840
on and

948
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,679
figure out what you missed you know or

949
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,120
what you need to improve on from the

950
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,000
exam

951
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,960
and that's what the exam is for the exam

952
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,760
is there to

953
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
test your skills to test your knowledge

954
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,960
physically and mentally

955
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,440
when you go through it um and also to go

956
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,039
through on what stuff you may have

957
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,480
passed through what you exceeded on or

958
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,320
what you still need to improve you know

959
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,679
one of my big things right

960
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,679
is i didn't use metasploit enough in the

961
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,120
in the lab network

962
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,799
and i didn't really get to use it much

963
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,120
in the exam but coming out now after

964
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,880
i've obtained my ocp

965
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
metasploit really is still something

966
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,559
that people still use you know preparing

967
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,919
for their stuff using the exploit multi

968
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:22,559
handler

969
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,559
using the socks proxy that's on there

970
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,840
and that stuff i kind of had to learn

971
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,440
more outside and i kind of wish i

972
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,120
applied that more into the pwk lab

973
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,320
nice someone asked a question earlier on

974
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,799
i i

975
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,559
skipped past it but they were asking for

976
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,720
um offset have any certifications

977
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,399
um other than osw osce

978
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,840
and between oscp and osce

979
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,840
not not at this time

980
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
cool any more questions folks questions

981
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,480
as of offset has updated the pwk course

982
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,320
uh is mentioned on the website that the

983
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,360
exam is not

984
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,000
changed so how can one know assess that

985
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,720
they've learned

986
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,480
from the new updated material versus the

987
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,559
old material

988
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,279
that is a really good question um

989
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,640
i'd say this right the best way to look

990
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,720
at the updates of how

991
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,480
how stuff has been changed is look at is

992
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,840
review the course syllabus that we have

993
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,760
on our offsets page right now

994
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,640
that will give you a better

995
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
understanding of what the new course

996
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,440
material is like and what you can see on

997
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,159
there that's been added

998
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,000
sweet uh have we got any more questions

999
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,360
on that i think we've rattled through

1000
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
all the questions in stream

1001
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,320
one in discord um what is considered

1002
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,520
manual tools

1003
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,840
um

1004
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,080
yeah what yeah that's right which

1005
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,480
um i guess it's it's down to what's

1006
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,159
allowed to be used in the exam

1007
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,679
when it so between automated and manual

1008
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,279
okay that that makes more sense now

1009
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,559
because that's what i was thinking was

1010
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,919
the difference between automated and

1011
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,679
manual right

1012
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,200
the reason why i say you should do

1013
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,240
manual tools right is because each tool

1014
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
has its own different functions and own

1015
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,159
different ways that it works

1016
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,679
and it's a great way for you to

1017
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,840
understand how the tools work how the

1018
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,360
command let's work in a tool right

1019
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,880
and that pat for instance let's let's

1020
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
pick a tool right we'll pick map map has

1021
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,399
a variety different command switches in

1022
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,039
that tool

1023
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,880
of how to be able to scan not just you

1024
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,720
know one ip address not with one target

1025
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,679
multiple targets

1026
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,279
and also doing different types of scans

1027
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,039
right there's a lot of tools that are

1028
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,880
out there like sparta for instance you

1029
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,399
know it's an automated tool

1030
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,760
that goes ahead and actually does the

1031
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,000
scans for you you know in those scans

1032
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,120
right you might not be able to get the

1033
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,320
results that you're looking for

1034
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
or you also may be missing results so

1035
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,000
that's why i encourage you

1036
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
or encourage other students as well too

1037
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,520
that are going to be pairing or taking

1038
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,080
the course

1039
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,559
is to use these tools manually start

1040
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,760
getting an understanding and build your

1041
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,360
knowledge of how the tools work

1042
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,679
and also be able to learn more about

1043
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,120
what to do with specific parts of the

1044
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,640
tool that you're going to be using

1045
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,320
i'm not really a huge fan of automated

1046
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,159
tools because automated tools really do

1047
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,760
skip a lot of things unless you actually

1048
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
know what the tool is actually scanning

1049
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,799
or what the tool is actually doing what

1050
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,399
the purpose is for it if that makes

1051
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,399
sense

1052
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,240
sweet so we've got another question here

1053
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,200
from mr angus angus red

1054
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,880
do you try harder in your day-to-day

1055
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
life tj

1056
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,960
no i don't try harder every day no i'm

1057
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,919
just kidding i

1058
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,919
i take that mindset and i take that

1059
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,840
motto with me wherever i go and i feel

1060
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,279
like it's been a really a big part of

1061
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,480
motto not just

1062
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,559
even like with me taking the course and

1063
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,240
taking the exam but it's been part of my

1064
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,279
life for a long time

1065
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,679
really going through before the course

1066
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,279
starting the course and after the course

1067
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,799
and still continuing now

1068
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,480
you know trying different ways you know

1069
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
being creative having a different

1070
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
perspective on things and also being

1071
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,640
persistence on what i try to do

1072
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,440
sweet uh going on here uh what is the

1073
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,200
best way to my self learning

1074
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,279
school and life in general i find myself

1075
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,799
spending too much time

1076
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,159
in security i'm not enough time in

1077
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,520
school and vice versa i should have

1078
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,880
tried to schedule

1079
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,080
my my exam weeks out in advance i would

1080
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,480
say

1081
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,559
schedule your exam at least like i said

1082
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,919
three to four weeks in advance

1083
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,679
you know try to be able to find a

1084
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,039
balance of your skills

1085
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,440
you know taking time going through a box

1086
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,880
and also taking time to do the course

1087
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,440
material

1088
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,960
but also when you're preparing for the

1089
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,039
exam itself using that lab network the

1090
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,640
pwk lab network itself

1091
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,240
use it as a way to test yourself going

1092
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,919
through the lab get getting ready to

1093
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,200
prepare for the exam

1094
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,720
you know go through boxes on different

1095
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,200
ways right you know in the lab network

1096
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,880
itself there's probably more than one

1097
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,760
way to get into

1098
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,120
you know into those targets or those

1099
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,279
systems right whether it's through

1100
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,720
password reuse whether it's through

1101
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,159
security misconfiguration

1102
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,679
there's always an alternative to find a

1103
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,720
way to get into those targets

1104
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,760
sweet uh another questions in here are

1105
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,399
there any

1106
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,080
specific programming languages that

1107
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,760
you'd suggest that one should know

1108
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,240
before entering into pwk

1109
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,840
i'd say it really it depends

1110
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,919
uh i personally recommend python because

1111
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:52,880
a lot of exploits

1112
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
are used in python right and get an

1113
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
understanding of how

1114
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,919
you know how some people write their

1115
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,200
exploits what changes you need to make

1116
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,279
to it um i also say powershell is

1117
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,960
another big thing to add to it the

1118
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,200
new pwk has a whole new section on

1119
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,480
powershell scripting which is really

1120
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,039
cool

1121
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,720
and also using some powershell tools as

1122
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,320
well but getting at least a good

1123
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,679
understanding of how powershell works

1124
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,960
how to write your own command list i

1125
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,320
think those are big helps

1126
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,159
as well you know helping yourself get a

1127
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,200
better understanding of the course

1128
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,919
material moving forward

1129
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,000
i've got a question from jack and chat

1130
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,960
um off topic but yeah sort of relevant

1131
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,399
do you have a mentor or someone who

1132
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,320
inspired you or motivated you to begin

1133
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,640
your

1134
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,600
infosec journey my mentor was actually

1135
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,960
my high school teacher

1136
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,440
without him uh giving me that backtrack

1137
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,279
cd in the backtrack cookbook i would

1138
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,760
have never got started to where i am now

1139
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,320
and he was actually a cisco teacher and

1140
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,840
he would just teach me more about cisco

1141
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,200
fundamentals

1142
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,120
so he really went out of his way to do

1143
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,360
that kind of stuff

1144
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,320
sweet um jesus there's so many questions

1145
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,519
they're all flying in now

1146
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,279
um how would you compare oscp to gxpn i

1147
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,000
assume they mean

1148
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,080
sans gxpn and if you've sat either of

1149
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,120
the two i have sat in gxpn and i will

1150
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,679
say that

1151
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,760
gxpn is a little bit more advanced than

1152
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,159
the pwk because the pwk is to focus on

1153
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,799
the pen testing fundamentals uh gxpn

1154
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,919
definitely focuses on

1155
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,240
exploit development uh and moving on to

1156
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,080
some more advanced tools there

1157
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,200
so sweet so

1158
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,559
go on on discord are you allowed to

1159
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,559
write and bring your own tools into

1160
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,399
the exam you can be able to yes but i

1161
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,279
would if you

1162
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,799
want to make sure that it doesn't meet

1163
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,320
any of the exam restrictions

1164
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,000
you can definitely ask a student admin

1165
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,679
or an essay from support they'll be able

1166
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,960
to give you a better understanding if

1167
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,240
that tool is approved or not

1168
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,679
[Music]

1169
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,880
anymore i think that's

1170
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,799
most of the questions we've still got 20

1171
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,000
minutes left you rattled through

1172
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,799
everything in like

1173
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,519
30 23 minutes flat so yeah i figured i'd

1174
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,720
get more questions or at least try to

1175
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,159
have some discussion if anybody wants to

1176
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,240
bring anything up or have any advice

1177
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,679
uh at least to get go ahead and get

1178
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,159
started with i've got a question i

1179
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,039
suppose

1180
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,679
after after oscp what what was your kind

1181
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,640
of next steps

1182
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,480
into like well actually i supposed to

1183
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,000
rephrase that question

1184
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,399
how far into or before your career did

1185
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,760
you take your scp and what were your

1186
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,079
next steps after oscp

1187
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,199
so i will tell you before i got my oscp

1188
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,679
my goal was to get it um but i actually

1189
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,440
went down the blue team path i was a

1190
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,639
stock analyst

1191
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,719
for two years working in my career once

1192
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,918
i graduated college

1193
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,918
and going through that when i started

1194
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,520
preparing more for osp

1195
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,359
a lot of the material i learned for osp

1196
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,040
also helped me with my daily job trying

1197
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,879
to detect things trying to look at

1198
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,040
specific attacks or events as well too

1199
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,239
to help me figure out

1200
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,000
you know how does it you know a hacker

1201
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,440
actually do this in this type of mindset

1202
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,359
or how to run through these things right

1203
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,839
so that really helped me out you know

1204
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:48,960
moving to my career

1205
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,119
becoming an actual full pentester now uh

1206
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,560
so now i'm starting to move more into

1207
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,760
exploit development

1208
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,199
and my goal and my plan is to actually

1209
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,599
pursue the osce by the end of this year

1210
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,119
and also to try to get into the wireless

1211
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,400
section as well too so i might actually

1212
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,440
even do oswp

1213
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,880
as well too and hopefully have a guide

1214
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,119
for those as well too in the future

1215
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,119
do you know if they're updating oswp

1216
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,560
because i sat a couple years ago and it

1217
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,119
was still

1218
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,000
pretty updated i cannot comment on that

1219
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,119
unfortunately

1220
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,599
but if any plans or announcements come

1221
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,119
soon you will see that on the official

1222
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,520
communication channels

1223
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,960
sweet uh question here do you need to

1224
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,720
do you need the new material to pass the

1225
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,880
exam now if you've said it previously if

1226
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,520
you've had the course previously

1227
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,839
i would say no if you've already taken

1228
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,200
the old material and you've already have

1229
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,520
sat down for the exam

1230
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,960
because the exam like i said is still

1231
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,800
the same the only big difference is

1232
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
between the new upgrade of the pwk

1233
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,560
which i highly recommend or encourage

1234
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,720
you that you do is there's a lot of new

1235
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
material and also a lot of different new

1236
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,000
techniques and concepts

1237
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,280
that you should go through and try to

1238
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,960
look into that maybe could even help you

1239
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,160
out to your next exam attempt

1240
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,400
sweet uh have you got have you got any

1241
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,160
tips for the exams specifically anything

1242
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,599
for people who are concerned about time

1243
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,359
or pace i think that you sort of covered

1244
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,280
that thought of it not sprinting

1245
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,640
i could go a little bit more in depth on

1246
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,880
that so um when i went through my exam

1247
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,000
attempt i had a rule

1248
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,079
of trying five things i don't know if

1249
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,280
anybody could really see my hand don't

1250
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
show in five

1251
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,599
but um i would try five different things

1252
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:19,920
right

1253
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,680
five different scans you know depending

1254
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
on the information i get or from the

1255
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,320
systems i would see right

1256
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,160
if those five things didn't work in that

1257
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,760
time of what i was doing i would move on

1258
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,119
to the next system right

1259
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,880
and go from that next system to the next

1260
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,240
system until i

1261
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,280
feel like i had enough information or

1262
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,119
i actually pawned the entire system i

1263
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,640
got the full access i needed

1264
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,320
and i had my proper screenshots i needed

1265
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,280
to put into the report

1266
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,359
sweet um

1267
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,880
i've not spotted any more questions

1268
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,920
chris have you spotted any more

1269
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,280
questions i just want

1270
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,440
um are there any tutoring services out

1271
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,640
there

1272
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,000
i'm not the best at teaching myself so

1273
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,079
uh javanov on twitch is asking if

1274
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,920
there's any tutoring services

1275
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,680
directly for oscp not at this time

1276
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,760
what i'd say is if you need any advice

1277
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,119
or guidance you can always talk to the

1278
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,200
support admins

1279
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
they are usually very kind and also

1280
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,720
general they're able to help you out or

1281
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,079
support you although they won't give you

1282
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,920
the exact answer you may be looking for

1283
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,280
but they'll at least give you some tips

1284
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,119
and ideas of what to look for next you

1285
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,040
know this the purpose of the course

1286
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,640
itself is to be self-paced you know to

1287
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,160
be on to your learning

1288
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,400
um but there's always places as well too

1289
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,839
to get guidance i'm trying to support

1290
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,040
you trying to go through those systems

1291
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,839
that you may have trouble with

1292
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,079
uh i think that's all the questions

1293
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,280
here can we extend the lab after

1294
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,640
expiration by paying extra yes you can

1295
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
so if you ever want to extend your lab

1296
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,400
extension as well too

1297
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,079
you should have received an email in

1298
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,200
your original email when you got your

1299
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,839
course

1300
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,359
that should give you a purchase link and

1301
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,880
in that purchase link you can actually

1302
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,640
go ahead and extend your lab extension

1303
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,599
from what you there

1304
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,599
but that depends on the material that

1305
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,720
you've gone through

1306
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,959
um

1307
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,760
awesome thanks i think that

1308
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,079
that wraps it up potentially oh wait

1309
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:14,880
there's no question

1310
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,040
[ __ ] they're just gonna keep coming

1311
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,240
every single time you say i think we're

1312
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,359
about to wrap it up it's like

1313
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,119
there's one more i mean we're still

1314
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,800
within time we still got 20 odd minutes

1315
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
how how much is how i need to actually

1316
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
phrase this it makes sense

1317
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,839
how different is the new pwk

1318
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,839
and the e-learning penetration testing

1319
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,680
professional in terms of updated study

1320
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,320
material

1321
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,599
i think i'd say between

1322
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,000
that material when i took it to the new

1323
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,560
pwk material now active directory

1324
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,160
attacks is really big

1325
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
there's a whole section just getting

1326
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,920
started of how to access an active

1327
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,359
directory environment how to be able to

1328
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,560
access a domain controller

1329
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,240
what a taxi could be able to do as well

1330
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,760
too they're specifically on there

1331
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,520
and also to focus more on depth as well

1332
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,880
on powershell empire

1333
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
as well too going ahead and actually

1334
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,760
setting up your own post-exploitation

1335
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,800
framework as well too with that tool

1336
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,000
cool uh right four other questions i've

1337
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,839
landed since that question was asked

1338
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,760
i'm going to turn on morning chats i can

1339
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,960
actually see it

1340
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,000
um two seconds um

1341
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,760
slow there we go uh right so

1342
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,839
question uh what is the toughest machine

1343
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,200
and how did you approach it without

1344
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,839
revealing anything about the specific

1345
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,240
box

1346
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,960
hmm toughest machine that i did in the

1347
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,480
pwk environment

1348
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,000
i have to say was humble humble was the

1349
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,760
it's one of the big four boxes and it's

1350
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,960
still and it's in the new pwk as well

1351
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,440
that was a tough one for me um but

1352
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,040
getting to understand the person who

1353
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,320
actually

1354
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,359
um found the vulnerability for that box

1355
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,599
was really cool nice

1356
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,720
um that's i was wondering

1357
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
how how well-versed in networking do you

1358
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,480
have to be before you take the course

1359
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,680
could a noob take it without any

1360
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,160
networking experience

1361
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,720
i'd say at least have some understanding

1362
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,480
and when i mean understanding

1363
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,119
i say understand how you know ip

1364
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,720
addresses work how subnetting works how

1365
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,440
the flow

1366
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,040
of network communication works right you

1367
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,480
know how you how

1368
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,839
like networking is sent right how

1369
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,119
packets are being sent forward with your

1370
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,160
sin synack

1371
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,079
you know in your act packets right also

1372
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,280
understand the different protocols that

1373
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,880
are out there right we have a total of

1374
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,400
6 65 533 different protocols running on

1375
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,119
tcp

1376
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,960
and on udp with different ports of what

1377
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,000
different purposes they're supposed to

1378
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,800
be doing

1379
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,400
so if you try to go in with the pwk with

1380
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,160
no networking experience at all

1381
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,839
it could be a little bit tough for you

1382
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,760
in the challenge although the courses

1383
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
can walk you through some of it

1384
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,800
it's good to at least have some type of

1385
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,400
understanding you know so get you

1386
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,079
ahead of the course more properly and

1387
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,359
also gives you a better understanding of

1388
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,400
what they're going to be discussing in

1389
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,599
the material itself

1390
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,839
uh right okay more questions wrong

1391
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,800
people keep asking

1392
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,520
more questions

1393
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,400
are you can you go chrissy i've got one

1394
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,359
here from jack

1395
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,920
yeah um any thoughts on implementing

1396
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,119
gns3

1397
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,920
even g and creating your own networks

1398
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,319
and

1399
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,560
practice phones exploits for oscp

1400
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,839
that is up to you entirely as a person

1401
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:18,800
um

1402
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
you know having that type of setup is

1403
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,319
great you know having a home lab is

1404
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,000
definitely great to have that all set up

1405
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,480
um

1406
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,400
i mean i even have my own for what i was

1407
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,240
doing um

1408
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,560
so i think that will give you a better

1409
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,760
understanding experience

1410
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,040
you know how to prepare yourself pretty

1411
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,800
recklessly you know once you are ready

1412
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,680
to get a better understanding of the

1413
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,040
networking fundamentals the operating

1414
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,839
system's right

1415
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,119
doing a little bit of programming will

1416
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,800
get you ready and ahead to start the

1417
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,240
course but that really all depends on

1418
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,359
how much time

1419
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,800
and effort you're going to put into that

1420
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,960
as well too preparing for it

1421
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,280
well thanks just following that um what

1422
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,880
ctfs do you recommend

1423
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,319
to help prepare for the oscp

1424
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,640
so there's a lot of good ctfs that are

1425
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,880
out there picoctf was a great starting

1426
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,319
one for me

1427
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,160
during my high school years especially

1428
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,680
um

1429
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,040
and there's a lot of good free based

1430
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,560
ones that are out there uh if you ever

1431
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,480
want to find any good ctfs on there uh

1432
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,400
that are around ctf time i believe has a

1433
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,520
really good

1434
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,000
set of upcoming cts that come out um

1435
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,839
that usually people go through

1436
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,800
um question here what search would you

1437
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,599
recommend doing

1438
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,079
after oscp um that really depends on to

1439
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,280
that person or that or

1440
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,720
what you really want to do what kind of

1441
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,560
passion you have you know

1442
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,680
some people for instance that i've

1443
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,040
talked to over the years you know they

1444
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,800
say oh i really like to get into web

1445
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,560
exploit you know web development right

1446
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,839
or you know finding web

1447
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,839
uh web attacks or finding web exploits

1448
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,760
right um and they go down you know the

1449
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,280
web route or some people like to go into

1450
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,079
the exploit development

1451
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,079
around that really depends on what you

1452
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,200
want to do

1453
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,960
or even further advance your skills you

1454
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,560
know in kind of you know in network

1455
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,319
penetration testing mobile pen testing

1456
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:52,800
that's

1457
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,160
really depends on you and what you

1458
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,760
really want to do you know for me

1459
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,200
personally i think my big thing now is

1460
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,640
getting into exploit development

1461
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,760
and that's something i want to start

1462
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,400
doing next um i did take the awa e

1463
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,359
course i was really

1464
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,280
i really enjoyed it especially going

1465
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,560
through and analyzing the source code

1466
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,079
that we're given for each challenge

1467
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,079
and also made you really think outside

1468
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,240
the box of what you were looking at

1469
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,440
but i'm probably going to come back to

1470
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,040
that soon because i feel like i have a

1471
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,240
much bigger passion than exploit

1472
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,520
development now since that's what i've

1473
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
been doing more in my current role

1474
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,599
for fun really nice um

1475
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,160
one here does the five machines for the

1476
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,160
exam and could the buffer up buffer

1477
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,960
overflow or is the buffer flow machine

1478
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,160
separate and you have to hack five i

1479
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,000
cannot answer that

1480
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,880
um like i s the only thing i can't

1481
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,400
answer at least is you will have five

1482
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,119
targets

1483
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,319
that you will have to assess cool uh

1484
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,359
follow-up from that is

1485
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,319
uh the course materials mentions cali a

1486
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,079
lot is there a reason why you need to

1487
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:50,880
use cali

1488
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,440
or is it you can use anything you want

1489
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,040
like i mentioned earlier you could use

1490
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,839
whatever

1491
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,240
district you want to use uh cali is the

1492
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,520
big one that we use

1493
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,200
in the course because that's what we

1494
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,440
teach about too there's a whole chapter

1495
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,560
based on cali

1496
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,160
you know where to find specific tools

1497
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,599
review different docs how to build your

1498
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,079
own custom

1499
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,400
cali those little things are in there

1500
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,240
but we refer everything to the actually

1501
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,520
the cali's websites

1502
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,839
you know that are there um and the other

1503
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,040
thing too is that support

1504
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,400
admins will be able to support you

1505
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,680
better because that's the operating

1506
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,960
system that they'll be able to support

1507
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,800
you on you know in case you have any vpn

1508
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,599
issues

1509
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,040
any troubleshooting issues that you have

1510
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,800
getting into the lab environment or even

1511
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,160
accessing the lab environment

1512
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,440
that's the system that they'll be able

1513
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,960
to be able to understand and

1514
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,119
troubleshoot with you

1515
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,560
okay um question here is oscp

1516
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,880
a prerequisite for attempting osce

1517
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,839
i would think so personally myself um

1518
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,520
unfortunately there's no really road map

1519
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,680
to you know what to go after next

1520
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,119
you know for a specific course that

1521
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,200
offset has but i would say definitely if

1522
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,800
you want to get into exploit development

1523
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,960
go ahead and do osce if you want to be

1524
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,640
able to understand more web attacks

1525
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,800
understand white box web app pen testing

1526
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,000
definitely go ahead and take

1527
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,280
oswe or awae right um if you want to get

1528
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,960
into wireless do oswp

1529
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,560
like i said like i mentioned earlier it

1530
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,000
really depends on what you want to

1531
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,760
do next that offset security has for

1532
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,119
courses and also what cert you want to

1533
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,440
go for next that they have

1534
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,720
sweet uh if you currently have the old

1535
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,119
report and upgrade to the new pwk will

1536
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,640
the old report assume they're talking

1537
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,560
about the lab report qualify for five

1538
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,920
points or will they need to re-complete

1539
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,960
a new report

1540
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,319
uh to qualify for the five points i was

1541
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,000
actually waiting for this question yes

1542
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,520
it still counts for which

1543
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
uh so when you take your next exam that

1544
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,960
lab report that you did earlier that

1545
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,720
completed all the exercises on there

1546
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
and also the la also uh assessing the

1547
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,400
ten systems that still counts for your

1548
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,920
five points possibly

1549
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,040
once you submit it with your report

1550
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,480
sweet um question here about the exam

1551
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,160
can you use a multiple display setup

1552
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,680
during the exam or is it restricted to

1553
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,480
one screen only

1554
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,040
you can be able to use multiple displays

1555
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,160
for your exam

1556
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,400
the only thing i would totally recommend

1557
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,280
that you make sure

1558
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,720
is that the proctor is aware that you

1559
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,400
are using multiple screens

1560
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,079
because their software that they need to

1561
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,760
use will be able to review all screens

1562
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,440
of what you're doing for your assessment

1563
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,040
otherwise they could revoke your exam

1564
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,520
attempt

1565
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,040
sweet um anything proper specific

1566
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,680
wise exam takers should be aware of i

1567
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,760
hear the proctoring software is a chrome

1568
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,480
plugin

1569
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,240
should be okay to fill screen or vm or

1570
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,599
what we need to

1571
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,520
need the software visible on the host

1572
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,720
operating system

1573
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,200
i my recommendation is that is that when

1574
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,040
you are going to be starting your exam

1575
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,599
i would say go ahead and get your

1576
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,440
software set up 30 minutes before your

1577
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,240
exam

1578
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,000
and work with the proctor on that and

1579
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,520
see what the proctor says i don't really

1580
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,200
have a full answer for that

1581
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,280
um but i know that proctoring the

1582
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,480
proctoring team will have a better

1583
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,520
answer for you

1584
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,119
have a better answer for you when you do

1585
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,880
that

1586
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,079
there's one that's just coming here is

1587
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,000
there a minimum recommendation

1588
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,160
um yourself have you got a minimum

1589
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,520
recommendation of the amount of machines

1590
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,280
that you should hack out of 75 before

1591
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,839
attempting the exam

1592
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,880
very good question um

1593
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,880
i say that really like it's another

1594
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,240
depending question

1595
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,920
you know it depends really on you some

1596
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,440
people say the minimum you know systems

1597
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,599
that you need to assess is 30 machines

1598
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,640
however i say go through them all each

1599
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,480
system has its own different scenario

1600
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,839
its own different way of getting into

1601
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,359
the system and really it's a fun lab to

1602
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,240
be in

1603
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,400
you know you have systems with multiple

1604
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,920
domain controllers in different act you

1605
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,960
know different environments that you

1606
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,200
could

1607
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,160
assess and go into um so i'd say try to

1608
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,680
go through all of them as you can

1609
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,520
or at least you know go through as many

1610
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,800
systems as you can where you think you

1611
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,720
are comfortable to take the exam

1612
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,400
and if you have leftover lab time and

1613
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,240
you fail the exam that still gives you

1614
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,359
the opportunity to go through the other

1615
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,640
systems that are in the lab to help you

1616
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,520
prepare for your next exam attempt

1617
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,440
a question here about preparing for

1618
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,839
preparing for the oscp

1619
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,520
preparation is try hackney a

1620
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,319
a good platform to help with oscp and

1621
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,160
consequently is it hacked the box

1622
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,319
equally as good or as are view any other

1623
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,480
further recommendations

1624
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,160
this is uh this is a question i don't

1625
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,920
know if i really want to answer

1626
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,079
um because i feel like there's so many

1627
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,359
platforms that are out there that are

1628
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,480
trying to help prepare

1629
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,240
people for ocp um it's really kind of

1630
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:18,559
tough

1631
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,240
but it really also depends on you you

1632
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,400
know when i went through it myself

1633
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
i used you know vom hub and hacked the

1634
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,559
box as my preparations of myself you

1635
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:27,839
know to go ahead and

1636
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,520
you know prepare for the pwking exam

1637
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,040
that's why i have that list

1638
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,280
um but that really just depends on you

1639
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,640
and also the community's reviews on how

1640
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,280
they go through that

1641
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,960
okay um

1642
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,880
all right there's a there's a joke

1643
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,880
question in here so

1644
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,280
are there any industry recognized

1645
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,119
certifications that have a mantra of try

1646
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,160
less maybe tomorrow

1647
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,440
oh my god i don't know if i want to

1648
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,240
answer that question um

1649
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,160
a lot a lot of community has a bunch of

1650
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,680
different responses for that and i'll

1651
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,119
let the community answer that question

1652
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:05,440
for

1653
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,920
that person

1654
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,920
sweet uh

1655
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,160
i don't know if there's any other

1656
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,160
questions i i say i'll say that now

1657
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,880
there's gonna be about

1658
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,240
nine that will land in the next couple

1659
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,000
of seconds if anybody has under

1660
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,920
questions anybody can ask me

1661
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,559
you know um later i'm gonna be you know

1662
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,000
hanging out in the many hats club

1663
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,280
general voice chat

1664
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,640
so if anybody wants to ask me any

1665
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,920
questions on voice or in the general

1666
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,440
voice chat they can certainly do that if

1667
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,760
needed

1668
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,119
how long do you ideally spend on writing

1669
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,720
the report after you've sat the exam

1670
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,800
so i did the entire exam in report with

1671
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,160
a total of 38 hours

1672
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,040
um and that's really my fault uh because

1673
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,400
i really should have slept

1674
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,760
after i got i think i thought that i had

1675
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,800
enough points right

1676
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,440
you know to go through the exam um but

1677
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,280
that really depends on you

1678
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,359
and how you balance your time and how to

1679
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,400
go through it you know and that's

1680
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,599
something you can build off of

1681
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,160
okay uh what other

1682
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,000
uh mindset slash mantra uh do oscp

1683
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,839
provide other other than the legendary

1684
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,440
try harder

1685
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,440

a lot of people go through this course a

1737
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,960
lot and i know a lot of people struggle

1738
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,839

1739
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119

community that want to do this

1742
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,280
you know this is something i think you

1743
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,720
know everyone should try at least

1744
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,720
you know but the course is also not for

1745
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,000
everyone as well too

1746
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,680
but for you know if you have at least a

1747
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,880
good strong passion and a good

1748
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,680
understanding of what you need to

1749
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,119
prepare for for this course

1750
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,400
then you will definitely enjoy the

1751
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,319
course and learn from it and yeah you're

1752
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,440
going to stress you're going to struggle

1753
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,079
but

1754
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,599
um but most importantly i want to really

1755
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,960
thank the many hats club for having me

1756
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,559
on here speaking with you guys talking

1757
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:45,119
about

1758
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,800
you know the pwk and how to prepare for

1759
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
it um i know we're all going through

1760
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,480
some tough times right now but i know

1761
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,559
certainly that we'll get through it

1762
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,160
you know in the future as well too with

1763
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,319
this

1764
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,520
oh right questions are flown in again as

1765
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
one would think

1766
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,880
you should have escaped when you had the

1767
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,319
chance yeah i should have should have

1768
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:04,800
run

1769
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,960
uh does the oscp make sense for someone

1770
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,640
who is interested in getting into cloud

1771
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,760
security

1772
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,800
yes definitely i think for sure um you

1773
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,119
know

1774
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,599
as we now start seeing more systems move

1775
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,599
into the cloud right in aws

1776
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,240
and google suite and also um in digital

1777
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,119
ocean right

1778
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,400
we need to have people to be able to

1779
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,760
assess those systems that are in the

1780
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,359
cloud and those virtual private spaces

1781
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:26,559
as well too

1782
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:27,920
and i think it's really important you

1783
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,359
know at least to have that you know the

1784
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,200
fundamentals the hacker mindset that you

1785
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,640
take in the pwk

1786
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,319
it's definitely gonna help you apply

1787
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,079
that methodology and your concepts as

1788
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:36,960
well too

1789
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,559
going into those cloud environments as

1790
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,760
well that's a very good question

1791
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,240
uh probably last last question or so and

1792
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,000
then we can transition over to

1793
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,040
stu uh how did the oscp help

1794
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,079
getting into the job field it really

1795
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:52,640
helped me

1796
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,800
i i will say that um in order for me to

1797
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,079
be a pen tester um

1798
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,000
in the private sector where i was um

1799
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,079
it definitely opened a lot of doors for

1800
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,520
me one once i obtained that cert and

1801
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,800
earned it properly

1802
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,720
um and also in fairness as well with it

1803
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,559
so um

1804
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,280
once i immediately got my oscp i was

1805
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,640
hired on two weeks later to be a

1806
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,000
pentester in the private sector team

1807
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,880
that i worked for

1808
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,559
and really i enjoyed working with that

1809
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,559
team ever since and also working with

1810
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,880
the offset guys as well too
