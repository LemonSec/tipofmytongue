1
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,640
[Music]

2
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
he's a senior penetration tester and

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
software engineer

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,559
he's the ceo of white dragon

5
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,280
and he has extensive experience with

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,800
breaking applications

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,239
and various other sorts of targets

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,960
so according to mike it only takes 20

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,440
seconds to hack most universities across

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,399
north america so this talk is going to

11
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,559
focus on how to find vulnerabilities in

12
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,680
their systems

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,480
and how to chain exploits blindly to own

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,680
the system based on real world examples

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
so this looks like it's going to be an

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
exciting talk so

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
uh take it away mike yeah

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,479
thanks for having me and uh excited to

19
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,280
give this

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,479
uh a little bit about who am i

21
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,759
a ceo winter dragon i used to be a lead

22
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,880
security engineer

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,960
systems administrator software engineer

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
my business does uh web application

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,439
attacks

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,000
penetration and also the defense side of

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,280
it

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
and it's uh also handle stuff like

29
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,040
denial of service attacks

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,439
and i've been doing this for over 10

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,119
years now in total

32
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,640
so a fun thing to do

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
a little brief agenda on this one i'll

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
talk about scanning over 80 universities

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
across north america uh finding

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,560
vulnerabilities blindly in them

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,680
and chaining them together automatically

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,079
and then rooting all the boxes in about

39
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,200
20 seconds

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
all blindly all automatically

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,160
uh so for scanning

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
i targeted universities and colleges in

43
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,920
north america

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,319
specifically the

45
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,160
universities and colleges around here

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
they usually have uh pretty outdated

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,800
systems

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,080
with just getting uh facelifts

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,360
uh upon uh initial inspection i notice

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
they a lot of them are using a custom

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
sas software looks like a

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
php in a custom framework

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,680
i dug into the vendor of it

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,120
and i noticed that they also have other

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,840
other customers who are like regular

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
shops and stores

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,920
so i found 150 customers affected just

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,040
with the

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,640
google doors and i was able to find over

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,280
500

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,480
000 people's information 15 years worth

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,120
of data

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
sales all your information even uh

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
credit card details that were sitting

65
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,519
there that no one's patched

66
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,159
so i i think of uh

67
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,760
security when uh chain

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,959
finding steps to make the

69
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,480
exploit so a little curl here

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,080
which i found two things apache 2 4

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,280
25 and the set cookie

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,959
is giving me the php session id

73
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,959
and i log that down because it's

74
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,239
probably going to be useful

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,239
and one of the first things i always

76
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,000
start doing is i go ahead and i

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,720
open that derb or go bust or any of

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,439
those

79
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,799
and start scanning for obvious urls

80
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,879
and in here i notice there's the

81
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,000
standard about us

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,799
pages but then there's an admin link

83
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,200
code

84
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,440
200 size 5590

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,720
and upon accessing it the admin panel

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,918
pops up

87
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,800
and as we all know it's definitely best

88
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
practice to leave your admin panel

89
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,080
exposed to the world

90
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,599
because that's just inviting us

91
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,240
and my goal is to make it into the admin

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,280
panel

93
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,680
and some questions i threw up like what

94
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,199
does the min panel look like

95
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,639
do i have to use you know internet

96
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,840
explorer or any

97
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,759
other old outdated tech to access it

98
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,440
and what vulnerabilities are on the

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,680
inside

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
i'm going in blindly so i'm not sure

101
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,400
what it's going to look like so

102
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,638
now i start doing some scanning

103
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,639
first obvious target on this one is i

104
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,320
tried the classic

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,600
cross-site scripting with the user agent

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
now half of me prayed this wasn't

107
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,000
uh possible and isn't going to work but

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,160
i tried it anyways and i targeted the

109
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,280
admin url

110
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,600
i thought if they're going to be

111
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
monitoring anything

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,320
and they left their admin page open to

113
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,280
the world

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
it's either a honeypot or they're

115
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
actually

116
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,320
you know allowing people to sign into

117
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,960
the admin remotely

118
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,039
so i sent away the curl request here

119
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,160
and about a day later i got back

120
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
a hit on the cross-site scripting

121
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
from someone viewing the page i found

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,120
their php session id cookie

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,520
and the url addresses for all the

124
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
internal admin pages

125
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,960
that were available and this is what it

126
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
looks like

127
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,080
it's got a bunch of configuration

128
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,919
settings email settings

129
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,600
uh raw file manager as well as

130
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
you know all 10 plus years of email

131
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,919
history

132
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,400
how they plan their courses out and all

133
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,360
these

134
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,880
internal systems just exposed to the web

135
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,960
i could look at emails from 15 years ago

136
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,520
that are just being scraped off of old

137
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
archives

138
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
i could also look at emails that were

139
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,759
being sent like

140
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,560
your shipment order your order has been

141
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
received your course is purchased and

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,359
all this other stuff

143
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,199
so i started wondering to myself what

144
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,080
else can we do in here

145
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,280
so i took another stab i deployed a

146
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,479
lan scanner to probe their internal

147
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,840
network

148
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,160
um i looked for all the links that i

149
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,199
could possibly

150
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
crawl i recorded content in iframes and

151
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,919
just dump them

152
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,080
and post the results back to my control

153
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,759
server

154
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,800
i found a bunch of hosts on the network

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,199
and i found also vulnerable things like

156
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,639
point-of-sale machines

157
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,919
point-of-sale printers and all these

158
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,319
other

159
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,840
iot devices on it

160
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
so from the

161
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,080
cross-site scripting i have their php

162
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
session id

163
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,440
and i started wondering is it

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,319
exploitable

165
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,280
because they're giving it out and most

166
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
most systems by default

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,120
aren't going to give you the php session

168
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
id

169
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
so i'm going to try to set a random id

170
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,000
to see if i can get the server to give

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,639
me that session

172
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,120
so i tried on the admin page where i saw

173
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,840
assessed

174
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,280
id parameter if you go from http

175
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,919
it'll upgrade you to https and give you

176
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
that parameter with your session token

177
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,400
and in here i make the request and i see

178
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,879
the set cookie comes back as exactly the

179
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,599
cookie

180
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,560
uh exactly the session id i entered

181
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,199
so i'm thinking this may be one way in

182
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,800
but it's pretty manual

183
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
so i'm not convinced i want to go in

184
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,279
this way

185
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,440
so i start probing around

186
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
and i find include directories in all

187
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,200
these systems

188
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,040
that have standard files like

189
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,399
authentication in them

190
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,839
given the system is already effectively

191
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,519
giving me a way and if the section's

192
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,279
still active

193
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,440
i'm going to craft a simple sql

194
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
injection and see where it leads me

195
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,240
and it didn't work as i expected

196
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,399
the main admin login page

197
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,240
just gave me invalid username or

198
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,440
password so

199
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,720
they're using some basic filtering there

200
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,480
and because i didn't want to set off too

201
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
many alarms i took my time

202
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
and i started scanning again for other

203
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,519
directories

204
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
so i noticed they have some http basic

205
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
authentication going on

206
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,040
it looks like older legacy systems

207
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,240
so i'm wondering is it vulnerable to

208
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
like a blind sql injection in the http

209
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,880
basic authentication

210
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,560
so here's my payload simple

211
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,000
postgresql syntax just

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
trying to break the query intentionally

213
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,839
assuming it's running a query

214
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,760
and it turns out it is the page

215
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,560
immediately broke with httpr 500

216
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,239
and it could not finish the request

217
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,079
so knowing that there's a sql injection

218
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,440
here that's blind

219
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,079
a lot of automated tools like sql map

220
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,040
can't

221
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,160
easily test

222
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
sql injection in http basic

223
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
authentication

224
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,959
it's hard to do so i went for something

225
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,839
different

226
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,240
can i get a local file inclusion or

227
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,480
remote command execution from it

228
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,040
and with the bit of probing i figured

229
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,519
out it's using postgresql

230
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
so postgresql comes with some

231
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
basic functions that are enabled like

232
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,839
you create a table called hacks with a

233
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,000
description field and you can copy

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,399
into the hacks table the accept password

235
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,760
file

236
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
you can copy you know the site's enabled

237
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,079
file and then you can

238
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,640
select all that content from the

239
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,839
database

240
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,160
that table you just created

241
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,680
but upon probing

242
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,880
the cms sas software that these

243
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,640
companies are using is exposing

244
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,480
a table called frontend the front end is

245
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,880
just

246
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,320
all the contents of their website so

247
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
while i could try to brute force my way

248
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,760
blindly

249
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,279
to get the data i could also render it

250
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,880
right to their home page

251
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,480
so copy into the front page content from

252
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,640
accept password

253
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,839
curl prep for root to start and get 80

254
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,000
lines above and below it

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
into accept password content

256
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,839
and this is what showed up all their set

257
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,079
password for their system

258
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,160
and i also was able to get a bunch of

259
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,279
other data

260
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,680
on demand including the source code of

261
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,920
the files

262
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,959
and just dump them to the front page

263
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,360
of the universities or any page that

264
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,000
existed

265
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
and now that i've got my uh scan

266
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,200
done here i got the database field names

267
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,279
i know how the authentication works

268
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,279
and now i'm going to create myself an

269
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,680
admin account

270
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,360
and for bobby tables bobby drop tables

271
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,279
so i make my sql syntax

272
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,959
and i start my login i enter the login

273
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,839
information

274
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,279
and there was no encryption on the

275
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,040
passwords at the time because they had

276
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,079
it intentionally disabled

277
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,320
and i got my own backdoor account into

278
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,399
it

279
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,079
and the backdoor account now i can view

280
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,279
all the information

281
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
on my own without having to just pray

282
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
for cross-site scripting to execute

283
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
i can view all the logs the staff

284
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,680
information and modify that same website

285
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,399
contents

286
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
from their back end

287
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,920
and now i want to automate it

288
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,040
i can change everything that i've built

289
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
here so far to be automated i'm going to

290
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,240
use the user agent cross-site scripting

291
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,920
i'm going to change usernames and

292
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,360
passwords so i can impersonate

293
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,480
legitimate users

294
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,079
and i'm going to spoof the legitimate

295
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,240
administrator who did the uh

296
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,480
who executed the payload

297
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,639
so this is my uh first iteration

298
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,399
a basic javascript sending it over

299
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,440
i get the session id create an account

300
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,839
and post it and a big issue with this

301
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,240
one

302
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,440
is because in doing it from the

303
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,120
cross-site scripting of the user

304
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,959
um it in system logs

305
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,120
until further investigation will look

306
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,000
like that

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,839
legitimate user did these tasks

308
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,959
so it helps throw off initial tricks

309
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
when i start probing it i see like their

310
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
session management system

311
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,519
when i go there i immediately got hit

312
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,720
with my own cross-site scripting attack

313
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,399
so this is the page which was vulnerable

314
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,920
it allows them to watch you know the

315
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,760
user sessions in real time

316
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,600
and can view all the users info their

317
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,800
their uh personal information

318
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,360
everything was there including card

319
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,279
information except for their password

320
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,560
their password was filtered

321
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,638
out

322
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,000
and this is how that page looked you can

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,920
search for the date range

324
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,399
how long they were there when they

325
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,560
stopped how many clicks the last path

326
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,839
and if they were logged in

327
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
there was also an order management panel

328
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
which was really interesting

329
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,519
you could view order information the

330
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,639
name the email

331
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,000
the number how much paid

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,199
and the administrator can refund anyone

333
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
online

334
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,279
and i was thinking refunding online

335
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,519
they're either going to do it two ways

336
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,000
try to post a negative transaction or

337
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
if the the payment processor

338
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
will support a proper refund

339
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,959
it'll do it that way so i tested my luck

340
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,079
and i tried to give a refund to bobby

341
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,399
drop tables for their 27

342
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,560
order with a 995 dollar refund

343
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,000
and it went through but was

344
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,839
quickly pulled back after about an hour

345
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,639
so it looks like they're just trying to

346
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,800
do a negative transaction back into your

347
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
account

348
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,279
now i'm going to go for root

349
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,519
so probing there's a configuration

350
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,959
editor and it allows you to

351
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,839
edit the raw php configuration on it

352
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,240
so i just put in my payload

353
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,440
netcat and i got the www data user from

354
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
it

355
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,079
and there's many other things i can do

356
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,360
from that

357
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,079
but for now i've got full admin account

358
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,759
sql injection

359
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,800
a shell as the data user

360
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,920
i can elevate on routes to this on the

361
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,720
servers

362
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,279
because the kernel is vulnerable their

363
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,480
whole distribution

364
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,599
server for back for products

365
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,359
was also vulnerable to the same exploit

366
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,280
so i can also back door all the future

367
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,359
product releases

368
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,439
and their client source code was there

369
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,439
too so i can put malicious source code

370
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,599
on their desktop applications

371
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
as well

372
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,000
so with my shell i just went ahead and i

373
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,959
created a

374
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,160
admin page here and i just dumped it

375
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
into the admin directory

376
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,120
and upon loading it it gave me my exact

377
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,080
contents

378
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,160
so it looks like they're scraping

379
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,080
anything in the admin directory

380
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,840
dynamically and trying to include it

381
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,200
and now i'm going to dump the databases

382
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,160
because i have the rce and the database

383
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,919
credentials are hard coded in the config

384
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,440
files

385
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,840
i'm going to dump all the data from

386
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,320
everyone

387
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,360
so using pg dump gzip and

388
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,480
scp-ing it out and removing the copy

389
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,320
here's one with 264 megs of data

390
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,600
and this was just for uh

391
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,520
time period of one month of their data

392
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,679
and that contained everything in their

393
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,039
system

394
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,760
everyone's information all the logs

395
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,799
transactions

396
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,039
history everything that was there it's

397
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,840
here

398
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,000
and so a recap on this

399
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,120
i got the copy of the database got all

400
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
the password hashes

401
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,240
some of them are hash some of them

402
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
weren't there's a configuration

403
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,520
options to remove it uh the user

404
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,600
information all the order details

405
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,320
enough enough that with some reasonable

406
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
effort you could easily

407
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,360
steal a lot of people's identities

408
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
i'm in backdoor and then deleting some

409
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,160
of the evidence we were in the system

410
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
five exploits were used to go from

411
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
unauthenticated user to

412
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,120
full shell and now it's time to automate

413
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,799
this to hack all the other

414
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,559
universities running the software

415
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,960
and here it is about a dozen lines of

416
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
javascript

417
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
automated everything including sending

418
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,039
the data creating the back door

419
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,400
and launching a shell

420
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,840
and all it takes is someone to review a

421
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,360
session and with a bit of social

422
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
engineering you can get it triggered

423
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,919
almost quickly

424
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,600
just call them up say you're having an

425
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,960
issue with their website

426
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
they'll go in and review your session

427
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,840
and the payload is hit

428
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,960
and uh i want to touch a brief a bit

429
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,600
about

430
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
how this could have been prevented

431
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,960
uh proactive monitoring

432
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,840
google dorks found all the bunner bill

433
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,000
hosts

434
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
and there's many automated tools that

435
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,200
will let you do this

436
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,400
when i was probing i could enter any

437
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,240
sort of payload into it

438
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,280
there was no application firewall

439
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,000
there was no monitoring there was no

440
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,120
there was nothing

441
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,080
in place that would give anyone any clue

442
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,039
i was in the system

443
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,640
unless i did something completely

444
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,760
obvious like crash the entire server

445
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
but even at that they probably just

446
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,080
rebooted

447
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,280
and dropping the session id sending

448
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,039
they're explicitly sending out the

449
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,039
session ids

450
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,280
and that's just asking for session

451
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,760
hijacks on this one

452
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,480
they can be removed and there's no

453
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,799
legitimate reason in my opinion

454
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,120
to inject a snap an id in this case

455
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,159
or or really in any cases even upgrading

456
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,400
http to https

457
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,360
you should be fortunate https already

458
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
clearly they failed their regular audits

459
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,039
or they've never been audited before

460
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,159
by anyone because they need proper

461
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,520
security audits

462
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,720
and this just looks and smells like some

463
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,760
black box

464
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,360
pci compliance audit or some attestation

465
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,760
of compliance without any real auditing

466
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
uh their developers need to test their

467
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,120
own code and their pierce code

468
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,919
like it looks like no one bothered to

469
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,480
test

470
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,400
or they just have a lot of garbage

471
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
hanging around that

472
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,440
everyone forgot to remove anything from

473
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,919
the oauth top 10 or cheat sheets

474
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,960
would be good to start

475
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,039
and this should go without saying

476
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,240
but please don't make your admin panel

477
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
public to the world

478
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,559
you know whitelist access by piece to

479
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,919
trusted origins if you really need to

480
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,080
but it should just be internal user

481
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,720
ranges only

482
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,679
and all these admin pages were indexed

483
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,760
by google

484
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
you know at least try to hide your admin

485
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,039
page from the world if you're going to

486
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,840
leave it open

487
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,720
and i figured out when testing

488
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,039
there was only two types of accounts

489
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:35,919
there was

490
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,240
you know customer user accounts and

491
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,720
there was administrator accounts

492
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,600
there's no access control on them so if

493
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,919
i just had a regular admin account

494
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,559
i could do anything that you know the

495
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,320
super administrator and the business

496
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,280
administrator could

497
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
unfortunately most organizations like

498
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,600
the universities

499
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
they don't at least on their web front

500
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,280
they haven't

501
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
implemented a lot of the proper access

502
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
controls or they have a

503
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
baggage hanging around that'll let you

504
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,240
just circumvent them

505
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,679
so taking that away and leaving it out

506
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,840
would be the proper solution to that

507
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,640
and if you're gonna keep your session

508
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
ids at least have some other

509
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,720
forms of authentication like you know

510
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
single sign-on

511
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
and have some two-factor authentication

512
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,799
going on

513
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,760
the systems that were hijacked here for

514
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,600
the universities had two-factor

515
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,039
authentication

516
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,200
all the accounts hadn't enabled but

517
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
because the session id

518
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
allowed me to jump through it they

519
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
pinned your two-factor authentication

520
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,039
success to your session but they didn't

521
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,640
check any differences like

522
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,039
if you're accessing it with curl versus

523
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,080
the web browser

524
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,039
or your ip or your country none of these

525
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,200
basic security fields were

526
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,559
bothered to be checked

527
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,159
so definitely checking all those is a

528
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,640
is a good way to start uh blocking this

529
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,360
and it's not full it's not foolproof but

530
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
you know two-factor authentication

531
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,279
multi-factor authentication it's

532
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,480
definitely a step that

533
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
all these all these places need to get

534
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
implemented

535
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,440
and because the universities and

536
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,200
colleges and all these other shops we're

537
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,320
using third-party vendors

538
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
you know you've got to check out what

539
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,960
your vendor's security is

540
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,480
and make sure your vendors are

541
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,320
undergoing some audits

542
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,720
make sure you know they're not just

543
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,400
saying hair stuff secure

544
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,320
take the time and actually test their

545
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,840
stuff do some basic

546
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,880
uh tests on it and see if it's actually

547
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,159
secure

548
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,360
now if you can just put you know some

549
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,080
basic sql breaking syntax and then it

550
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,799
breaks

551
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,559
you know this isn't the vendor you need

552
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,039
to go with

553
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,559
and controversially you know

554
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,360
fully fully understand the risks of the

555
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,760
environment you're exposing

556
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,960
in this case all all these people's

557
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,400
personal information

558
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,840
you know up to 15 years old worth of

559
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,640
data

560
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,000
was available so limiting how much data

561
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,520
you actually keep in store and

562
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,158
limiting what functionality is available

563
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,320
and that's that's it on my uh

564
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,840
my side here is there any questions

565
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,080
all right well i'll jump in and uh thank

566
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,720
you

567
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,919
for a pretty awesome presentation

568
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,840
so it's really scary how many things are

569
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,880
vulnerable like

570
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,240
i don't work as a red teamer

571
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,440
or pen tester

572
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
so i mainly write about i learn about

573
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,880
exploits when i write about them

574
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,240
but to listen to someone whose security

575
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
tests

576
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,400
talk about very specific vulnerabilities

577
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,840
and exploits

578
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,840
it always kind of hits me emotionally

579
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,159
that is certainly true i guess my

580
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,039
question for you

581
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,159
is universities have this gigantic

582
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,919
estate and arguably one of the most

583
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,279
hostile networking

584
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,559
environments uh known to mankind because

585
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,600
you know this is

586
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,200
a lot of them have computer science

587
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
programs and they're all out

588
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,640
kind of for blood have you seen any sort

589
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,039
of

590
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,039
extra uh effort to isolate or segment

591
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,080
these networks

592
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,919
because i mean you laterally moved

593
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,120
through the entire

594
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,159
network without so much as you know

595
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,880
any sort of like pause or or concern

596
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,520
yeah yeah there i've seen some which

597
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,799
have made the effort

598
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,240
but a lot of them are

599
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,520
they they'll set up like a few vms for

600
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,600
their vendors to put the software on

601
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,679
but not actually apply any proper

602
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,520
firewall policies or anything

603
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,960
so moving moving laterally through

604
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
the entire network is becoming easier

605
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,279
and easier but there's some

606
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,640
uh there's a few bigger universities uh

607
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,880
in uh north america that i've tested and

608
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,279
the

609
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,440
max i've got is like you know basic

610
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,120
cross-site scripting and they handle

611
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,000
those

612
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,279
within a few seconds well realistically

613
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,159
a few minutes

614
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,440
but they're very quick but any

615
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,480
i find anyone really leveraging

616
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,600
vendors it's this slow process there's

617
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,159
going to be

618
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,320
lots of vulnerabilities that are just

619
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,520
obvious

620
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,159
if you just take the you know 20 seconds

621
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,039
to

622
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,480
test them now do you are you finding

623
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,960
that this

624
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,840
is because of the uh because the

625
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,760
universities are like vpn is too

626
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,440
expensive vpn is

627
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,760
too complicated we're just going to put

628
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,559
this stuff

629
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,000
right out there is it is it lazy

630
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,399
yeah i think half of it it's it's

631
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,279
laziness

632
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,039
or or the vendor has a

633
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,159
this strange requirement like uh one

634
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,240
vendor they uh

635
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,799
i know if they don't have any jump box

636
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,880
or anything so they want you know direct

637
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,760
public ssh access into all these

638
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,399
machines

639
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,080
without anything oh my god why it's

640
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,159
almost a honeypot

641
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,200
exactly yeah um

642
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,000
so are you also seeing a lot of like out

643
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,559
of date

644
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,440
unpatched stuff uh or has that gotten a

645
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
little bit better

646
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,159
uh it's gotten a little bit better but

647
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:08,960
uh

648
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,159
you know like one of the things i'm

649
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,840
happy to report is one of the

650
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,520
universities here

651
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,159
just three weeks ago they finally killed

652
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,399
off a server exposed to the public

653
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,559
running php4

654
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,159
wow which is long since out of date yeah

655
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,279
yeah so i have a question

656
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,360
how often is outdated

657
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,559
or legacy technology a factor

658
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,279
and how easy these academic institutions

659
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,840
can be that's what

660
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,600
yeah um a lot of the software that i

661
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,279
find i'm running on the web

662
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,320
is outdated and i think

663
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
half of it is just because

664
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,279
when software changes especially any big

665
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,520
braking changes not only do they have to

666
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,279
test them but they also have to train

667
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,799
the entire staff team

668
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,039
and how much time do you want to spend

669
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,840
let's say you know

670
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,840
you have 500 staff who need to use it

671
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,960
and something changes

672
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,440
now you have to teach 500 staff members

673
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,720
what change

674
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,039
versus if you just keep the one software

675
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,640
they're trained on

676
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,279
you know they're accepting a risk that

677
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,559
vulnerabilities

678
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,679
are going to arise because they're not

679
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,120
willing to pay the price

680
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,679
of the upgrade and teaching the staff

681
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,799
how to use it

682
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,159
so it's always a trade-off that's very

683
