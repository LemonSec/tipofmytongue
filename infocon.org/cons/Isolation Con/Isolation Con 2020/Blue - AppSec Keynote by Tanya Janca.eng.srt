18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,030
I'm going to talk to you about securing

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,160
modern apps so there's lots of old stuff

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,050
and there's lots of old types of apps

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,460
and we're not going to talk about any of

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,930
that we're only going to talk about cool

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,989
new things and how to secure that so I'm

24
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,539
not gonna cover you know a regular web

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,939
app and all the old-school things I'm

26
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,439
not going to talk about memory safety or

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,360
any of that I'm going to talk about API

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,439
is maker services cloud things like that

29
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,030
people are changing the way their apps

30
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,470
are changing our tech stacks are

31
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,119
changing and we as security people need

32
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,350
to change and that's what this talk is

33
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,290
about so with that what are we going to

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,909
talk about today we're gonna talk about

35
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,210
red team which is offensive security

36
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,140
we're going to talk about blue team

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,540
which is defensive security we're going

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,310
to talk about purple team which I like

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,110
to call collaborative security I'm gonna

40
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,750
rant about hackers and have lots of

41
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,930
people see us like this I don't see us

42
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,659
like this this is not what I see when I

43
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,180
see other security professionals this is

44
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,220
what I see yes as helping each other as

45
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,219
protecting people for me what we do is

46
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,250
very noble I believe what the work that

47
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,890
we do is good like Superman does good

48
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,100
and so this is the way I see things and

49
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,810
you're gonna see a huge slant of that

50
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,520
throughout this talk and basically every

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,390
talk I ever give but with that let's do

52
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,700
the mandatory about me slide so this is

53
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,290
the slide that every speaker gives

54
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,610
because we want you to know we're

55
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,920
qualified to get from talk so I said

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,650
previously i'm tahni djenka I like punk

57
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,080
rock on the Internet I'm known as she

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,360
hacks purple we'll talk about purple

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,640
team today that's what this talks about

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,209
and I am one of the founders of whoa

61
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,620
sack women of security I love a wasp and

62
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,629
this huge fan of a predictive chapter

63
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,209
I'm totally obsessed with that community

64
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,000
and I'm a security trainer and coach at

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,129
my own startup called she acts purple

66
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:52,349
Deb and lastly I'm Canadian I thought I

67
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,420
would add that in there for fun anyway

68
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,980
thanks for coming to my talk I know

69
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,870
there's two other amazing talks on the

70
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,180
other tracks right now but let's learn

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,800
some app sex okay so this is the plan so

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,390
I like to like tell everyone what I'm

73
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,159
going to tell them and then throughout

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,930
the talk I tell them of the things I'm

75
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,340
going to tell them and then after I'll

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,140
tell you what I told you so I like to

77
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,400
summarize and make sure that you can

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,620
take away as much as possible from those

79
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,980
55 minutes so modern approaches the app

80
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,590
sex so the first one is oh my gosh it

81
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,659
turns out we need soft skills if we want

82
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,810
to be good at security oh no then the

83
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,750
next one is we're going to talk about

84
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,670
security tactics for modern apps Oh

85
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,150
strategies and tactics tooling all sorts

86
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,760
of different ways that we can do things

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,450
briefly we're going to talk about

88
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,319
automating boring stuff because you as a

89
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,019
security person shouldn't use a tech

90
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,879
person I'm a person that rates code a

91
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,590
person works at 19 you should never do

92
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,000
something manually more than two or

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,489
three times when you could automate it

94
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,590
and then we're going to talk about

95
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,540
continuous learning so you come into

96
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,120
isolation con or you joining the many

97
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,830
Hat clubs which I totally think you

98
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,470
should do that's part of your continuous

99
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,030
learning and we're going to talk about

100
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,220
more different ways that we can continue

101
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,970
to learn and perfect and hone our skills

102
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,580
because when you stop learning you're

103
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,989
not going to be awesome at your job

104
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,000
anymore and you chose tech because you

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,459
wanted a challenge so we're gonna talk

106
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,660
about how you can make sure you keep

107
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,330
meeting

108
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,819
challenges with let's get purple and

109
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,460
start our talk okay so first of all I'm

110
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,159
gonna give you a few definitions if you

111
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,629
already know those please forgive me

112
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,330
it's just I don't know the level of

113
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,439
knowledge of every single person that's

114
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,389
joining us and I'd rather spend two or

115
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,099
three minutes invested at the beginning

116
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:40,689
to make sure everyone can come along for

117
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:43,719
the entire top so first what is

118
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,819
application security and why does she

119
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,069
call it app sec because there's too many

120
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:51,430
syllables that's why so what is

121
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,460
applications carry it is any and every

122
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,229
activity that you do to make sure your

123
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,569
software is secure it give me formal

124
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:01,449
things it could be Oh someone's paying

125
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:02,770
something in the chat that's really

126
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:09,280
distracting it's it could be you hiring

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,229
someone to do a secure code or the you

128
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,659
know are you doing it yourself it could

129
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:15,490
be you grepping through source code and

130
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,900
looking for something that you know was

131
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,639
a problem and one app and then checking

132
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,889
the rest apps to see if it's there it

133
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,270
could be you updating your framework

134
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,439
because you know there's a big

135
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,900
vulnerability out any of the things that

136
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,729
you do to make sure your software secure

137
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:32,370
as part of toxic and who said that me

138
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,810
you know we should quote ourselves but I

139
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,900
don't care so what is that sec ups then

140
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,710
right basically it's up SEC in a devops

141
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,930
environment so if you're doing devops

142
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,789
you should be doing your job securely if

143
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:49,120
you're doing software development you

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,860
should be doing your job as securely as

145
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,250
you know how to do it right but def SEC

146
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,379
Ops is us upset people adjusting

147
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:58,539
ourselves so that we can weave our

148
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,240
activities or our goals through your

149
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,370
DevOps environment your processes all

150
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,150
the things that you're doing and still

151
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,740
compliment you instead of stopping and

152
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,810
breaking all your stuff but with the

153
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,789
same goals that we always have to make

154
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,219
sure you reliably release high quality

155
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:18,370
very secure software and my friend

156
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,919
Cameron said that he's totally awesome

157
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,229
okay so now I'm gonna more definition so

158
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,509
what is red team so you've probably

159
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:27,339
heard of red team a lot more than you've

160
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:29,020
heard of blue or purple to you so let's

161
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,599
start with them so red team our

162
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,540
attackers their offense

163
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,640
security and I don't mean they point and

164
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,900
swear

165
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,260
so it's adversarial style testing often

166
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,640
done against prod they find real risks

167
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,440
so penetration testing writing exploits

168
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,020
doing a red team exercise where you

169
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,390
attack production systems and then see

170
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,360
where they fare for instance chaos

171
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,100
engineering all of this would be part of

172
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,280
red team it would be under that side of

173
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,640
things so now there's blue team blue

174
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,860
team are defenders they are our

175
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,680
protectors they're the ones that are

176
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,080
cheering that we have defenses and that

177
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,280
they're set up correctly and that

178
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,200
they're the right defenses they're

179
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,560
monitoring logging alerting patching

180
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,750
responding doing all the things to try

181
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,020
to shield us and then now purple so I

182
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,900
consider purple team collaboration

183
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,370
empathy and advocacy and I'm gonna

184
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,430
explain what I mean by those I realize

185
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,990
this is a woman giving this talk so

186
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,400
you're probably oh god just gonna talk

187
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,550
about hugs and Care Bears and I might

188
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,200
but that's not what most this talk it's

189
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,420
about just to be clear okay so what is

190
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,180
purple team so some people say it's red

191
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,090
team plus blue team and I do agree that

192
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,240
it's got mixtures of both I believe that

193
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,150
we are collaborators we're co-operators

194
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,660
and we are communicators so we are that

195
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,500
bridge in between the security team and

196
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,140
the dev and ops team we are that team

197
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,020
that makes sure that they can still get

198
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,940
their jobs done but we weave our

199
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,530
security through everything they're

200
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,880
doing and support them and make sure

201
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,040
they get there so we are teaching

202
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,430
providing tools we do everything we can

203
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,130
to make sure they get to the finish line

204
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,660
with a secure app I believe that we have

205
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,120
to advocate for both developers and

206
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,390
security and walk that line of being

207
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,830
interested and supporting of both I

208
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,150
believe purple team is app sec as a

209
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,789
whole it's a giant umbrella and Blue

210
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,070
Team and Red Team are underneath it all

211
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,500
of the activities of app sec add up to

212
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,310
purple

213
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,120
so what - purple team members do so they

214
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,460
hold consultations with developers so

215
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,810
rather than saying this is the new

216
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,970
standard and you must follow it they

217
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,500
meet with everyone and talk with them

218
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,140
and ask if it's actually possible they

219
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,710
provide guidance assistance resources

220
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,260
writings like written materials anything

221
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,850
that they can to make sure that

222
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,500
developers have the things they need

223
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,750
they give them actual tools and by that

224
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,330
I mean like security tools or making

225
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,150
sure that they're allowed more plugins

226
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,580
in their browsers that they need so they

227
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,960
can do their testing and ensuring that

228
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,339
those tools that they have are secure

229
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,290
like not just that they're security

230
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,120
tools but the those tools aren't going

231
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,500
to cause problems for the rest of your

232
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,589
network sometimes they create tools

233
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,390
sometimes they raid their own they

234
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,980
create documentation that's actually

235
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,810
readable and understandable and written

236
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,730
in developer words instead of in

237
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,850
security team's words so a knapsack

238
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,760
person wouldn't write session IDs are

239
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,210
ephemeral that is useless and that is

240
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,089
useless information a software developer

241
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,550
needs to know a session ID needs to be

242
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,060
at least 64 characters preferably 128 it

243
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,940
needs to be unique created with a

244
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,970
high-quality random number generator it

245
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,860
needs to be destroyed every time you log

246
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,710
out or after X amount of activity etc it

247
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,420
needs to be extremely explicit and then

248
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,500
they will run off and build you a

249
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,240
kickass piece of software that does that

250
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,400
but if you say it's ephemeral that means

251
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,720
it's short-lived like what does that

252
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,780
mean so we need accessible information

253
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,850
written in their words not ours and we

254
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,830
need to advocate for both sides so

255
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,600
sometimes developers have a really tight

256
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,610
deadline but also we can't release

257
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,320
things that are well too insecure and

258
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,089
sometimes we have to meet in the middle

259
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,400
and it's our job to make sure we aren't

260
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,589
completely biased only one way or only

261
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,850
the other which can be hard sometimes

262
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,950
yes I'm just going to repeat that this

263
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,010
is why we have to have empathy um you

264
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,390
can be an abstract professional if

265
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,459
you've never written a line of code in

266
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,830
your life but you cannot be an abstract

267
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,110
professional if you don't give a crap

268
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,540
about the developers and what they're

269
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,070
trying to get done and their deadlines

270
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,850
and their job

271
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,490
fireman's so we have to advocate for

272
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,100
both sides not just one and it is my

273
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,050
belief that purple team is a modern

274
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,360
approach to application security we used

275
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,440
to have two silos security over here

276
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,690
yelling at the devs saying no a lot

277
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,519
Deb's over here hiding under tables

278
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,250
avoiding the security team that was me

279
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,880
you and I as a dev I was like okay so

280
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,610
what do I mean my advocacy right what do

281
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,279
I mean by that so the technical

282
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,130
definition of advocacy is public support

283
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,480
we're like recommendations towards a

284
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,110
cause or a policy so in our case we're

285
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,269
going to support like with tools with

286
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:44,079
time with advice with you know like our

287
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,940
technical activities we're going to

288
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,870
support the cause of making sure we have

289
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,819
secure software and making sure our devs

290
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,860
can do their job securely and the

291
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,079
policies of our workplace those security

292
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,509
policies and definitely we need some

293
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,339
security policies and regard to software

294
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,199
so that the devs know what we want from

295
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:04,870
them that is another thing so advocacy

296
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,779
is showing support and recommendation

297
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,060
for so all of our recommendations are in

298
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,449
line with the things that we support

299
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:15,579
okay so here are some principles for

300
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:19,350
success in your advocacy

301
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,089
okay so the first one is self service

302
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,120
whenever possible make anything you have

303
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,949
self service for devs they don't want to

304
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:28,920
wait on you don't be a bottleneck

305
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,420
anything that you can make on it like

306
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,699
whether it be automated or just whatever

307
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,019
you can do so that they can serve

308
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:37,569
themselves will save you time and make

309
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:42,519
them feel independent we need to make

310
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,990
sure they can trust us so whatever you

311
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,699
can do to build trust and this

312
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,949
definitely means holding their

313
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:50,019
confidentiality so sometimes people will

314
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,500
report things to you and it'll be their

315
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,060
teammates or their friends or all these

316
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,560
other people it's really really

317
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,759
important they know that they can trust

318
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,350
you with that information and you're not

319
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,250
gonna make them regret it it's important

320
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,990
we remember they're human beings

321
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,370
I know I have to say that right

322
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,350
but when your design thing to try to

323
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,240
remember that that they're not machines

324
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,250
they're humans sometimes we can forget

325
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,490
so we want to empower them and by that I

326
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,320
mean give them tools give them processes

327
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,850
that actually work and then give them

328
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,200
the knowledge that they need to do their

329
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,840
job and that also means don't give them

330
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,430
a crap ton of extra knowledge they do

331
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,400
not need to do their job so don't flood

332
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,350
them so for instance don't send them a

333
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,210
link to NIST and tell them to read it

334
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,140
unless they have sleeping problems equal

335
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,850
opportunity so I'm a firm believer that

336
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,560
security should be available for

337
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,780
everyone in your word and not just you

338
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,390
know the senior people I worked at this

339
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,130
one place where the senior devs told me

340
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,750
that all of the devs underneath them

341
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,820
were too stupid to learn security and

342
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,860
then I realized I was definitely talking

343
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,340
to the wrong people and also I feel pity

344
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,290
for someone that has to work for someone

345
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,360
that thinks that way about them that is

346
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
tragedy but anyway we need

347
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,270
accountability so this means if your

348
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,130
team makes a mistake it's really

349
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,370
important that you admit it and you tell

350
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,830
the devs about it if appropriate

351
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,240
I mean if it's an incident it has

352
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,470
nothing to do with them you should not

353
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,440
tell them but whenever possible try to

354
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,420
hold your own team accountable

355
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,610
like if you're providing it like if

356
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,110
you're creating a huge bottleneck on a

357
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,140
project acknowledge it talk about ways

358
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,060
that you can fix it and maybe that made

359
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,070
you need to hire someone it could be a

360
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,100
lot of different things but I know

361
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,930
personally that I have a bit of

362
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,850
perfectionism issues sometimes it's

363
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,250
really hard for me to admit mistakes but

364
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,290
I can tell you that when you do when you

365
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,330
admit you're vulnerable when you admit

366
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,090
there's a problem or an error that that

367
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,160
is when you build the absolute most

368
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,650
amount of trust with another person and

369
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,740
that is when they know that they can

370
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,360
look like that you're allowing them to

371
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,800
hold you accountable you've told them

372
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,330
what the problem is and like together

373
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,740
you make a plan to fix it and then you

374
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,690
go execute that plan if something

375
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,250
happens in the future and that person

376
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,960
steps out of line you can definitely

377
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,520
exert the same requirement of them and

378
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,470
lastly it's important to make your stuff

379
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,200
accessible a lot of us don't realize how

380
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,240
many people where we work are not fully

381
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,640
abled so this could just mean you know

382
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,829
if if someone needs to work from home

383
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:27,430
when they do their training or providing

384
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,019
audiobooks if they're available versus

385
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:32,839
just written books or just ebooks right

386
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,350
so ask people what they need make this

387
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,620
this little thing will mean the world to

388
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,810
some of your employees not going to go

389
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,399
on and on about it but accessibility is

390
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,950
a real thing and that doesn't just mean

391
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,390
your customers all right empathy it

392
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,760
turns out that soft skills are life

393
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,899
skills there are life skills and just

394
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:59,180
some people did everybody fella ping

395
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,680
them because for some reason they

396
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,029
thought that was okay

397
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,149
you will be an awful application

398
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,130
security professional if you have no

399
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,850
empathy I okay so I'm trying to stay on

400
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,100
track for my exactly fifty five minutes

401
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,550
but I will just tell one story I worked

402
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,010
somewhere once and the first couple

403
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,640
weeks I saw two of my team members who

404
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,040
were who'd been there a lot longer than

405
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,300
me who I'd already like my spidey senses

406
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,720
we're just like oh about both of them

407
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,279
but when I saw this I just I melted down

408
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,480
so they were both making faces at each

409
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,180
other and they're both like and then

410
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,970
laughing at each other and I I'm

411
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,339
watching them and it looks like my like

412
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,500
four-year-olds on a playground like what

413
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,910
are they doing and they're making these

414
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,300
weird faces at each other and I come up

415
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,399
and like brand-new employee trying

416
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,630
really hard to be friendly and I'm like

417
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,110
hey guys what are you doing and they

418
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,209
told me with no shame at all they're

419
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:07,369
proud of themselves were practicing

420
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,679
faces to make at software developers and

421
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,230
meetings when they ask stupid questions

422
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,660
so they know how stupid they are and

423
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,360
they know not to ask again

424
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,270
they just had a meeting with a bunch of

425
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,880
devs and whenever the devs had asked

426
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,439
them something which I'm sure they just

427
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,179
didn't know the answer to they had made

428
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,340
a condescending face like that at them

429
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,660
and then refused to answer their

430
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,990
question and so I told my boss and my

431
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,020
boss was like well you know boys will be

432
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,360
blazing but like all these excuses for

433
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,420
them and I told her I couldn't go to a

434
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,450
meeting with them and submit a dev to

435
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,220
that and that I was totally disgusted

436
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,830
and repulsed and I just like I can't

437
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,360
work with them yeah so I didn't last

438
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,419
there very long but anyway stories okay

439
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,500
continue talk Tanya okay idols so I

440
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,000
believe that we have an obsession with

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,960
hackers I believe that like we seem to

442
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,210
think that red team is more important

443
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,090
than the other teams and that we appear

444
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,460
to be glorifying it and sometimes people

445
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,770
tell me that that's not true

446
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,410
but do we have this many different

447
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,940
movies about accountants and that we

448
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,070
don't do we have TV shows that a kid

449
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,419
it's like oh my god you're just got to

450
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,049
get this tax reporting now no but we

451
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,880
have a complete obsession with red team

452
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,480
and I truly believe that it's harming

453
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,990
our industry when I see like mr. robot

454
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,410
like yes that's a fun piece of

455
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,360
television entertainment I liked

456
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,660
watching it I watched some of it I liked

457
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,860
what I watched most of it but but I

458
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,270
don't want anyone to think I'm like that

459
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,049
guy I don't want people to think that

460
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:56,640
that's what I do for a living and if

461
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,200
that had been my introduction to

462
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,700
security I'm not sure I would have

463
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,450
drained our field right like I feel that

464
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,520
that is like rappelling away lots of

465
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,500
people who maybe are like me who are a

466
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,900
little bit more like the wasp Care Bear

467
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,640
of security that wants to come and help

468
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,120
the devs right and all parts all the

469
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,299
jobs in security are important not just

470
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,990
Red Team I'm also seeing where companies

471
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,570
just like pentest the crap out of their

472
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,460
apps and they don't do anything else for

473
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,559
security and I'm just like what are you

474
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,690
thinking like but they don't know they

475
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,169
don't know that that

476
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:34,480
kissing is one part under the entire app

477
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,220
second Brella and there's so many

478
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,289
different activities you can do and this

479
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,119
is because we've glorified pen testing

480
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,210
testing super important but it is not

481
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,940
the only thing that is important and

482
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,220
this it just like frustrates the pants

483
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,619
off of me even though I was a pen tester

484
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,419
and they started as a pen tester because

485
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:54,519
it's the only it's the only job that I

486
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,190
thought I had so like I am really

487
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,070
worried about this as it as an O so this

488
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,779
should say cyber mentoring Monday so

489
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:03,549
pretend assess cyber mentoring Monday

490
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:05,289
because we've changed our hashtags so

491
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,659
every Monday I do this thing and a bunch

492
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:10,960
of us participate now and we use this

493
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,119
hashtag cyber mentoring Monday to help

494
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,700
people find professional mentors and get

495
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,340
advice on how to enter our field well

496
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,919
when I first started it people the first

497
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,200
six months just every single week it was

498
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,909
just I want to be a pen tester I want to

499
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:26,889
be a pen tester I want to be a pen

500
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,980
tester but slowly after sharing just

501
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,230
tons of stuff of an app SEC instant

502
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,230
response forensics like all the

503
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,989
different types of jobs and I also you

504
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,399
know I wrote some articles and stuff to

505
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,019
to show people like there's this entire

506
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,320
umbrella under InfoSec and another

507
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,080
smaller and Brenda umbrella under accent

508
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,779
I've so many cool jobs and now people

509
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:51,489
are asking for all sorts of things and I

510
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:53,169
think that's really really wonderful to

511
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,039
see this shift but if people only want

512
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,220
one job that's problematic too okay so

513
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,529
now I'm gonna get kind of technical on

514
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,749
you and I'm assuming that you're gonna

515
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:11,649
love it because I do so this is an image

516
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,989
that someone I used to work with Ashley

517
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:17,379
Nomura made for me and I used to joke

518
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:18,879
that when I didn't know what to do I

519
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,039
would tweet at oh a spand shining the

520
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,850
bat symbol into the into the internet

521
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,859
and then the wasp community would come

522
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,049
and help me with my abstract problems

523
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:30,629
and so she made this beautiful

524
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:33,070
illustration she's a very talented

525
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,200
artist and she's open sourced this image

526
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,850
so if any of you want to put your own

527
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,669
stickers you can but let's talk about

528
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:42,609
what the purple team does so we're going

529
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:45,389
to talk about specific strategies

530
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,579
for modern apps now and this is going to

531
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:50,039
be like 98% of the rest of the talk so

532
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,219
please be ready and all these slides are

533
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:55,289
available after and they're recording it

534
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:57,509
so don't freak out if you're like my

535
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:58,919
brain melted after at the first five

536
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,629
minutes it's okay minded to okay so

537
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:06,809
let's start with zero trust what we used

538
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:09,599
to do back in the day is we would have

539
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,879
the perimeter protected so we had an

540
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:15,809
amazing wall firewall and everything

541
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,789
inside we trusted and everything outside

542
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:20,129
was bad and we would just work really

543
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:22,409
hard on protecting the perimeter well

544
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,929
what happened is is if we had insider

545
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,089
threats they had access to everything

546
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:28,799
and that was a disaster

547
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,049
if someone managed to get in past the

548
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,599
firewall and they were malicious and

549
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,619
access to everything disaster also just

550
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:40,559
if there's an accident again

551
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,379
everything's open potential disaster and

552
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,769
so a bunch of different people came up

553
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:49,169
with the idea of zero trust and then I

554
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,589
believe Google popularized it and it's

555
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,599
brilliant the idea is is that you only

556
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:57,690
open to by default you trust no one and

557
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,179
then you only open up to the thing that

558
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,919
needs it so for instance close every

559
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,809
single port except for the one that you

560
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:07,409
need and if you can close that 98% of

561
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:08,909
the time and just open it when you use

562
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,459
it right or if you have a database and

563
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:13,349
it needs to talk to an app then only the

564
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,539
service account for that app can talk to

565
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,269
it and nothing else can ever talk to it

566
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:21,269
except the administrator and again only

567
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,159
the administrator has access not

568
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,450
everyone on the team so zero trust in

569
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,369
our applications between our

570
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:31,769
applications between our app and our API

571
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:34,499
and our API so other API is between

572
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:36,359
server lists all of those things zero

573
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,690
trust authenticate and authorize every

574
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,450
single time the way you configure things

575
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,309
the way you design your network

576
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:46,259
everything should be zero trust and hand

577
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,959
in hand with that similar but not the

578
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:52,169
same is assumed breach so this is when

579
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,269
you react to things and when you design

580
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,999
things assume a breach has happened and

581
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:58,970
then look at your design again

582
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,110
if a thing happens let's say um let's

583
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,030
say you have a coordinated or a

584
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,340
responsible disclosure program or you

585
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,470
have a bounty above bounty program

586
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,780
someone reports a bug it's big and scary

587
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,010
you should assume breach and involve

588
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,830
your incident response team tell them we

589
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,059
want you to investigate and see if

590
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,530
something happened this would be

591
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,470
assuming reach but the key here is just

592
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,919
we can't trust any more pressing really

593
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,620
burn best many many times and so zero

594
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,419
trust and only trusting the things you

595
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,500
absolutely need to is is it malicious

596
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,690
actors where it's nice it's the best

597
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,080
okay so Sir Willis and logic acts so

598
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,020
logic app is a trigger it's true or its

599
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,669
false and by that I mean like let's say

600
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:53,450
a user tries to log in in a hundred

601
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,789
times in under a minute and that sets

602
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:57,890
off a trigger that would be a logic app

603
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,590
it would be a setting and then when the

604
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,230
logic app runs the only thing it does

605
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,159
usually is called a serverless app and a

606
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:09,890
server this app let's let's step back a

607
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,900
bit so remember back in the day we used

608
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,679
to have big huge servers bare metal

609
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,650
we called it put it in big racks we gave

610
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,260
it cute names and we you would have one

611
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,250
app on one server or like 20 apps on one

612
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,620
server and then they'd all be in each

613
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,070
other space and problematic etc so then

614
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,320
we created virtual machines and when we

615
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,630
broke that up so you could run several

616
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,789
different machines in a hypervisor all

617
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:40,610
on the same physical server then we went

618
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,679
to the cloud where a server space kind

619
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,539
of moved all around right and it became

620
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:47,659
a bit more it is managed for us and we

621
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:48,950
couldn't see what's going on in the

622
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,210
background but we can have VMs

623
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,330
everywhere then from virtual machines we

624
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,280
went into containers and container is

625
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,440
just a subset of the operating system

626
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,409
that you need to run your app or your

627
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:03,350
API or your micro service or whatever it

628
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,169
is that you're doing so previously let's

629
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:07,909
say a virtual machine might have two

630
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:10,399
gigs of memory to run Windows Server and

631
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,200
then

632
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,809
two gigs of hard drive space to save all

633
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:16,240
that stuff from the operating system you

634
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,980
can have a maker service run on the

635
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,840
little container and it could have three

636
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,940
Meg's of RAM and four Meg's of hard

637
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,659
drive space and serverless at sorry um

638
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:30,850
and so a server less app is a container

639
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,309
that that just runs when you need it so

640
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:38,559
um it doesn't sit there running all the

641
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,110
time like a regular container would or a

642
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,840
virtual machine or a server it just

643
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,679
turns on the container explodes it runs

644
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,909
whatever it's supposed to do and then it

645
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,980
self-destructs and releases all of the

646
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,750
resources so that means you could pay

647
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,330
maybe for nine minutes a month instead

648
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,250
of every single minute and the whole

649
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,230
month that can save you money and

650
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,899
greatly reduce your attack surface okay

651
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:04,029
so now that we're experts and I elected

652
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:06,010
this long rant about containers and

653
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,820
serverless how should we how should we

654
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,490
secure them well one don't stop doing

655
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,110
all the regular app check you should do

656
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,090
don't forget because we're doing a new

657
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,220
tech this will be the main advice for

658
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,740
every single item don't forget all the

659
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,960
things you already know so for this we

660
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,600
would log and monitor you still wanna

661
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,779
know what's up right but wait wait no we

662
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:30,970
want to still write secure code we want

663
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,220
to still validate our inputs we still

664
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,220
want to encrypt our data in transit and

665
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,720
at Resik we still want to do all that

666
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,500
stuff but we also want to employ api

667
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,470
gateways as a security buffer we want to

668
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,720
not only log and monitor the functions

669
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,250
but we should give that information to

670
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,590
the sim because your sock needs to know

671
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,860
what's going on um we want to manage our

672
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,529
secrets in a secret store so secret

673
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,600
store is like a passer manager for

674
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,779
computers so computers talk to secret

675
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:02,139
stores

676
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,539
humans talk to password managers and the

677
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:07,000
idea is you programmatically manage all

678
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,679
your secrets so human beings never have

679
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,419
them which means less mistakes and less

680
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:13,210
leaks and we want to deploy our

681
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,519
functions with minimal granularity and

682
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,799
by that I mean a server this app should

683
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,169
do one thing if it needs to do 20 things

684
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:22,179
maybe you need 20 different service

685
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:22,750
hacks or

686
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,300
10 but don't have a service hat that

687
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,210
says literally everything and you should

688
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,340
have isolated perimeters and by that I

689
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,410
mean if you have a server let's at and

690
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,690
it calls another serverless app it

691
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,380
should not trust each other it should

692
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,230
not use you know connect to the you know

693
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,970
this one calls this one and it's like oh

694
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm sure it's fine no you still need to

695
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,530
authenticate and authorize every single

696
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,610
time next third-party component library

697
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,240
management also known in my opinion as

698
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,330
software supply chain security right now

699
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,120
lots of apps have lots of code in it you

700
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,170
did not right so your framework a new

701
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:11,400
get package a cool JavaScript plug-in

702
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,170
anything like this a thing that manages

703
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,600
your images for you and compresses them

704
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,490
and then removes the geo tracking

705
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,100
information in it all of that is coding

706
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,720
you didn't write but you're still

707
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,030
accepting the risk a lot of people will

708
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,100
call this open source security

709
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,890
however dotnet framework is proprietary

710
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,220
and I use it and I still care if it's

711
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,890
secure or not and like it's still humans

712
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,220
which sometimes make mistakes creating

713
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,010
it and is it a kickass like framework

714
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,760
yes

715
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,790
but are there bugs and older versions

716
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,380
absolutely and I want to know and so

717
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,970
it's not just open source it doesn't

718
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,800
matter all the components that you add

719
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,310
need to be secure and so I suggest using

720
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,700
a suffer composition analysis tool so

721
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,130
SCA for short there's a whole bunch on

722
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,450
the market and I'm not going to name a

723
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,920
whole bunch of names because this is not

724
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,780
a marketing pitch this is the lesson yo

725
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,670
and unless you could just search it and

726
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,070
you'll find lots um but the point is is

727
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:14,020
that you want it to check ideally you

728
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,610
would do two different checks you

729
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,410
wouldn't just do one assuming you can

730
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,210
afford it but just doing one will be a

731
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:23,800
huge huge benefit to you also you should

732
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,780
scan your repository and you should scan

733
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,630
in your build pipelines the reason for

734
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,030
this is one you might have all this

735
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,980
legacy stuff that you hardly ever build

736
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,660
or that you don't put through a pipeline

737
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,700
and you just like publish ones

738
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,230
you still want to know if those

739
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,870
components are secure and then on top of

740
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,880
that having it in your pipeline could

741
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,860
stop you from accidentally adding

742
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,700
something and it has big problems and it

743
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,290
can break the build and block you before

744
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,910
that ever gets out onto the Internet

745
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:55,630
it's really important next online

746
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,290
storage online storage so basically your

747
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,380
data is the crown jewels of where you

748
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,120
work so the most important thing of

749
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,790
every single company is your employees

750
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,640
and the second most important thing is

751
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,910
your data and since we're not doing

752
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,430
physical security we're doing IT

753
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,890
security we're going to talk about your

754
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,090
data and so I'm a firm believer that we

755
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,190
should lock everything down by default

756
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,290
you should make it so you have to pry

757
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,710
all that security off with like a fork

758
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,110
and a knife so that you can accidentally

759
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,110
leak data it's so important that you

760
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,960
make the default the most secure way to

761
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,910
do whatever you want and creating a

762
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,490
template for your org and then enforcing

763
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,200
it with a policy with your cloud

764
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,650
provider is really really an ideal way

765
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,950
to accomplish this I believe that all of

766
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,420
the clouds have a thing that will alert

767
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,340
you if someone's breaking policy ie

768
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,950
peeling off the layers of security I

769
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,860
know a DES used to work for Microsoft I

770
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,900
don't work there anymore but usually

771
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,850
they all all the major clouds have all

772
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,440
the same features which is kind of

773
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,710
Awesome another thing which a lot of

774
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,710
people a lot of people tell me like oh

775
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,600
that's not very sexy yeah yeah

776
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,070
classifying your data isn't like a

777
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,740
really fun exciting task however you

778
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,180
know what's awesome when I'm in an

779
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,460
incident and I find out that the data is

780
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,980
Oh totally unclassified that's public

781
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,800
knowledge no problem no need for me to

782
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,530
grow a lot of new gray hairs right but

783
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,600
if I'm in an incident and I find it okay

784
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,640
so this information is actually secret

785
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,680
and from government information it

786
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,760
should never have been there in the

787
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,560
first place somehow it's been leaked we

788
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,990
need to respond appropriately that helps

789
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,150
me set expectations and also know

790
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,030
exactly what parts of my Incident

791
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,190
Response process that I should enact

792
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,169
having a classification of your data

793
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,720
also means the computers can know how to

794
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,289
treat it

795
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:54,879
it means the developers know how to

796
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:56,740
treat it we should be classifying our

797
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,470
data and I know it's not exciting but it

798
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,360
sometimes we have to do boring stuff so

799
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,419
we can do the cool stuff I am a firm

800
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:07,840
believer that humans shouldn't be

801
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,759
accessing your online storage in your

802
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:15,309
cloud identity or sorry and like

803
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:18,340
computers accounts service accounts

804
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,169
should be accessing it not human account

805
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:23,590
so Tania's account should not be acting

806
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,840
on behalf of an app and then going into

807
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,299
your online storage that app should have

808
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,919
its own service account and that should

809
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,190
access it and we should have monitoring

810
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,529
of all of our online stores so

811
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:38,259
monitoring file integrity monitoring

812
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:41,769
port sniffing and we want to have alert

813
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,409
so for instance if someone copies all

814
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:46,809
the stuff out of your online storage

815
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:49,690
that should be an alert and then let's

816
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:53,200
say then they go and they delete it that

817
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,809
should probably be a bigger alert and

818
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,429
then if they go to delete the backup

819
00:33:57,429 --> 00:33:59,200
that should definitely trigger an

820
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,399
incident in Asia block Lim yes and I

821
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,169
already discussed service accounts so

822
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,549
now let's talk about containers and

823
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,440
orchestration so we're already experts

824
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,060
in containers from that blue slide

825
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,940
through slides ago right so container is

826
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,119
a subset of a virtual machine it's a

827
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,369
subset of an operating system it's just

828
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:20,440
the parts that you need to run the thing

829
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,000
that you're going to do and they're much

830
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,310
much smaller you can have a whole bunch

831
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,980
of them all on the same server many many

832
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,280
many and if you want to manage all of

833
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,069
them as a whole you would do

834
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:38,349
orchestration so cuber Nettie's is the

835
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:40,989
biggest product and basically the thing

836
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,489
it seems to be the standard and

837
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,929
dominating the industry and that's why

838
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:46,179
I'm naming them but basically the idea

839
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,319
is that if you want to start stop

840
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:52,119
destroy edit like all the things you

841
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,409
would do to manage all of your

842
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,699
containers you would do it via

843
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,550
orchestration then give an orchestra and

844
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,859
the director directing everything that

845
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,630
would be your orchestration system and

846
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,279
all of the musicians and the orchestra

847
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:05,170
will be your containers that really

848
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,400
helps me personally

849
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,299
visualize it okay so don't forget

850
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:11,289
yourselves

851
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,720
you should still design your containers

852
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,559
and everything else seem we would if

853
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,960
you're doing a regular virtual machine

854
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,000
you would still heard in it right you

855
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,299
would still apply zero trust you do all

856
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:26,740
the things that you already know that

857
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,190
you should do right so don't treat them

858
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,289
don't don't let them off the hook but

859
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:34,390
there's more so they're slightly more so

860
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,890
there's new types of configurations

861
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,809
you're gonna have to learn and there's

862
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:40,089
new tools for scanning containers versus

863
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:42,309
virtual machines so you're gonna have to

864
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,140
learn those too

865
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,369
there's new types of vulnerabilities to

866
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,559
watch out for just like people when I

867
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,180
escape virtual machines they want to

868
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,160
escape containers you need to watch out

869
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,220
for that this is the one that's like

870
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,410
specifically new you really need to make

871
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,690
sure that you're very careful about who

872
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,690
is able to edit or create containers

873
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,099
that is kind of like the keys to your

874
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:04,509
kingdom you definitely want to have

875
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:06,490
multi-factor authentication on those who

876
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,009
want to monitor and have a short list of

877
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:11,289
who gets to do that that is a very very

878
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:13,990
important thing and basically do all the

879
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,109
same thing you used to do scan you know

880
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:19,900
harden your configurations either patch

881
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,690
or replace with updated versions like

882
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,720
make sure that you are applying all of

883
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,269
the updates and by applying I mean like

884
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,579
getting a new version of that thing also

885
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:33,339
don't just fish random containers off of

886
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:36,609
docker hub just like cuz it's on docker

887
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:37,630
hub doesn't mean there's necessarily

888
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,029
super secure you should definitely make

889
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:41,920
sure if you're the security team that

890
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,170
you are providing a place where either

891
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,839
there are approved containers or

892
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:48,369
containers that you've tested or

893
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,289
templates that you've created for your

894
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:52,329
dev team and your ops team you should

895
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:53,950
not be allowing them to just go off and

896
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,809
be like wild crazy shopping trip on

897
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:57,579
docker hub because although there's also

898
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:59,289
closings out there you just don't do

899
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:02,259
that okay next api's and micro services

900
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:06,420
so an API is a web app with no front end

901
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,869
that's it

902
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:10,599
it has all the backend stuff it just has

903
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,750
no friend so you can talk to it from a

904
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,560
front-end

905
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,810
you can talk to it from a mobile app if

906
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,210
you're a hacker you can talk to it from

907
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,860
wherever you want I keep you get an app

908
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,300
like postman and then you could just

909
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,950
call api's and talk to them if they're

910
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,700
not predictive properly no damn it but

911
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,580
with permission and then micro services

912
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,830
are api's that are itty-bitty teeny tiny

913
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,700
that just do one thing so let's say you

914
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,840
know it's a delivery site and they want

915
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,670
to look up your address so they ask for

916
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,130
your postal code you put in the postal

917
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,780
code it goes to the micro servers it

918
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,400
comes back with the rest of the address

919
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,180
for you boom micro service so API is no

920
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,510
front-end you still need to do all the

921
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,420
same step so you still need to do input

922
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,100
validation you still need to authorize

923
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,570
people to use your app um although

924
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,250
there's no front end so you don't need

925
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,710
to do a put encoding you still need to

926
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,270
do all the other things that don't

927
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,680
involve the front end and it's really

928
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,390
really really important that you don't

929
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,200
forget yourself

930
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,300
I call it forgetting yourself because

931
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,540
that's what it feels like to me so all

932
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,000
the regular app sex stuff still needs to

933
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,260
happen but on top of that Service mash

934
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,170
service mash is a cool using the a bunch

935
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,480
of smart people made all the clouds have

936
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,730
their own which are proprietary just for

937
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,170
their cloud and then there's a bunch

938
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,340
that are actually um was the word that

939
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,410
are agnostic and can be used on any

940
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,540
cloud and the idea is it's an

941
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,850
infrastructure layer that overlays all

942
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:49,150
your API so maker services and it you

943
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,740
don't have to change your code and it

944
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,720
just encrypt everything and manages

945
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,460
things and secures them as they're

946
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,010
happening so it will not fix your code

947
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,430
for you but it will protect your service

948
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:03,280
another thing is creating standardized

949
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,280
template I have worked at places and

950
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,470
then testing where everyone is making

951
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,680
their own if he is and having them

952
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,870
vehicle different ways and that makes it

953
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,760
really hard to test and that makes it

954
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,500
really hard to make sure that people are

955
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,030
doing the right things so there should

956
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,400
be standardization and whenever possible

957
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,440
templating and then you can make sure

958
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,840
the template is secure and if everyone

959
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,060
builds off of that you start from a more

960
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,250
secure place

961
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,620
I'm a big fan of linting so wenting is

962
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,970
basically it is the grammar police for

963
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,420
your code so no poetic license I know

964
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,310
like lots of programming languages for

965
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,660
instance you don't have to declare the

966
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,490
variable type it'll just guess

967
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,210
not with linting we don't want to leave

968
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,300
anything up to chance we want to be

969
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,430
explicit with everything and setting the

970
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,810
grammar police and by that I mean

971
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,690
linting on your code you'll have higher

972
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,290
quality code that will be more secure we

973
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,940
should also do throttling and resource

974
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,590
quotas for throttling is slowing things

975
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,140
down as people ask for more and resource

976
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,000
Coda's means you hit a number and they

977
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,340
just stop so let's say someone's trying

978
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,030
to log in and a human being will like

979
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,680
definitely screw up their password two

980
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,740
three four even five times in a row but

981
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,580
they can't answer it ten times at one

982
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,240
second that is a machine but they can

983
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,900
answer it ten times in a minute so you

984
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,170
need to throttle and slow that down for

985
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,060
each consecutive one so after the first

986
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,060
five maybe make it wait like one second

987
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,970
or a half second and then slow so so

988
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,270
slow and then a human being of course

989
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,980
isn't there's no human being that I know

990
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,160
that is so stubborn that would try to

991
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,300
log in 100 times in an hour

992
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,850
and so you should cut them off probably

993
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,410
cut them off before that because it's an

994
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,300
automated machine accessing your stuff

995
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,210
so if you pair throttling and quotas

996
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,950
together you will have better results

997
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,440
and you have to be careful I know

998
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,420
because you don't want to lock out real

999
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,120
customers you need to authenticate and

1000
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,700
then authorize we need to know who we

1001
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,320
are talking to and then tell them what

1002
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,430
they're allowed to go do in our systems

1003
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,410
this goes for everything that went for

1004
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,610
everything and this goes for everything

1005
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,010
don't give for both error messages if

1006
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,920
someone gives you a malformed request to

1007
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,570
call your API don't tell them what they

1008
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,960
did wrong this me as a pen tester am i

1009
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,510
great thanks for helping me craft a

1010
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,290
better attack just say malformed request

1011
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,760
that's it

1012
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,250
computers aren't making typos right so

1013
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,690
if there's an out firm request there's a

1014
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,090
reason for it I mean the last one on

1015
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,010
this is and again this applies to all

1016
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:55,000
web apps if there are HTTP methods or

1017
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,250
verbs as they're sometimes called that

1018
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,710
you're not using block all of them block

1019
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,830
all of them so if you're using trace but

1020
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,800
not head book head most people use get

1021
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,930
and post for everything but if you're

1022
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,170
not using delete block it especially OS

1023
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:16,300
block FTP okay next modern tooling so

1024
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,110
I'm going to tell you about the

1025
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,700
different types of modern tools that

1026
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,330
exist just the types of tools not the

1027
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,240
vendors so I asked interactive

1028
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,700
application security testing so it's a

1029
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,100
little bit like DAST because your app is

1030
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,770
running and it's moving dynamically

1031
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,780
however interactive application security

1032
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,260
testing tests as you're using an app so

1033
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,060
only test the parts of the app that are

1034
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,770
actually called which is pretty

1035
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,990
interesting it's supposed to save time

1036
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,470
and be fast rasp so this should say F

1037
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,750
typo so this should say runtime

1038
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,580
application security testing not real

1039
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,760
time although it does work very quickly

1040
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,580
and this is as a next-generation laugh

1041
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,430
or web app firewall the idea of a rasp

1042
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,580
is that it's like a stub within your

1043
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,520
application and then it is more specific

1044
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,470
for each one of your inputs as opposed

1045
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,480
to a laugh first generation web

1046
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,670
application firewall where it just has a

1047
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,920
diet amount of regular expressions and

1048
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,630
every single request to your app has to

1049
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,090
go through that a rasp is more specific

1050
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,770
and broken down into smaller pieces

1051
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:25,110
there's also usually a I n ml which are

1052
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,940
obviously amazing marketing buzzwords

1053
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,460
but having machine learning is part of

1054
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,580
your your protection is probably awesome

1055
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:37,330
I've seen and heard good things file

1056
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,340
integrity monitoring is always paired

1057
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,140
with application whitelisting for best

1058
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,360
results so if I'm integrity monitoring

1059
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,880
is making sure that none of your system

1060
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,670
files get renamed or changed an

1061
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,320
application whitelisting means only

1062
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,940
things that are on this wait list this

1063
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:57,060
approved lists are allowed to run and so

1064
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,380
when malware tries to get onto your

1065
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,670
servers the first thing it does is it

1066
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,120
tries to boot up and then the it'll look

1067
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,010
at the accepted list it'll be like

1068
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,990
you're not on there no it won't be

1069
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,670
allowed to start so the second thing

1070
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,290
that word does it's like I know I'll do

1071
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,690
I'll rename myself to a system file and

1072
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,510
overwrite it then I can run ant file

1073
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,860
integrity monitoring you want to love

1074
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,860
that so although it is a lot of work to

1075
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,430
implement this properly it's just such a

1076
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,040
huge win because now we're just stopped

1077
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,070
in his tracks cloud made of controls so

1078
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,720
these are security tools built

1079
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,730
specifically for the clouds so some of

1080
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:38,220
them are like cloud specific or provider

1081
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,050
or vendor specific and some of them are

1082
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,640
agnostic and work across many different

1083
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,880
clouds and you should totally check them

1084
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,370
out if you are paying for cloud services

1085
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,960
there's probably a whole bunch of free

1086
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,520
security tools that they are providing

1087
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,340
and you should use them because you're

1088
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,980
paying for that and also they're

1089
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,500
probably pretty good because otherwise

1090
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,480
the cloud providers wouldn't wouldn't

1091
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,110
have them adding security tools to your

1092
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,420
DevOps pipeline so I wanted to word this

1093
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,850
differently so these are access tools

1094
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,670
that have been changed or developed

1095
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,600
specifically to run in pipelines so a

1096
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,300
lot of the older tools that are

1097
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,820
standards that are really amazing

1098
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,790
don't run well in pipelines so either

1099
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,520
they need to be adjusted or there's all

1100
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,470
sorts of really cool exciting new tools

1101
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,060
coming out some of which I can't tell

1102
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,830
you about because I'm talking to all

1103
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:32,880
these startups and they're telling me

1104
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,630
they're amazing ideas but yeah tool

1105
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,520
there's like all these cool tools coming

1106
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,940
out that are made rape for pipelines um

1107
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,470
if you're using the cloud you can make

1108
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,570
customized alerts and you can automate

1109
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,730
responses so if you see something a lot

1110
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,080
you can create an automated response

1111
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,680
which is really cool and I don't know

1112
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,030
what to call it except application

1113
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,950
inventory tools for those that follow me

1114
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,080
last year I started a company that did

1115
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,630
inventory like we made a tool that did

1116
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,460
that and our company didn't work out and

1117
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,930
that's fine but there's all these other

1118
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,330
companies that like did not fall apart

1119
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,950
there are creating really cool tools

1120
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,859
that can

1121
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:10,960
helped you find all of your apps or all

1122
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,569
of your public facing assets which is so

1123
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:14,980
important because you have so much stuff

1124
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,180
on the internet that you don't know

1125
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,670
about but they can still be attacked and

1126
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,650
understanding your complete attack

1127
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,640
surface is so so important now for

1128
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,970
tactics moderate tactics so adding tools

1129
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:30,220
to your pipeline and not just doing them

1130
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,200
outside your pipeline is a new tactic

1131
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,829
I'm taking unit tests duplicating them

1132
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:38,079
and then adding malicious payloads and

1133
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,239
making sure that your application fails

1134
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,339
gracefully this is a new tactic I've

1135
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:44,789
seen which is really cool

1136
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:47,079
breaking your security activities into

1137
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:48,549
smaller pieces so like doing a security

1138
00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:53,140
sprint for instance um taking your

1139
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,210
penetration test results and then

1140
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,739
turning them into unit tests to make

1141
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:58,660
sure that those problems don't happen

1142
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,940
again and also you know creating unit

1143
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,880
tests if appropriate and having them in

1144
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,980
your other apps because if they find

1145
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,390
something really interesting in your pen

1146
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,279
test those programmers probably made

1147
00:47:09,279 --> 00:47:10,930
more than one app for you and they made

1148
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,640
it may have made that same mistake

1149
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,559
Ellsberg tuning tools for automation and

1150
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:19,599
efficiency I don't mean that so comes

1151
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,420
sending but tools are way more flexible

1152
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,829
than they used to be and this is really

1153
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:26,410
cool and spending the time to you know

1154
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,720
surprise false positives etc so they

1155
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,279
work even better and better it's

1156
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:33,880
definitely worth your time automated

1157
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,700
repository scanning if your code is just

1158
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,400
sitting there so why not just have scans

1159
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,339
run on all the time right if you already

1160
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:45,249
bought a tool you should do it um so the

1161
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:47,739
next thing is dev stack ops this is my

1162
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,980
favorite topic um this is the idea of

1163
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,749
performing app sack in a DevOps

1164
00:47:52,749 --> 00:47:55,259
environment um

1165
00:47:55,259 --> 00:47:58,210
includes but is not limited to adding

1166
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,329
security tooling to your pipeline

1167
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:04,210
ensuring a very fast feedback about

1168
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,670
security so fixing bugs earlier pushing

1169
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:09,249
left making every single moment a

1170
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:10,869
teaching moment even the ones where we

1171
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:13,029
have egg on our face just hard for me

1172
00:48:13,029 --> 00:48:16,839
personally but there's so much value in

1173
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:20,730
it and it's just us weaving security

1174
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,260
throughout there

1175
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,510
and making sure what we're doing is

1176
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:29,200
efficient oh and there's like a link at

1177
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,910
the bottom to a talk I did about this

1178
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,980
because I have like several talks on

1179
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,090
this topic um so cloud of security Tonya

1180
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,710
you can't just talk about cloud security

1181
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:42,430
in every talk that's not allowed um but

1182
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,430
some apps live in the cloud and I truly

1183
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,680
believe that if you if you are an

1184
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,540
application security professional and

1185
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,070
you work in a company that is using

1186
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,980
cloud that you need to learn some cloud

1187
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,700
security because if you make a super

1188
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,350
secure app and someone still hacks the

1189
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,810
crap out of it it still as a giant

1190
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,670
native breach there's still a go over

1191
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,310
your face and I think that if your

1192
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,510
company is going to move to the cloud

1193
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,100
you need to learn some cloud scary date

1194
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,500
I have lots of other information about

1195
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,510
that so we'll just leave that for now

1196
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,420
but the stress is that I feel you need

1197
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,060
to even if you're not cloud security

1198
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:24,910
expert okay so here are modern app your

1199
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,410
here are the things that the purple team

1200
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,970
does actually we'll put it like that

1201
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:31,660
okay so now let's talk about automating

1202
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,910
boring stuff and then continuous

1203
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:37,330
learning so I learned a code so I

1204
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,710
wouldn't have to do things more than

1205
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,950
twice and the reason why we oughta may

1206
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,720
is to avoid something called toils so my

1207
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,270
my friend Steve Boros he made this slide

1208
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,730
and is the best he's awesome if you want

1209
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,630
to learn about site reliability

1210
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,340
engineering you should policy

1211
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,600
so anything that are these things are

1212
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,510
things that we can automate see that

1213
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,790
that's Atlas pushing the boulder we

1214
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,560
don't want to do that if we want to keep

1215
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,760
our employees happy and keep them

1216
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,650
working for us if there's boring crap

1217
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,850
they do we need to stop it it so

1218
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,960
automation so this can be adding stuff

1219
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,700
to your pipeline it can be meeting a

1220
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,740
security an asynchronous security

1221
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,810
pipeline that kicks off once a week with

1222
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,120
automated tools in it it can mean doing

1223
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,310
infrastructures code and then security

1224
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,910
is code it can mean automating things

1225
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:29,350
for the devs right basically you want to

1226
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:31,780
focus on proactive instead of reactive

1227
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,660
work so that we can prevent security

1228
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,589
incidents from how

1229
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:37,769
in the first place so we can upgrade our

1230
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:40,059
defenses so that we spend less time

1231
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:42,999
cleaning up messes right so that is the

1232
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,799
purpose of automation less oil more

1233
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:47,859
triumphs and then continuous learning

1234
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:52,960
what you're doing right now so the

1235
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,069
moment we stop learning then we fall

1236
00:50:57,069 --> 00:51:00,039
behind we can give lunch and learns we

1237
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:01,809
can offer computer-based training I

1238
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,130
realize that I work for training

1239
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:05,739
companies too I seem really biased but I

1240
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:07,420
can't tell you how important it is that

1241
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,140
we keep learning because our deaf people

1242
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,279
and our office people are just gonna

1243
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:13,989
keep bringing in new tools and keep

1244
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:16,119
doing cool new stuff and either we keep

1245
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:21,039
up or we don't um you can create like a

1246
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,809
learning calendar in your block like a

1247
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:25,210
block in your calendar every single week

1248
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,910
for learning you could do job shadowing

1249
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,880
mentoring on-the-job training there's so

1250
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,039
many options like if you find something

1251
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:34,930
really big share the information with

1252
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:37,989
every team I'm a huge fan of gathering

1253
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:41,200
metrics on your at SAC programs and then

1254
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,609
designing all of your lessons around

1255
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:44,259
that so for instance finding your top

1256
00:51:44,259 --> 00:51:46,299
three vulnerabilities and then creating

1257
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:47,680
lunch and learns on those and then

1258
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,109
hopefully seeing the instances of those

1259
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:53,019
go way down build your own specific

1260
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:55,119
training for each specific team you

1261
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,650
probably hope the SIS admin's know

1262
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,210
slightly different things than the

1263
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,849
helpdesk team but it's really important

1264
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:03,729
you talk to them and so I'm gonna

1265
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:05,499
briefly tell you the time I invited I

1266
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:07,950
invented DevOps which I didn't invent

1267
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,660
someone so I spoke at RSA in the past

1268
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,969
couple years and I gave a talk about dev

1269
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:14,979
SEP ops and when my friends aren't back

1270
00:52:14,979 --> 00:52:16,930
to work in another city and she told me

1271
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,289
this person from her office had had not

1272
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:22,450
been in training so long they saw me

1273
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,119
talk and thought that I had invented

1274
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,460
DevOps

1275
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:31,150
yeah and although like that made me feel

1276
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,400
really cool that's not true and I never

1277
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,989
said it in the talk and can you imagine

1278
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:36,489
being still out to lunch that you've

1279
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:39,339
never even heard of DevOps before can

1280
00:52:39,339 --> 00:52:40,989
you imagine that so don't be that person

1281
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:44,079
in summary I'm not so cool as to build

1282
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,099
DevOps but I really love it okay so

1283
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:50,130
huijun I don't want us to think of this

1284
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,369
guy when we think of hackers this is my

1285
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:54,900
friend stuff and this is what a hacker

1286
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,539
looks like this is what a hacker looks

1287
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:00,809
like look in the mirror that's what a

1288
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:03,989
hacker looks like we need to change our

1289
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,549
perception of our industry if we want

1290
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,650
everyone to come and work here and we

1291
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:12,509
need them we need more people and I'm

1292
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:15,239
hoping that as we continue as an

1293
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:18,839
industry we can shed this angry young

1294
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,839
man hoodie basement sitting in the dark

1295
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,329
thing that we have going and instead see

1296
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:25,950
people like Stephane think she looks

1297
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,759
like a hacker because we can't do it

1298
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:32,369
unless everyone helps is right now we're

1299
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:34,979
failing and the last part of my rant is

1300
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:36,960
please be nice to developers and all of

1301
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,329
IT they are our friend and we can't do

1302
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:41,880
this without them please don't be mean

1303
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,130
to software developers because it makes

1304
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,489
