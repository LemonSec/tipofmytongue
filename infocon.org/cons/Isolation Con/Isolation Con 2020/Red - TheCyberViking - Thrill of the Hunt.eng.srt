1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:07,710
[Music]

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,599
all right

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,800
so we've got our final talk on the red

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,320
team track today

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,199
it's cyber viking presenting thrill of

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,320
the hunt

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,240
looks kind of uh like uh like a noir

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,800
kind of film sort of thing going on here

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,279
so

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,320
cyber viking is a final year

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,640
digital forensics and cyber security

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,520
student

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,399
at tu dublin uh he said he's been

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,559
breaking stuff since he was a kid

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,200
from radios to school administrator

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,120
passwords

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,480
so obviously this made you to hopefully

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,399
apply your uh hacking abilities toward

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,840
the greater good

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,440
so you talk about how

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
ocean and how gathering intelligence

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
from little bits of data can become an

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
addiction so this

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,720
sounds kind of solicit you know kind of

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
illicit and really exciting

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,159
so go ahead cyber bike hello everyone

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,600
hope everyone's having a good day

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,040
i just hopped in here now just got this

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,479
talk ready about 10 minutes before the

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,280
talk so uh

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,119
let's see how it goes anyway we're going

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,479
to hop right into it so today we're

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,000
going to talk with the trail of the hunt

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,720
or my personal addiction to intelligence

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,080
i think all people who get into this

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,000
kind of start to understand it

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,759
i think first off we have to kind of

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,439
give a straight classification because

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,400
you know like all talks about

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,600
intelligence have some sort of

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,640
classification

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
and you have to have a classification so

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
for the purpose of this presentation

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,320
this

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,640
presentation is classified as stupid and

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,520
confusing

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,159
just so everyone knows so we're going to

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,520
jump right into it and get

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
straight into this and start

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,079
understanding a lot of things about

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
intelligence anyway

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,240
so first off who am i everywhere i go

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
every talk i've ever been to

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,159
you've got people walls of certificates

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,360
walls of text walls

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
of search saying oh this is damn this is

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
who i am this is what i do that's what i

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,520
do

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,200
i always find kind of dull and boring i

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,799
never kind of like get to know the

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,038
person based off that so

62
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,239
i think it's usually better to have a

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,840
better way of doing it so my way going

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
is you just show my tinder profile it's

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,000
easier

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
so if you want to know someone in depth

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,720
you show them your tinder profiles for

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,840
example let's go through my tinder

69
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
profile

70
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,040
so for tldr i'm a final year cyber

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,560
security student i'm an ordained

72
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
minister and the reason i did that it's

73
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
like a blessed arrangement in africa

74
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,480
i'm a certified evil genius uh i hunt

75
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,520
bugs sometimes

76
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
i found a classical music metallica

77
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,440
nirvana

78
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,760
you know really classical stuff i'm a

79
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,959
whiskey aficionado

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,120
um global trace lab ctf where three

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
times running now four times technically

82
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,480
but we won't talk about that

83
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
if i find things i track people and

84
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,680
sometimes do cool stuff

85
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
you can also get me at the server viking

86
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
on twitter if you want to just talk or

87

90
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,000
there is my twitter profile and as you

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,280
ask them

98
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
so what's on this talk well we're gonna

99
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,800
have a quick introduction uh we're gonna

100
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
figure out what intelligence is because

101
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,760
i'm still trying to figure it out

102
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,440
we're gonna do the matings that people

103
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,800
don't know we're gonna have a quick look

104
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,159
at finding people uh

105
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,640
some massive fails that happen every day

106
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,239
a few examples and some advice you

107
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:22,800
should be

108
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
using one posting stuff later on

109
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,159
hopefully you're gonna learn some stuff

110
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,560
that i learned and how see how i do

111
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,159
stuff the spooky way to figure out how

112
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,359
you can learn to do stuff as well

113
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,519
so what is intelligence well

114
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,440
but a definition of intelligence is the

115
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,640
collection of information

116
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,120
of military or political value and it

117
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
breaks down to multiple categories it

118
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
can be seen here now these categories

119
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
tend to be boring just existing the most

120
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,080
so

121
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
i'm just going to show them but i think

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,599
they break off into different drone

123
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,120
categories in different ways and we'll

124
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,239
see that in this this kind of

125
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,159
presentation

126
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,360
so how is intel red teaming everybody

127
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,319
keeps asking me this

128
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,640
how is intel writing well straight up

129
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,840
intel

130
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,879
is very important when you're doing a

131
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,319
red team engagement recon's usually the

132
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,519
first phase you go to anyways you have

133
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,280
to figure out everything

134
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
so when you're looking at companies

135
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
you're looking after different things to

136
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
post online like job postings so for

137
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,720
example

138
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,238
here's a job posting a company in dublin

139
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,759
i was looking at recently

140
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,600
they have a lot of information the

141
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,280
information includes is like

142
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,919
what os are using like windows 7 windows

143
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,400
10

144
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
using data center equipment a lot of

145
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,479
people certain years of experience

146
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,600
they're looking for like certain

147
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
certifications so we understand what

148
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,840
they're doing

149
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,040
and what they're working with so

150
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
we get on the gist of what the company's

151
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,400
security and background setup is we can

152
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,758
start prepping to attack it

153
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
so you're still not convinced like a lot

154
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,680
of people got to this point they're like

155
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,759
no no intel is still not red teaming

156
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,280
i'm going to show you right now why it

157
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,800
falls into a red teaming category and

158
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,400
with an example so 2018

159
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,560
hawaiian false missile alert go look

160
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
this up it was hilarious

161
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
basically a tweet was sent uh text

162
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,000
messages tweets posts were sent out to

163
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
everyone all over

164
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,199
california area and hawaii saying there

165
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,880
was a nuclear strike happening from

166
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
north korea

167
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
it was then posted a couple of minutes

168
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,039
later this post all looked like this was

169
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,400
posted a couple minutes later that it

170
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,800
was

171
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
fake it was accidental post it didn't

172
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
actually happen

173
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
and when they went digging for it

174
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
you know we're looking you're like okay

175
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
so they had an accident they glitch

176
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,440
computer glitches always start somewhere

177
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
and you know exactly where you start do

178
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,919
start with like public post information

179
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,440
so look at publicly posted information

180
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,880
it's great like a couple weeks before

181
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
this all happened it was a post online

182
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,120
it was a

183
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
beautiful photo operation center really

184
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,160
nice photo like

185
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
i'm saying look i'm like okay cool cool

186
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,759
operation center nice it looks really

187
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,800
good

188
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,240
start looking a bit full closer i'm like

189
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
oh cool yeah okay yeah they're using

190
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,759
windows 7. cool cool using

191
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,360
the special software using google maps

192
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
okay cool hang on a second i see

193
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,400
something there

194
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,120
it's their damn password they had a

195
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,840
password for logins to log into the

196
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,400
systems and

197
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
they still do not believe or think this

198
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,759
is how they got compromised

199
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,199
or was even compromised at all

200
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,720
so okay so you get it awesome simple

201
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,520
open source intelligence but what is it

202
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
well to simply put ocean is literally

203
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,800
everything you post out there it's

204
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
intelligence that can be pulled from you

205
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
from literally anything you can find so

206
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,199
your facebook profile

207
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,840
your twitter profile your vine god

208
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
respond like port

209
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
it was a great thing i'll replace it

210
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
with tick tock now your tick tock

211
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,000
everything that's available out there

212
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
has some form of intelligence

213
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
that can be found about you that's the

214
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,199
best way to put this it's everything

215
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,840
that's online

216
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,199
everything that's available public

217
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,960
records public information newspapers

218
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
things that aren't even online and we'll

219
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
see that now

220
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,039
so when i was saying erin about

221
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,880
intelligence breaks into many categories

222
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
we're not going to talk about just them

223
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
many multiple categories of intelligence

224
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,280
we're going to break down ocean

225
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,039
i'll show you exactly how osun breaks

226
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,639
down in all these new categories i break

227
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,080
into my own term called all source

228
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,280
oceans

229
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,000
because we can break ocean down when we

230
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,360
go deeper we start looking at deeper

231
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,400
things such as

232
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240
post our posts online and pulling

233
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
information from the post

234
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,800
so for example there was a post here

235
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,639
buddy on the european commission

236
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,120
about press briefing they were having

237
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,720
now the press briefing was very corona

238
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,599
we all know this

239
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,199
and uh a lot of people were looking and

240
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,560
going hey look photos are inside they're

241
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,199
all doing hard work at this time

242
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,400
chronovirus was still like new to

243
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,160
ireland there was only two cases listed

244
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,960
in ireland

245
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
and these posts came out oh sydney's

246
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,160
policy went

247
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,840
hang on a second there's an extra dot

248
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
it turned out with three cases and it

249
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,639
wasn't actually publicized so that was

250
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,000
something i threw up on twitter and it's

251
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,039
there if anyone wants to see it you can

252
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:47,599
see it

253
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,759
and see how i pulled the images out it

254
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,639
was pretty straightforward

255
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,199
so all source oceans let's break it down

256
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
let's break down all sorts of

257
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,160
so we got human human-based intelligence

258
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,560
cool

259
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
no you twerk tweet what you're tweeting

260
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,560
what you're posting online

261
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
with geo intelligence so geogra

262
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,240
geological information it's all out

263
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
there it's public

264
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,240
google maps we've got measurements and

265
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,960
signals intel

266
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
this seismic intelligence joint research

267
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,120
center the european commission actually

268
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,319
has it up you can see all the

269
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,440
radiological stuff online

270
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,360
we got technical intelligence because

271
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,479
well to be honest every time someone

272
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,440
works at factory somewhere they're

273
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,879
posting online about this technical

274
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,080
intelligence they're finding

275
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
oh just spent all day working on this

276
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,199
new graphics card

277
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
nightmare turns out it's actually some

278
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,240
classified secret military equipment

279
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
medical medical instruments just medical

280
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,919
intel online this it's a post that

281
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,679
always posted about

282
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,440
cyber intelligence looking at darpa's

283
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,560
new equipment that's been posted on

284
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,240
reddit

285
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,760
digital network intelligence so you can

286
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,040
figure out what's around you and what's

287
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,959
connected

288
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,320
financial intelligence obviously working

289
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,360
with stock markets and seeing how to

290
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,160
fluctuate

291
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,880
information is all public and imagery

292
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,839
based intelligence

293
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,839
and i always argued this is all one form

294
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,959
of intelligence it's

295
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,839
even though it all comes out of the

296
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,200
category of ocean it's all source

297
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
awesome because you can get

298
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,839
intelligence in every factor from ocean

299
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,959
though what's the best way to learn this

300
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,160
you want to start learning it

301
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
well the best way i say is you learn by

302
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,360
doing and you learn by

303
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
learning case studies i'm watching case

304
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,480
studies this is something you can't sit

305
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,320
and read a book or watch videos all day

306
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
long you have to sit

307
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
and play around and do this to actually

308
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
learn techniques and tactics

309
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,839
as one best way i could do this and

310
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,279
excited to give you is sourcing dot

311
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:27,920
games

312
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,040
source not games is an amazing amazing

313
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,839
place to go

314
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,279
to start learning how to do ocean and

315
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,839
play around i highly recommend to anyone

316
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,200
it's great for reporters it's great for

317
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,480
anyone out there who anyone who's into

318
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,240
journalism investigation anyway

319
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,440
it's well worth playing around learning

320
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,800
so there's important facts though when

321
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,839
you're learning there's four important

322
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,800
things you need to learn

323
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,160
and know to look at when you're doing

324
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,839
this and these are the facts there's

325
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,240
four

326
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,720
main topics i can break it down to one

327
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
the little things count

328
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,240
two everything is intelligence

329
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
three everything can be connected in

330
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
some way another

331
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,959
and four who what where when and why

332
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
and how always have them questions in

333
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,800
your head and you can answer any

334
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,480
question a better person anywhere

335
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
so if you can find an answer to every

336
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,279
single one of those you have the person

337
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,279
so by nature humans are addicted to

338
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,480
knowledge

339
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,760
we're all addicted and we're addicted to

340
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
getting information ridiculous things

341
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,560
intelligence is knowledge straight up

342
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,839
intelligence is just a form of getting

343
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,720
knowledge you're just learning about

344
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,200
something

345
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
and the problem with intelligence is

346
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,440
intelligence it's literally everywhere

347
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
everything we read about is intelligent

348
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,839
some form or another

349
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,680
so by keeping that fact everyone that is

350
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,279
intelligence we have like

351
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,279
instagram posts most people look at it

352
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,640
and oh beautiful woman

353
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
painting pictures lovely pictures over a

354
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
couple of years paints amazing photos

355
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
and making pictures and

356
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,000
beautiful photos but i'm sitting here

357
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
looking i just go hang on a second

358
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,839
this is over the last couple of years

359
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,360
and the ink the paint pile hasn't

360
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
changed

361
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
like there's obviously something wrong

362
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,279
here with this one i'll give you a good

363
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,720
example of where everything falls in

364
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,680
this everything is intelligent

365
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
example the whiskey hotel there's a post

366
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
put out from the white house about the

367
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,959
coronavirus meeting

368
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,079
public postpo out there and i was

369
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,160
sitting there looking i was like oh

370
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,240
okay we got information here right we

371
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
got their names

372
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,920
oh wait hang on a second is that a live

373
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,120
feed from the cia

374
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
and the nsa and the ost is that live

375
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,839
feed where all their faces and names

376
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,279
okay the white house screwed up and it's

377
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,480
still public they haven't pulled it down

378
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
i don't know i don't already haven't

379
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,680
pulled that one down yet

380
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
so these fails happen everywhere all day

381
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
every single day

382
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
here are some bc you see kanye west put

383
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
his password on his phone

384
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
you see the ukrainian president putting

385
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,760
his password in

386
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,240
you see north korea accidentally leaking

387
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,680
their attack maps of where they're going

388
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,480
to attack

389
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,600
you see celebrities leaking their

390
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
passwords all the time you just you see

391
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
it all with newspapers everywhere

392
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
people have failed every single day when

393
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
it comes to this kind of stuff

394
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,279
and if you start looking for and learn

395
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,279
to look for it you'll see them easily

396
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,839
and it happens worldwide for example we

397
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,279
have the irish t-shock

398
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,200
leaked his driver's license while

399
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,320
talking about voting

400
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
and when he leaked his driver's license

401
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,800
his driver's license happened to have

402
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,399
his home address his date of birth it

403
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:18,720
had

404
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,240
everything on it lots of uh bob from the

405
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
uk i can't remember her second name

406
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,639
though sorry bob

407
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,399
he's the counterterrorism officer for

408
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,760
the uk

409
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,279
leaked a secret document getting over

410
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,800
his car without realizing someone was

411
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
taking photos of the street and happened

412
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,079
to have the document that said secret

413
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,839
facing outwards these fails happen

414
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,320
everywhere

415
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,480
even law enforcement had these fails

416
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,839
where this was a journey i think was

417
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,279
baltimore they actually leaked

418
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,240
the a they put a screen map of they're

419
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,279
tracking something right that was

420
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,399
happening at the time

421
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
i'm not realizing it they posted all

422
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,760
their favorite links

423
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
each flavor had a breakdown of who they

424
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,839
were investigating at the time

425
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,639
such as map mass action against police

426
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,040
brutality they were checking

427
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,480
someone just posted bob quick you're

428
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,040
right sorry my bad

429
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,680
so mass action police brutality that's

430
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,120
those one group you're looking at

431
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,240
there's multiple groups you're looking

432
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,600
at using intel techniques you see all

433
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,720
that we're using their

434
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,120
periscope fees people you see all the

435
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
information that's there

436
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,480
but it's not just photos here's a very

437
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,920
interesting one a lot of people know

438
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,480
about

439
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
was font game there's a lot of things

440
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,760
out there such as this post that came

441
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,320
out

442
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,519
this is a document that was meant to be

443
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,480
signed in 26 2006 and leaked out

444
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,880
and put everywhere all over the place i

445
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,320
was put out for everyone to see and be

446
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,560
like okay this document was signed 2006

447
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
we're off the hook turns out to use the

448
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,000
clipper font in the original document

449
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,279
that was meant to be signed

450
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,639
now clipper fault as you can see here

451
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,880
was only introduced in 2007 and wasn't

452
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,160
actually available in the region before

453
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,120
2007.

454
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,519
so the document was obviously forged now

455
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,560
again

456
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
not just documents not just photos it's

457
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
also audio i use

458
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,800
i love hearing it because there's

459
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
another friend of mine sticks he's a

460
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,440
little guy he

461
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,959
sits he sits in the discord he was

462
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,160
talking with this one time i i got

463
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
looking into it really into it people

464
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,519
have mechanically loaded keyboards

465
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,720
they're sitting there typing away and

466
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,079
typing away

467
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
and they're thinking you know what the

468
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,199
audio

469
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,399
what if you can convert the audio into

470
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,839
text in which it's happening people are

471
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,199
doing that so we're realizing you're in

472
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
an open source environment you're in a

473
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,880
location that's open to everyone

474
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,199
and it's using a simple tool to capture

475
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,160
your audio

476
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,000
they're converting your audio into key

477
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,079
press

478
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,199
so you gotta be careful with that stuff

479
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,560
people don't realize this happens it

480
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,880
happens

481
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
so as i always go thanks for the intel

482
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,000
because there was great intel on this

483
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,959
exact post

484
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,600
so a friend of mine casey posted about

485
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,320
in dublin

486
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,839
they got a brand new apartment with a

487
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,839
view of the bridge and he was off the

488
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,880
wetter springs for the night to have a

489
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,079
set for the boys

490
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,959

491
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,160

493
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,720

495
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
there going oh god no he didn't

496
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,240
because i just realized he just posted

497
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,360
whatever you need to tell us about where

498
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
he was

499
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
you just said 14b how many apartments

500
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,079
have a view of the bridge that would

501
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,279
have 14 levels

502
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,959
never mind 14 levels of enough

503
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,680
apartments to have 14 a or b

504
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,959
not many buildings kind of breaks down

505
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,240
very quick and then he did something

506
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,279
stupid he posted a picture of his key

507
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,040
there's probably your key like this

508
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,240
isn't actually his key by the way i have

509
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
to cover him up that way

510
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,199
he posted the key right okay

511
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
cool he posted being very proud i got a

512
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,639
new key to my apartment awesome

513
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
but didn't realize it had metadata with

514
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,560
a gps location exactly to the building

515
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
and then it went even further because we

516
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,959
started digging and at the time he

517
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,920
didn't realize

518
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,279
that myself and another researcher

519
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
called numlock were playing around 3d

520
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,079
printing keys

521
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,600
and actually got a working key for the

522
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,199
luck

523
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,800
so we rocked up to his house one day

524
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
opened his front door and said hi to him

525
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,000
he was so shocked

526
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
so from that singular post that included

527
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
that photo we got tons of information

528
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,720
we got his gps location room number we

529
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,240
had how long he's gonna be gone

530
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
we had a possible there's a working

531
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,000
design of his key we department floor

532
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,959
plans

533
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,040
we had how a knee brady planned to be so

534
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,240
let's say for example i was breaking to

535
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,040
his house

536
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,000
and i was gonna rob him he i knew

537
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,440
exactly how drunk he was going to be

538
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,959
when he got home so i could take care of

539
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,199
him if i had to

540
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,959
he i knew exactly how far he's going to

541
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,320
be away so if i kept him on for his

542
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,839
feeds and he just had a post up saying

543
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,279
hey just leaving the pub now boys i'll

544
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,279
let you know when i'm home we know

545
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,160
pretty quickly

546
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,480
how long he's going to get home we have

547
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,600
an idea how long it's going to take him

548
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,560
to get back there

549
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,600
so we've got loads of him and this

550
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,279
happens regularly people post pictures

551
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,279
of their car keys online or post sell

552
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,480
the kids post selfies

553
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,839
in the background a selfie like their

554
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,759
brand new bmw keys sitting there

555
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,440
and someone goes is going out and making

556
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,040
copies of their key based off the photo

557
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,320
it happens regularly it's just tons of

558
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,120
research on it

559
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
it's easily found online so eventually

560
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
after a while you start seeing

561
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,320
absolutely

562
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
everything in photos for example i was

563
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,519
talking a fruit on snapchat one day and

564
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,320
i can't remember what we're talking

565
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,519
about the situation was screwed up

566
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,880
pretty bad apparently

567
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,959
i was sitting there i was like whoa i

568
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,480
see something here

569
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,800
there's a reflection okay let's screw

570
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,480
around the reflection

571
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
we zoom in we look at it okay we zoom in

572
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
again we flip around turn it okay it

573
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,799
looks good

574
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
we got something here so i start

575
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,079
thinking it's fruit it's fruit i know

576
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,280
fruit i know fruit well

577
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
let's check for its facebook oh wait

578
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,119
wait fruit was watching hackers of

579
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,400
course wait it's fruit of course

580
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,679
fruit loves hackers if you know fruit

581
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,439
she loves hackers obviously so let's

582
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,799
start watching hackers do we find a

583
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,839
point

584
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,599
well okay this looks pretty good that's

585
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,880
pretty good

586
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,959
hang on a second yeah yeah yeah we match

587
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,280
it up okay it works

588
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,720
pretty quickly you found a fruit was

589
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
just watching hackers figure out what

590
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,520
frame it was pretty quickly based on

591
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,600
that single photo she posted now then

592
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,360
again it's only a faux it's harmless

593
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,840
it's of

594
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,600
hackers the movie but what if it was a

595
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,360
front door outside our house

596
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,520
what if it was a card outside our house

597
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
what was our car reflection of the car

598
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,640
window over the dress

599
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,280
so the thing about people when it comes

600
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,200
down to it people are predictable

601
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,320
everyone's predictable but human nature

602
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,600
is above all things lazy harry peter

603
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
still talked about this it's very common

604
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
people are lazy we see it every single

605
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,400
day people are lazy

606
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
when we see go to parks we see people

607
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,280
who walk straight through corners

608
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,720
forgetting corners are actually there

609
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,760
they walk straight through and make

610
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,280
these paths and destroy the environment

611
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,039
so we know people are massively

612
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,160
predictable what happens when people are

613
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,880
predictable

614
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,200
well they knew back hundreds of years

615
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,640
ago that people were vastly predictably

616
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,760
prepared people for this and no one

617
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,960
really listened to them

618
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
so rogers rangers standing order of

619
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,480
robert rogers if you don't know

620
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,520
i'm sure there's rangers out there who

621
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,640
don't understand roger robbers and

622
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,679
standing orders

623
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,039
has set our guidelines for rogers

624
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,840
rangers back in 1759

625
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,559
number 11 on this list was don't march

626
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,440
home the same way

627
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,799
take a different route so you don't be

628
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,640
ambushed

629
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
they understood back then that people

630
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,000
were lazy and took the same paths

631
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,320
and were just predictable they

632
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
understood that the problem

633
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,320
predictability again is

634
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,320
predictable you can map out someone's

635
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,240
exact location to point of the roots

636
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,080
right they take the roads you take

637
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,000
the streets you use mainly the shops you

638
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,360
go to the pubs you go to the nightclub

639
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,919
you go to

640
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,600
it all makes sense and the problem with

641
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,039
having this kind of information having

642
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,080
the public especially when it's

643
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,200
predictable

644
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,480
is you start getting information like

645
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
cameras cameras are out there and if

646
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,280
someone's predictable they're gonna walk

647
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,120
by the cameras

648
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,160
that leads us straight into like

649
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,640
predictability equals trackable right

650
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,000
people will argue and say no it's not

651
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,559
but then again i'd argue and say it is

652
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,039
so for example i was gonna call with

653
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,919
someone discord and he said you're

654
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,039
running one six eight plus and they're

655
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:23,679
going down

656
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,640
going through london and we're just

657
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,919
about to get off the bus and get off the

658
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
bus then 19 nearly hit them

659
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
that's whoa okay 19 nearly hit you

660
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,520
that's terrible so i got the one six

661
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
eight bus three

662
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,080
i got the 19 bus right i crossed the

663
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,520
creek and crossed them across and got

664
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,120
ideas like overlaying them i was like

665
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
okay i know exactly where they are

666
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,360
i start looking the photo cameras in the

667
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,320
area start looking at different things

668
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,840
in the area

669
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,960
and then i notice i found rag very

670
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,280
quickly

671
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,880
people are predictable when you're

672
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,919
predictable you're trackable

673
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,760
and it happens regularly and like we do

674
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,440
it regularly as fun we take selfies

675
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,880
ourselves this is myself and alan the

676
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,159
blank who was on talking earlier

677
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,080
same topic good friend of mine we were

678
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,520
in temple bar and we decided to take a

679
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,200
good selfie of ourselves

680
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,960
it was a great selfie perfect timing to

681
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
do it we're using open source

682
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,960
information

683
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,120
where we were in theory we could attract

684
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,320
someone walking across the area if we

685
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,720
had this camera as well

686
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,159
so connecting these dots it's all about

687
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,280
connecting the dots and bits of

688
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,679
information that you can connect

689
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,520
for example you start off with john doe

690
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
simple little bit of information

691
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
you expand out known as social media

692
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,880
accounts you start looking at social

693
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
media accounts

694
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,840
you find out using this username from

695
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,960
their usernames you get john those

696
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,080
usernames you get all the information

697
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,480
those

698
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,760
types of usernames use you start

699
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,039
searching other databases getting

700
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,400
information and adding everything up and

701
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,200
start figuring out

702
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,960
okay john doe's in this location he

703
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,320
posted a selfie from this place he

704
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,840
posted a post from this place

705
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,799
you start adding that up and then

706
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,039
eventually start building a map

707
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,960
that can be built out to the process or

708
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,559
understanding person after a good couple

709
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,520
of hours or

710
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,799
months in some cases specifically in

711
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,880
this case i'm talking about it took

712
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,080
we got to this point where it was just

713
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,760
craziness but we had the person tracked

714
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,640
into a detail

715
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,240
we knew everything they were going to do

716
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,960
seven days a week so we knew on a monday

717
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,480
he went for coffee on a tuesday he went

718
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,440
to college

719
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,799
he'd learn everything and when that

720
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,799
happens oil stuff happens

721
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,320
but people are predictable and it's easy

722
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
to track especially it comes to missing

723
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,320
people

724
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,919
people people are the same it comes to

725
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,559
missing people it's getting information

726
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,760
and pulling information together so

727
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,480
you're sitting there you're probably

728
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
like oh i got great upset i've got an

729
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,840
amazing upset

730
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,280
most people do they always think that it

731
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,559
was sitting in my talk and go yeah great

732
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,000
upset so did this guy

733
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,520
this guy post on twitter a while back

734
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,120
and was like come to you flip my cube

735
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,200
so i was sitting here i was looking i

736
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
was like there's not much information

737
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,440
here

738
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,360
so uh let's have a look deeper oh wait

739
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
there's a phone let's pull the phone and

740
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,520
find a type of phone

741
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,880
phone type phone look at the type of

742
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,200
phone this guy was in a certain

743
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,039
country that type of phone was only

744
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,799
available to a certain university

745
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,799
and he publicly posted with buying a lot

746
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,840
more some of these phones

747
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,280
which basically brought me down to a

748
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,720
pretty quick point of figuring out

749
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,159
exactly where this guy was based off a

750
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,960
phone shape on his desk

751
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,919
upset is breakable massively breakable

752
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,039
and we'll do this because i'm challenged

753
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,480
to do this regularly by people

754
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
so example these tweets hundreds of

755
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
tweets of people ask me to constantly

756
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
break up sick or

757
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,480
break their upset or find them let's

758
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,520
take a look at some of these

759
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,320
here's your case studies so rag for

760
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,760
example

761
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,679
rag posted this on facebook to me then

762
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,120
me on facebook was hey

763
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,360
find me your challenge so first thing i

764
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,400
did was text fruit i was like fruit

765
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
start a timer going for a rag

766
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
so got the photo started looking at the

767
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
photo got the landmarks out looking at

768
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
the landmarks pretty cool stuff right

769
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,520
landmarks are good find one landmark

770
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,799
search against everything so i started

771
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,400
searching bridge next to a ferris wheel

772
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,679
not many of them in the world the phone

773
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,799
went pretty quickly

774
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,400
cross reference yeah it worked pretty

775
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,159
good works pretty good crosses very well

776
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,440
start looking at cameras around the area

777
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,880
see the cameras then line up the cameras

778
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,240
in the view of the actual windows get an

779
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
idea where they are located

780
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,320
cross reference hall on google maps bam

781
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,280
got the building

782
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,760
cool so pretty quickly figured out that

783
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,120
rag was in the mc suites

784
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,520
at that time now of course i could text

785
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,120
dragonblade hey i found you

786
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,320
fruit stop the timer but no i had like

787
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,520
i wasn't running to five minute mark so

788
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,559
i said i'll have a bit of fun so i

789
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,880
decided to ring rag instead

790
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,000
unfortunately i don't have the audio

791
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,120
here because rag wouldn't let me use the

792
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,159
audio but

793
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,919
i have the text the text i'm not going

794
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,039
to read it out because it's a lot of

795
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,600
reading

796
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,960
and it's on my blog if anyone wants to

797
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,039
read it but it was an interesting way

798
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,159
don't i do this regularly through i

799
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,039
always call right just for the fun of it

800
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,159
so i got challenged again but ben boyer

801
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,200
guy

802
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,919
go dogs me so cool no problem again we

803
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,919
look at the same thing

804
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,240
i got it pretty quickly i think it was

805
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,919
within 15 20 minutes of the original

806
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,559
post

807
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,559
so got it not even the location down to

808
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,919
the window

809
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,279
so how was this done we got the original

810
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,360
photo of course what we do originally is

811
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,080
skyline okay marking the main objects

812
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
okay cool cool

813
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
we find us information about the person

814
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,679
pretty quickly we're like okay he's a

815
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,480
b-sides

816
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,039
newcastle elder cool it's confirmed it's

817
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,760
peace castle

818
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
besides newcastle okay we've got the

819
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,120
information where the location kind of

820
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
is

821
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,080
we started with clock towers in that

822
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,399
area

823
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,559
clocked areas match up it works very

824
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,320
well okay we got clocked our matches

825
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,159
we confirm it yeah it looks pretty good

826
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,600
to the photo

827
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,679
right so we look on a map we're like

828
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,799
okay we've got the clock tower we've got

829
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,320
location got new castle clock tower

830
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,760
where else is around them so we start

831
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,279
going crazy eyes and everything you know

832
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,400
the gif you see online like you're

833
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,440
trying to point there and figure out

834
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,159
everything

835
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,679
yeah that's what that was happening at

836
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,520
this point for me where i was gonna go

837
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,799
okay okay what building around looks

838
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,600
good

839
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,520
okay we got two points guess what the

840
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,120
gauge of the points we got the other way

841
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
no there's nothing derek could be in a

842
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,080
building but what if we go the opposite

843
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,600
direction this

844
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
boom we got the apartments okay cool we

845
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,440
got an apartment

846
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
we line it up we awesome we even got the

847
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,039
roof it came from so we know pretty

848
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,320
quickly where this person wasn't taking

849
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,440
a photo

850
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
awesome we start looking at different

851
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,799
things in the photo like the roof so the

852
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,159
scale the windows the roof

853
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,240
the actual building itself and start

854
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,000
matching up to different locations

855
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,520
we start cross reference the photo back

856
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,960
to the window to even figure out what

857
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,000
point the window was taken

858
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
from eventually it comes down to a point

859
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,320
that i'm challenged

860
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,439
every single day on this

861
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,520
jenny radcliffe posted this one online

862
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,799
this is a tough one for a lot of people

863
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,080
but i figured it pretty quick

864
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,440
as you can see here i was challenged

865
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,200
again pretty quick

866
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,480
commonly it's so common it happens so i

867
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,919
replied again of course is my usual

868
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,360
fashion within like half an hour later

869
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,480
basically with the location of the

870
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,840
camera outside the location telling her

871
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,039
exactly where she was

872
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,039
and of course i wasn't just right i was

873
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,559
right to the point of

874
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,000
i had the exact floor and everything was

875
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,080
taken from but we'll talk about that so

876
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,760
we'll get into how it's done though

877
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,720
so again remember people small details

878
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,799
landmarks

879
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,080
what landmarks we have here we have a

880
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,159
shopping mall a church that's london

881
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,200
shard

882
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,480
and i the london eye stands out

883
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,400
okay london i confirmed it was london we

884
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,840
knew it straight away just had to

885
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,679
confirm it

886
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,039
google maps bring it up pretty quickly

887
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,960
you got the london shard we cross

888
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
reference that with the with the angle

889
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,840
of view with the with the coca-cola

890
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,400
tower

891
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,679
coco london eye get up pretty quickly

892
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,720
we have an idea like already where it is

893
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,400
okay so what else can we do we shall

894
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,080
play the shard 360 camera

895
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,240
the chart has a camera at this 360 view

896
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,360
you see all around it

897
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,320
it's great really high quality as well

898
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,440
so we're looking at the camera

899
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,679
we turn it around we go oh hang on a

900
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,200
second as a returning room we noticed

901
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,080
something

902
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,720
that building looks familiar the

903
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,679
building looks pretty

904
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,080
pretty familiar okay cool we move in we

905
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,520
are closer yeah no it definitely looks

906
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,240
right

907
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,679
we got a shop sign we see the shop

908
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,880
and then we just gonna turn and look up

909
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,400
this shop we got pretty quick okay

910
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,919
aerial starts look pretty good

911
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,159
looks pretty good so we can cross

912
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,200
reference that against the building the

913
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,840
angle of

914
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,120
view of what we're looking at already

915
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,039
and we got the building the four seasons

916
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,520
hotel

917
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,640
sorry of course solved it pretty quick

918
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,000
and it was knowing to the point of

919
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,279
solved i actually got the floor she was

920
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,799
staying on at the time

921
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,639
i got myself a nice bc liverpool ticket

922
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,480
so we've got some multiple honorable

923
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,720
mentions here there's multiple

924
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,000
this happens regularly so we have

925
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,360
hundreds we have like

926
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,240
tracking tracking from a hotel to london

927
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,360
the airport in london

928
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,440
we have tracking houses we got track and

929
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
apartment blocks we've checked in uh

930
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,320
matt well matt's in liverpool some crazy

931
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,200
pedros

932
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,399
we've got multiple this happens

933
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,840
regularly i even got one right in the

934
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,960
center there which i was going to leave

935
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,679
in but i said

936
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,480
save time i won't i was tracking mcafee

937
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,520
based on his bunker

938
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,880
while stitching together all parts of

939
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,279
his photo

940
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,640
so challenges everywhere so if you want

941
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,159
to learn this is what i really recommend

942
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,480
looking at

943
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,520
so the cia they dropped they dropped a

944
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,200
challenge on instagram

945
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,039
i spotted my little lie and

946
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,240
it wasn't really a challenge was more of

947
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,679
a post just say what was going on so

948
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,880
let's use it as a challenge though

949
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,000
because there's a lot of information we

950
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,360
got here

951
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,720
so we look at the photo really high

952
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
quality photo

953
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
we look look at it we got we got an id

954
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,159
badge so quickly i noticed the id badge

955
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,520
looked something familiar so i tracked

956
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,640
and used facial

957
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,120
facial comparisons facial recognition i

958
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,240
picked up was the ci

959
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
cia director was her profile photo on

960
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,360
the badge

961
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,799
then i noticed that the badge number was

962
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,720
09 1947

963
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,200
or 1947 which is the date to see i was

964
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,240
created september 1947.

965
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
we look further we got turkish in the

966
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,679
table of protection

967
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,399
we've got a photo of anton and tony tony

968
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,200
mandez

969
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,720
which if you don't know the argo film

970
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,679
the iranian er incidentally

971
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,279
he was the main perpetrator and this is

972
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,960
his photo it was painting and found him

973
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,080
on the desk which was compared against

974
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,440
his photo which was then compared

975
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,240
against his id

976
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,840
which found out exactly who he was

977
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,360
so the clock as well clock was

978
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,720
interesting the clock had a piece of

979
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
melting clock it was found to be a part

980
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,440
of nine of the

981
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
twin towers and the reason i found out

982
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,799
it was because it was a

983
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,559
listing of that of a box by the cia on

984
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,000
their website for the deputy director

985
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,760
talking about was metal in a box from

986
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,120
the twin towers and he used to smell it

987
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,399
all the time in his office

988
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,600
because he could still smell the burning

989
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,440
off it the clock itself

990
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,480
nothing really too spectacular

991
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
spectacular but i'm special about it but

992
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,520
the time of the clock was the

993
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,000
interesting

994
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,640
part the time was from 846 which is when

995
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,120
the

996
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
hijackers actually took control control

997
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,399
the plane and crashed planes into the

998
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,360
tower

999
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,279
so there's a little bit of history saved

1000
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,279
in this photo

1001
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,679
there was money on the desk latin latin

1002
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,440
american money and also

1003
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,120
asian money we also had a burn bag under

1004
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,840
the table

1005
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,039
of course you know what burn bag is this

1006
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,720
destroying evidence for an information

1007
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,760
classified documents

1008
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,320
you don't stop there there was an eyes

1009
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,840
only stamp and a classified sticker and

1010
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,200
at the time i was so confused with his

1011
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
classified stickers it didn't make sense

1012
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,720
because the sticker didn't there's no

1013
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,440
type that sticker out there anywhere

1014
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,559
but after talking to some people i

1015
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,520
figured out that that wasn't actually

1016
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
sticker it was a seal and i never

1017
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,080
actually updated the slide now

1018
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,360
maps in the wall the maps of certain

1019
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
locations in the world we understand

1020
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,840
operation locations

1021
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,399
this brass cell shows greece it's from

1022
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,840
greece from greece it's a greek island

1023
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,399
from

1024
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,200
certain parts of greece it's all online

1025
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
the money on the counter is from

1026
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,679
does european money there is a british

1027
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,120
money and the u.s silver dollars

1028
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,399
there's a comic book on the counter a

1029
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,399
bit of research friendly comic book

1030
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,840
but when i started looking i was like

1031
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,440
that's not enough in the comic book

1032
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,640
and then i realized there's something

1033
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,919
very special about the comic book they

1034
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,760
have on the table

1035
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,039
it's a cia only comic book

1036
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,320
and it's very hard to come by but you

1037
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,720
can find on online readers

1038
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,320
so they have a rare comic on the table

1039
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,480
there's a mass collection of books of

1040
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,440
information

1041
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,520
so we have books secrets of the cia

1042
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,679
humor we've sisterhood of spies

1043
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,320
we have spies black supplies black ties

1044
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,360
and mango pies

1045
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,320
a cookbook for spies official cra manual

1046
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,520
of trickery deception we've got a bunch

1047
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,000
of books on the table

1048
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,760
we've also got arabic writing now if

1049
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,039
someone here can translate the arabic

1050
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,240
right it would be great i'd love to be

1051
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,880
able to know what

1052
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,159
actually finally says because i've been

1053
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,760
messing around with this for ages trying

1054
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,640
to get to work and

1055
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,960
i cannot get this to work properly on

1056
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,919
any translator

1057
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,519
no matter how much i extrude or try

1058
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,919
working

1059
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,440
there's also a silver star on the table

1060
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
which is obviously a carve out the star

1061
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,480
of

1062
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,640
this ci1st

1063
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,159
the maps on the table all map out the

1064
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,919
different regions of the

1065
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,559
persian gulf so we understand our

1066
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,360
operational error

1067
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,440
global table nothing really spectacular

1068
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
order that was a globe that was from

1069
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,960
a different country it was probably

1070
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,039
brought in as a present or as a gift or

1071
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,720
return gift

1072
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,000
the bamboo was interesting though

1073
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
because the bamboo took me a minute to

1074
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,720
look at the bamboo and realized

1075
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,120
it's a very specific type of bamboo that

1076
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,840
comes from the mountains in latin

1077
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,320
america

1078
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,440
so from all this information adding

1079
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,399
together we're starting to get things

1080
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,519
you know there's phones in the table

1081
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,480
with headphones

1082
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,120
so the folders we see it says in anise

1083
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,559
based on cleaning up as much as we can

1084
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,080
it says in a nice

1085
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,880
a nice is a only located place in syria

1086
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
so it could be an operational area of

1087
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,519
syria

1088
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,799
a small town very interesting we started

1089
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,919
digging into it and i started

1090
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,600
trying to learn this but it was a really

1091
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,559
bad time i was trying to learn

1092
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,600
handwritten analysis

1093
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,240
to figure out how the handwriting

1094
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,760
affected the person i heard a person to

1095
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,159
identify a person based off hand right

1096
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,320
was not easy to do so i'm not an expert

1097
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,600
but this was my attempt

1098
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,480
so i decided to add that anyway there

1099
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,919
was also challenge coins so the

1100
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,840
challenge comes break down to uh the k9

1101
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,480
the cia

1102
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,320
so there too i wasn't able to figure out

1103
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,279
in the time frame i had

1104
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,840
there's also lapel pins on the pin right

1105
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,279
so this is an interesting one

1106
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,120
one of the lapel pins was a very

1107
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,039
specific pin to the oss

1108
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,880
75th anniversary so if you understand

1109
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
what the oss is there's a predecessor or

1110
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,320
cia

1111
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,720
it was also a 10-year federal service

1112
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,159
pin lapel pin

1113
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,399
and it was also the lanyard was on was

1114
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,279
civil affairs so

1115
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,799
pretty straight gives it away

1116
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,799
so what did we get from this information

1117
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,080
like we got a lot of information from

1118
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,480
that

1119
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
but what do we have so it's a photo yeah

1120
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,399
okay it's this challenge put out there

1121
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,600
well i'm looking i'm i've got

1122
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,320
intelligence now so we've got ideas

1123
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,679
we've got information we've figured out

1124
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,200
so much information from this

1125
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,399
we figured so much information this

1126
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,600
photo what else have we figured out

1127
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,519
we got to the point of we have the

1128
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,360
information that we can almost identify

1129
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,960
who it is

1130
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
we've got the agent is obviously a

1131
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,600
member of public affairs because they're

1132
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,200
using public affairs lanyards and equip

1133
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
don't do stuff around them they've been

1134
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,120
this cia already been a federal employee

1135
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,039
for over 10 years

1136
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,279
the agent has traveled a lot based on

1137
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,880
souvenirs and information

1138
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,279
also mainly latin america region based

1139
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,080
on the money

1140
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,360
and the type of plant that's there as

1141
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,640
well as the photos and documents are

1142
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,200
also on the table

1143
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,799
we've also got the agent might that

1144
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,640
might actually be older they might be

1145
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,880
older late like they've got a lot of 70s

1146
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,159
kind of decoration like the wallpaper

1147
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:48,960
70s

1148
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
the carpet if you look at the carpet

1149
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,159
since the surface kind of air it's

1150
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,120
really old

1151
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,799
so it could be an older person that uses

1152
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,840
modern technology there's a lot of

1153
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,799
modern technology there

1154
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,679
the agent has an interest in middle

1155
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,640
eastern

1156
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,440
events based on text you know we can see

1157
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,480
possible iranian

1158
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,079
syrian posters we see a lot of

1159
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,918
information that links back to person

1160
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,280
the agent enjoys travelling wants to

1161
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,480
travel more obviously because we got

1162
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,079
travelling information we got more money

1163
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,918
and foreign money sit on the table

1164
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,599
and agent joe's reason obviously we got

1165
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,960
booked the bookshelf

1166
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,719
and also the asians possibly female the

1167
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,480
way we say that is because

1168
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,239
the id card is of the female and also

1169
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,239
the type of the clothing that's there is

1170
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,199
female oriented

1171
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,879
so olson actually can probably

1172
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,000
understand by now ocean can get scary

1173
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
it gets scary very easily this is some

1174
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,679
research that was done into looking into

1175
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,079
taking reflections of viruses people's

1176
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:42,719
viruses

1177
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,918
now if you don't know about this case it

1178
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,359
was a case that happened and it was

1179
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,440
people's irises were kind of like

1180
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,879
it was an assault that happened based on

1181
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,199
someone's iris that was out there scary

1182
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,879
it was a scary thing that happened

1183
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,079
actually kind of took me back when i

1184
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:54,719
realized

1185
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,480
okay this is something i was researching

1186
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,920
in and this was happening and it was

1187
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,839
scary

1188
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,119
but then it gets really scary when you

1189
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,320
start seeing more technologies there

1190
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,119
it's not just this

1191
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,359
there's also technology such as really

1192
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,800
high definition cameras

1193
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,640
this is what i have to put in for people

1194
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,160
they can get information from

1195
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,560
miles away that make this kind of stuff

1196
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,160
easier

1197
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,200
so when you're looking at this photo

1198
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,400
you're wondering okay it's a couple of

1199
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,640
miles away

1200
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,880
so we're zooming in we're zooming in

1201
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,839
we're trying to understand what's

1202
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,520
happening

1203
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,880
i mean you see a football game we see

1204
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,839
her playing american football in the

1205
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,440
field this technology is out there it's

1206
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,000
available

1207
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,560
it's really expensive but it can be gone

1208
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,680
i'll just show you the information we

1209
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,440
gathered that way

1210
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,400
so as well as bad as well as there's bad

1211
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,960
information

1212
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,880
bad ways doing things there is ocean for

1213
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
good out there and i really need to put

1214
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,680
yours out there there is people doing

1215
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,880
goodwill

1216
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,800
we got groups like trace labs badass

1217
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,119
army instant lives foundation

1218
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,960
bellingcat operation underground

1219
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
railroad these are great organizations

1220
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,640
for using open source intelligence and

1221
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,920
the information i'm talking about this

1222
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,480
talk

1223
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,160
to make a difference and i highly just

1224
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,680
recommend going out and supporting them

1225
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
and learning them and see going to them

1226
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,960
and dealing with them

1227
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,480
basically pumping up and making them

1228
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,960
amazing just push them out there

1229
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,240
let everybody know there's great

1230
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,000
organizations trace labs

1231
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,880
hold an amazing ctf regularly i highly

1232
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
recommend getting involved and i

1233
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,280
participate in regularly

1234
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,720
i won't be participating in the next one

1235
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,480
as i want to take a break from a little

1236
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,119
bit

1237
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,960
but then people participate in this and

1238
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
it helps locate missing people people

1239
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,240
are missing cold cases

1240
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,079
highly recommend giving a go and getting

1241
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,800
into and looking into it

1242
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,040
myself i regularly participate in help

1243
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,920
in the world

1244
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,520
this was during hurricane florence this

1245
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,880
is an old one hurricane florence

1246
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,119
happened in the us and south carolina

1247
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,800
i got involved not a lot i felt pretty

1248
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,240
bad i had family who were living in the

1249
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,680
area at the time so i was like

1250
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
i want to help out so i started using

1251
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,839
like zello got in touch with cajun navy

1252
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,400
got to touch different locations

1253
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,760
i started using weather track and

1254
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,839
started using open source cameras they

1255
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:50,240
try to

1256
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,839
keep locate people struck on their roofs

1257
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,520
or stuck in their houses then you'd help

1258
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,000
and i'd really relay back to cajun navy

1259
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,400
this is using ocean for good and i think

1260
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,359
using that even

1261
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,960
information the knowledge you have and

1262
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,079
the skills you have to be able to help

1263
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:02,960
and make a difference to the world is

1264
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,359
very important

1265
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,040
so we get into the part we're going to

1266
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,400
learn a little something else

1267
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,920
safe post so if you're sitting there i

1268
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,040
need to be able to defend myself a

1269
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,760
little bit

1270
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,720
there's a couple of rules you have to

1271
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,000
follow i'm allowed to post this

1272
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,280
that's the most important one how am i

1273
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,000
going to post this information

1274
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,200
does the post have metadata

1275
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,560
is the background of the photo clear

1276
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,160
remember go back to the keys the photo

1277
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,800
the keys in the background of the photo

1278
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,480
is there anything in the photo that is

1279
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,760
revealing such as the keys themselves

1280
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,440
is it okay to be online forever because

1281
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,720
once you post something online it's

1282
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,759
going to be there forever

1283
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,839
it's not just photos always remember

1284
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,880
it's not just photos that give away

1285
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,000
intelligence and information

1286
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,599
it's also what you say so remember

1287
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,200
sitting on discord talking away about

1288
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,079
hey i'm going on holidays let someone

1289
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:52,480
know

1290
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,680
you're going on holidays and your house

1291
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,079
is gonna be empty

1292
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,359
so what have you learned in my talk

1293
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,560
today you've learned a few things

1294
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,960
hopefully i hope you learned a bit

1295
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,839
see if they're the little things are

1296
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,800
intelligence

1297
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,920
you've learned how to look at different

1298
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,560
things differently than normally

1299
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,760
and how different little things and

1300
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,680
different angles change perspective of

1301
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,640
photos and how to understand it

1302
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,160
everything around you is absolute

1303
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,920
intelligence everything is intelligence

1304
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,160
from neon science to little tiny

1305
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,240
piece of paper to plant pots everything

1306
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,560
is intelligence

1307
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,440
there is intel literally everywhere

1308
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,200
posts online like this video from the

1309
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,320
from the us army that was put up online

1310
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,800
about

1311
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,119
of a cyber operation specialist shows

1312
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,480
programs running including splunk on

1313
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,880
their desktop

1314
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,560
professionals around the world mess up

1315
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,440
all the time it's very common

1316
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,040
and we also understand how to be a

1317
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,560
little bit safer online

1318
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,160

uh from ulster fenn great talk viking do

1334
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,320
you perform your ocean investigations in

1335
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,680
your spare time

1336
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,920
and if so what kind of cases would you

1337
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,960
investigate

1338
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,520
to improve your ocean skill set can you

1339
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,400
offer any specific resources

1340
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,119
so uh yeah i do i do this a lot in my

1341
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,880
spare time it's more of a hobby for me

1342
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,960
than anything else and

1343
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
i kind of i love doing i really enjoy

1344
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,320
doing it i've yet to actually get a

1345
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,160
career in it yet but we'll see

1346
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,720
but uh i love doing it i really do it's

1347
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,000
all spare time

1348
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,839
and the kind of case i work on it's

1349
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,119
everything so i've worked on

1350

1352
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,200
cases i've worked on uh missing people

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,040
suicidal people tracking in suicide

1354
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,400
people

with as well who do this too

1362
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,720
and we do a lot as for resources start

1363
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,680
getting into this

1364
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,119
get your friends to challenge you that's

1365
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,560
the best way that's how i started get

1366
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,920
your friends to challenge you and start

1367
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,760
using stuff like source and games

1368
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,560
i really recommend that site but uh get

1369
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,280
it to get your friends

1370
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,560
challenges the best one it's always the

1371
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,400
fun fun when you go online and go on

1372
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
reddit right now and go hashtag awesome

1373
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,640
challenge

1374
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,839
and see what you can pull mclabrow wants

1375
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:30,480
to know

1376
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,960
what's your favorite dinosaur oh

1377
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,599
oh that's a good one because every

1378
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,359
single time i answer that when he gives

1379
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,760
me it's a different dinosaur stegosaurus

1380
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
and uh we got another question here

1381
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
apparently it's a vague question

1382
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,000
but is there a line that you won't cross

1383
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,280
when doing ocean

1384
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,839
for example verging on more of a gray

1385
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,359
area

1386
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,520
yeah i i have i do have my own morals

1387
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,440
and i do have my own ethics on this

1388
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,480
uh i won't do it if um it's attack if

1389
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,680
it's against someone like if it's

1390
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,040
offensive unless it's

1391
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,119
work late and have full permission to it

1392
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,240
i won't do unless

1393
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,160
it's affecting someone the only time i

1394
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,760
will ever go ahead and do also without

1395
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,200
someone's permission is if

1396
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,640
there's a legitimate concern for their

1397
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,000
safety such as they're missing or

1398
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,119
something's happening

1399
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,880
you have to have ethics there is no

1400
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,319
rules out there for this you have to

1401
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,839
have your own morals and your own ethics

1402
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,520
with dealing with this and every single

1403
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,400
case you work on

1404
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,960
is case by case specific so it changes

1405
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,640
every time you do something different

1406
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,319
so every time you can meet different per

1407
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,680
different missing person case it's

1408
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,960
different from the last one it's not the

1409
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,640
exact same rules and rules engagement

1410
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,280
this

1411
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,880
so it's it's very hard to give an answer

1412
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,280
like that but i do myself

1413
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,880
have my own morals and ethics or places

1414
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,200
i won't tread and most commonly

1415
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,560
i don't touch friends and i don't touch

1416
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,599
family that's my my first go-to

1417
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,760
no friends someone here with a username

1418
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,200
that i won't pronounce

1419
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,839
says are there any resources or groups

1420
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,160
of resources that you would suggest

1421
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,240
they're interested in the image of

1422
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,799
oceans

1423
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,880
resources uh hook up a trace labs

1424
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,480
get involved and look at how trace labs

1425
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,280
work trace labs are absolutely amazing

1426
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,079
organization

1427
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,520
look at bellingcat bellincotta's

1428
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
reporters the stuff they do is

1429
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,880
spectacular some like the stuff that

1430
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,480
comes up they

1431
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,359
blows my mind sometimes but i definitely

1432
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,640
recommend checking them out and having a

1433
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,680
look and

1434
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,400
seeing how they go and we got someone

1435
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,560
else asking what sorts of tools do you

1436
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,800
recommend for compiling intel

1437
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,079
and also what does ride's hair look like

1438
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,560
right now

1439
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,760
well i couldn't tell you what rags hair

1440
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,040
look actually wait wait brag send me

1441
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,079
yourself you all know

1442
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,280
but but uh as for

1443
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,160
compiling information uh i just write my

1444
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,960
own report

1445
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,800
template and add all the information to

1446
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,400
report template and uh

1447
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,839
just get that out if you're talking

1448
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,520
about tool-wise of what do i do to

1449
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,200
actually get it information

1450
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,240
everything is done manually i don't do

1451
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,760
anything with tools i don't like using

1452
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,280
tools many because you get lazy

1453
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,400
and you can always get a lot of false

1454
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,240
positives i specifically like doing a

1455
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,440
manual i think it's very important to

1456
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,560
learn things manually

1457
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,760
it's the same as learning to pitch a

1458
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,119
tent you can go and get one of these

1459
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,400
fancy pop-up tents

1460
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,720
but it's no good knowing a pop-up tent

1461
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,920
if you can't

1462
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,599
pitch a tent that's a good way it's

1463
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,680
saying fish wants to know what you're

1464
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,640
doing

1465
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,040
what am i doing uh right now i'm about

1466
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,480
to pour a whiskey and relax i think

1467
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,200
crypto cipher wants to know do you find

1468
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,440
using moltek always likely to slow you

1469
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,960
down

1470
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,440
hey use them all to go slow me down uh

1471
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,079
yeah

1472
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,119
like multiple's great i never use it for

1473
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,079
its

1474
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,560
use it's actual purposes i ever use

1475
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,240
multigo to actually use as a mind map to

1476
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,359
be able to

1477
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,960
map out connections and find connections

1478
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,079
between people and connect and hold up

1479
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,480
mclabre wants to know would you fight a

1480
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,560
hundred duck-sized horses

1481
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,160
or one horse-sized duck i wouldn't for a

1482
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:54,960
horse

1483
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,920
because i like horses ducks ducks can be

1484
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,280
weird sometimes so

1485
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,400
i'll take on all the ducks because

1486
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,359
dennis they don't kill you at least

1487
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,480
you're going to be surrounding cuteness

1488
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,800
