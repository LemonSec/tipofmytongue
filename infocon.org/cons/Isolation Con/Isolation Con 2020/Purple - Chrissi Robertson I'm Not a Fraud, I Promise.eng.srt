um in the chat on twitch and probably on

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,360
discord as well

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,600
discord um

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,520
so let me start this talk with one

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,040
simple statement

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,080
i'm not a fraud i promise

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,360
um so who is this fruit why is it not

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,920
clicking

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
there we go um as you may have seen in

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,159
that last slide and from the

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,159
introduction from andy and chrissy

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,200
i'm christine or chrissy i'm a software

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,720
engineer at critical software a

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,280
part-time

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,640
computer science student at the open

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
university and a moderator on leave at

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,079
the mini hats club

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,240
i'd love to be my analyst when i'm older

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,079
i really love hippos i love the color

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,560
pink

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,680
and spooky things and i'm also really

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,439
super dumb

55
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,280
uh this is just one example of me

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,200
calling myself dumb over the two years

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,119
i've been part of the mini hats club

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,159
and honestly it probably isn't gonna be

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,960
the last

60
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,080
um

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
but why saying this and broadcasting in

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,319
this talk because of imposter syndrome

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,360
so what exactly makes me qualified to

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
talk about imposter syndrome

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,400
the funny thing is i don't think i am

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
i only submit this talk because it's the

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
only thing i can really talk about

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
i don't do interesting things with

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,040
security or

70
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,680
at all because i have so much other

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
stuff going on you know

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,120
and i experience imposter syndrome

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,160
every time i'm in tmhc or at conferences

74
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,360
or when i'm at work or at meetups i

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
exist

76
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,280
as an imposter

77
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,239
so i'll give you a bit of history i left

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,560
high school with 13 gcses they start to

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,680
see

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
i'm a nerd but we all are right

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
uh the backstory really starts here

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
i wasn't interested in doing well

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,159
academically i wanted to be a rock star

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,280
but not like a

85
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,319
infosec rockstar i wanted to be a

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,360
bonafide

87
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
warped tour black leather all the time

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
tattoos and piercings

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,519
rock star uh my dad

90
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
put a lot of pressure on me to achieve

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,440
good grades and

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
even when i was three marks off an a in

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
maths a subject i hated and

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
still hate um it just

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,760
wasn't good enough i should have been

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
getting a's

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,599
i went to college and they pressured me

98
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,519
to do a levels because my gcses were

99
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,000
just

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,159
so good their words not mine um

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,920
they didn't understand why i wanted to

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,560
take a btec of all things and i was too

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
embarrassed to say that my anxiety was

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,200
sky

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,319
high whenever i was in exams all i

106
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,200
wanted

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920
was to be able to submit my work get my

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,480
grade

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,959
and know where i stand and rescue my

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,400
overall grade if i needed to

111
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
needless to say i didn't really do that

112
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
well with my

113
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,560
a levels and i moved on to a full-time b

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,879
tech in it

115
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
unfortunately um

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
my college didn't have the best i.t

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
department and through a combination

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,560
of low-quality teaching and bullying

119
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,759
from the senior management of the

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,120
college

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
when i finished that course i swore

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
fighty completely

123
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,320
i actually went to be a chef because

124
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,759
food is the good stuff

125
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,520
and anthony bourdain was one of my

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,280
heroes um

127
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
i was able to spend some time training

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,639
at a michelin-starred restaurant

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,440
but my anxiety came into play again i

130
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
had panic attacks in the kitchen

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,240
and for anyone who doesn't know that

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,440
really isn't safe so

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,720
what now a writing community i was in at

134
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,000
the time was freaking

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
out about a particular piece of malware

136
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,680
that was

137
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
really prevalent at the time it was the

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,600
first of its kind

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,240
no one had seen it before ransomware

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,320
that encrypts files

141
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
i mean now it's commonplace when we say

142
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
ransomware we mean things that encrypt

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,919
files but at the time

144
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,039
no one had seen it before

145
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,440
everyone i knew was scared about getting

146
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
infected

147
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,080
and i was sat there in my corner of the

148
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,080
internet going that's really cool

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,120
so i started wondering towards in for a

150
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
second back into it

151
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,840
i got a job as a help desk analyst i

152
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,880
joined twitter

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,840
again and stuck myself in i joined

154
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,600
manchester gray hats and through some

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,440
looks spoke to stu

156
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,600
about how i came from professional

157
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,639
kitchens

158
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,400
to trying my damned best to be a hacker

159
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
i joined tmhc and that year i started

160
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,639
going to conferences

161
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,120
i met wonderful people who did amazing

162
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,960
things

163
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,000
and how could i compare

164
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,600
last year i joined critical and for some

165
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,120
reason they decided that i could be a

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
software engineer

167
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,759
i still don't understand why i don't

168
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,639
code

169
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,560
and even after passing my one year

170
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
anniversary this week

171
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
i still don't get it um that being said

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
they're a really great company and i'm

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,960
grateful

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,160
that they took me on kept me on

175
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,479
and still have faith in me because lord

176
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,680
knows i don't

177
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,479
um a quick note before we get into the

178
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,919
real me of this talk

179
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,240
i'm not a psychological professional

180
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,280
i've never received

181
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
any professional training in

182
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,759
psychological or psychiatric treatment

183
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,360
it's also worth bearing in mind that

184
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,080
what works for me might not work for you

185
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,360
and what works for you might not work

186
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,000
for me everyone's individual and we all

187
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,919
deal with things in our own individual

188
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,639
ways

189
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,840
for me i avoid things um what's

190
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
discussed and suggested in this talk

191
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,039
comes from studies into imposter

192
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,639
syndrome done by people

193
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,280
who are definitely people who would be

194
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,360
called psychological professionals

195
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,039
and uh have been shown

196
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,520
the things discussed have been shown to

197
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,199
have some impact on the experience had

198
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,360
i also want to say if any content in

199
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,319
this talk

200
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,160
strikes a nerve i'd really recommend

201
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,599
trying to seek out a mental health

202
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,840
professional if you can

203
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,560
um i know it's hard right now with the

204
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,400
isolation and quarantine but

205
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,039
if you can talk to someone it will

206
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,240
probably help

207
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,319
especially if they have any idea of how

208
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,759
to help

209
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,599
um so sound off in the chat

210
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,759
if you've ever thought something like

211
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,840
this about a job or opportunity you've

212
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,080
had

213
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,879
i just realized i can't see the chat

214
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,479
um but anyway yeah me too

215
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,039
um these statements are all part of one

216
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,560
of the main studies into imposter

217
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,759
syndrome

218
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,160
and are considered common sentiments

219
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,120
among people

220
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,240
who experience it

221
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,199
but just what is imposter syndrome

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,800
imposter syndrome is known by

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
many names including the imposter

224
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
phenomenon imposterism

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
fraud syndrome or the imposter

226
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,319
experience

227
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,560
it isn't recognized as a psychological

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,280
disorder in dsm-5

229
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
but is instead characterized as an

230
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
experience that features feelings of

231
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,479
self-doubt

232
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,519
and of being a fraud this feeling

233
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,760
often persists even with external

234
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,799
evidence to the contrary

235
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,958
a person experiencing imposter syndrome

236
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,159
may feel as though

237
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,680
they don't deserve what they have

238
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
achieved and will often consider any

239
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,560
success they have to be the result

240
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,800
of luck or deception the phenomenon was

241
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,640
first recorded by doctors

242
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,240
pauline r clance and dr suzanne a imes

243
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
in 1978. their research primarily

244
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,279
focused on women

245
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,920
but more recent research has realized

246
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,519
that there isn't a gender bias with

247
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
imposter syndrome

248
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,680
um current research also suggests that

249
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,959
it is uh

250
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,880
often a reaction to stimuli and events

251
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,240
and it's also estimated that around 70

252
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
of individuals will experience imposter

253
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,720
syndrome at least once in their lives

254
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
the trigger for it to occur can often be

255
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
a new setting whether that's

256
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
academic or professional and it's

257
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
because of this

258
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,360
that it's really common among students

259
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
imposter syndrome is often accompanied

260
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,519
with traits of anxiety and depression

261
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,200
such as guilt fear feelings of self

262
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
uh doubts of yourself self-worth you

263
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,120
know

264
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,480
um in 1985 dr clance returned to her

265
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,600
research

266
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
she created a scale to measure

267
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,279
characteristics that she noted

268
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,120
defined the imposter experience

269
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
while there are six characteristics to

270
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,360
find clants also noted

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,800
that really only two out of six need to

272
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,320
be present for a person to be considered

273
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,720
with

274
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,200
imposter syndrome because as i said

275
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,360
before everyone's individual

276
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
and the characteristics may vary between

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,680
people

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
the most important aspect of this is the

279
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,440
impostor cycle and we'll

280
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,279
circle back to that in a second um

281
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,279
many of the people that clan studied had

282
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
an underlying need to feel special or to

283
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,839
be

284
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,440
the best they were competitive

285
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,760
and sought purpose in their lives and

286
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,800
not just as

287
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,839
a cashier at kfc i've been there on that

288
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,440
um

289
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
they also sometimes displayed

290
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,040
characteristics of being a superman or a

291
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,079
superwoman

292
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,360
not like the comic characters but more

293
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,800
along the lines of the key defining

294
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
characteristics being

295
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,320
integrity and strength that

296
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,040
they have so few weaknesses they may

297
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,360
well

298
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,560
not exist on this planet many also

299
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
exhibited a fear of failure and

300
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,040
hi that's that's me i i'm scared

301
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,519
um and several denied their own

302
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,320
abilities and discounted any praise

303
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,079
they would get even if they sought the

304
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,079
praise out

305
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,399
and finally many felt fear or guilt

306
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,160
surrounding either their own successes

307
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,839
or the concept of success

308
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,160
altogether whatever they had achieved

309
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,360
wasn't enough

310
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
and the next opportunity for success is

311
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,399
only another chance to fail

312
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,880
clance also stated in her research that

313
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,839
the imposter

314
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,000
scale should be used to determine if the

315
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
characteristics of three categories of

316
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,839
fear are present

317
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,399
a fear of evaluation a fear of not being

318
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,360
able to continue the success

319
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,440
that they've already experienced and the

320
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
fear of not being as capable

321
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,639
as others around them so

322
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,079
this is the imposter scale that i

323
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,680
mentioned earlier

324
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,440
when a person is suffering with imposter

325
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
syndrome and they're given an

326
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,639
achievement related task

327
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,720
they may start out feeling

328
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,240
feeling anxiety self-doubt worry

329
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,720
regarding the task when they settle down

330
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,600
to do the task

331
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,680
they may go one of two ways either over

332
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,959
preparing or procrastinating

333
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,959
um for me i do bits of both

334
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,000
and quite often when i over prepare i

335
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,440
explain this at work as

336
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,160
rabbit holing because i i feel like i'm

337
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,760
deep diving down a rabbit hole when i do

338
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,399
it

339
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,560
um when the task is completed they'll

340
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,079
feel

341
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,480
a feeling of relief upon the

342
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
accomplishment of completion

343
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
but when they're given positive feedback

344
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,480
and

345
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
they'll discount it in either one of two

346
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
ways depending on which route they took

347
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
with the task

348
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,839
if they over prepare for the task

349
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,200
they'll see

350
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,760
the resulting product to be

351
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,079
due to the effort and hard work they put

352
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,639
in and therefore not worthy of praise

353
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,200
and if they procrastinated they'll think

354
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,320
that it was all just

355
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,560
luck and even less worthy of the praise

356
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
they're receiving

357
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,720
and by discounting the positive feedback

358
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,959
the perceived fraudulence increases the

359
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,880
self-doubt increases

360
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,399
the person may feel depression anxiety

361
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,600
guilt and the cycle continues

362
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,399
there is the only way to stop this cycle

363
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,680
and essentially stop

364
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,880
feeding imposter syndrome is to break it

365
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,639
but how so

366
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,199
in 1975 in the original study um

367
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,240
constant ims realized that therapy was

368
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,199
the answer

369
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,399
and specifically group therapy

370
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,360
with cognitive behavioral therapy as the

371
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
main strategy

372
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,800
they theorized that this was because

373
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,639
it helped people experiencing imposter

374
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,079
syndrome realize

375
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,199
they're not alone and

376
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,639
while they were doing the therapy

377
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,040
they would also be given homework tasks

378
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
to go through

379
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,079
uh while doing so so

380
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,360
they could for example be asked to

381
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,360
to um sorry

382
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,279
to give a list of all of the people they

383
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,720
felt they had defrauded

384
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,440
in their past or list all of the

385
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,560
positive for

386
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
feedback they were given between

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,839
sessions and

388
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,480
explain in the group the next session

389
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,320
why they thought that was negative

390
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,760
what made them discount it why why they

391
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
didn't believe that to believe it and

392
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
the ultimate goal of the group therapy

393
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,800
was to

394
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
essentially start challenging the

395
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
negative thoughts that imposter syndrome

396
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,240
was giving them

397
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,120
and reframe them to positive ideas so

398
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,240
for example

399
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,959
i will fail this exam becomes i'm going

400
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,000
to study hard

401
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,040
so i can pass this exam

402
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,639
and um for the people who may be

403
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,000
wondering how they can do it without

404
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,639
therapy

405
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,079
for whatever reason whether it's they

406
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,920
don't trust therapists hi

407
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,040
or whether it's um

408
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,759
that they can't access therapy for

409
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
whatever reason

410
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,800
and one thing that i do when i'm

411
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,040
in a better mindset to kind of challenge

412
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,399
imposter syndrome

413
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,920
is i smile when i'm given the

414
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,560
feedback i nod and i say thank you at

415
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,160
the same time

416
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,959
uh this kind of ties into a really basic

417
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,720
social engineering thing that i heard

418
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,839
about

419
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,320
somewhere it wasn't even within infosec

420
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
twitter or anything i just

421
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
heard it somewhere and it makes sense

422
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,079
and it's a psychological trick

423
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,440
when you nod because

424
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
it makes you agree and it makes the

425
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,880
other person agree so it's a

426
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,639
subconscious agreement

427
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
with the compliment um

428
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
and i realize now i've probably really

429
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,040
rushed through this because it doesn't

430
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,800
feel like 25 minutes and i'm not looking

431
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,000
at my phone to check the time because

432
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,839
i'm gonna get distracted

433
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,759
um i just want to finish up with this

434
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,920
quote from maisie williams during her

435
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,199
ted talk

436
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,639
uh last year so trust that you are good

437
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,759
enough

438
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,600
if there's one thing that i've learned

439
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
is that there truly is

440
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
a place for everyone and i also did

441
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,079
compile a bit of

442
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,560
further reading if anyone wants it so

443
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,680
it's links to the

444
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,399
actual studies i looked at and maisie

445
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,839
williams talk because i think it's

446
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,360
really good

447
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,800
um and yeah if there's any questions

448
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,319
hi everyone we'll just check the string

449
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,919
now to see if there is any questions

450
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,199
um just while people are

451
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,640
kind of i guess gathering their thoughts

452
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,319
to ask any um

453
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,319
what would you say are like the top

454
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,359
three things

455
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,679
uh bit of advice that you would give to

456
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,559
someone who

457
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,199
may be feeling like this at the moment

458
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,520
um

459
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,819
that's a good question actually or even

460
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,840
[Laughter]

461
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,039
one

462
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,799
instead of dismissing a compliment

463
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,240
and this is something that i used to say

464
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,000
to a friend with uh

465
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160
self-image issues instead of dismissing

466
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,440
a compliment

467
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,679
thank the person because it's coming

468
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,640
from a good place

469
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,760
even if you don't believe it and like

470
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,960
openly dismissing the compliments can be

471
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,559
very rude and

472
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,760
yeah it's just rude and um

473
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,600
also i'd say ask yourself why

474
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,120
you don't believe the feedback as well

475
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,280
um what about it is telling you

476
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,160
that they're lying or you don't deserve

477
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,440
it

478
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,559
um and i can't

479
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,600
really think of a third um

480
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,919
that may be learning would you say that

481
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,679
body language is a big part of it as

482
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,000
well

483
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,799
learning that or maybe being able to

484
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,120
decipher that correctly

485
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,480
i don't know because

486
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,559
it's more of an internal struggle than

487
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,600
it is

488
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,559
an external one so being able to

489
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,000
understand other people's body language

490
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
is great if you struggle socially

491
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,480
but i wouldn't necessarily say it's

492
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
going to help a huge amount with

493
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,520
imposter syndrome because it's to put it

494
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,240
bluntly

495
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,600
it's all in your noggin yeah yeah i have

496
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,039
got a question here it says

497
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,080
um how do you accept praise when you do

498
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,600
something that is expectable of you

499
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,960
um exactly like i said uh

500
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,120
smile nod and say thank you and

501
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
if you're looking to go beyond the

502
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,039
expected ask

503
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,120
if there's anything that you could work

504
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,039
on to improve the next time

505
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,640
uh the person might not be able to think

506
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
of anything on this spot

507
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,679
but it's um it's a good question to ask

508
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,039
i usually ask it

509
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,720
at interviews when i've not gotten the

510
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,840
job um

511
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,200
so that's kind of what i would say

512
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,679
just thank the person kind of try and

513
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,600
trick your brain into accepting it

514
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,280
even if it's just what's expected and

515
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
you haven't gone beyond

516
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
yeah i can imagine job interviews must

517
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,240
be particularly hard at times

518
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,720
and going through that whole process oh

519
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,440
yeah

520
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
it's uh i remember

521
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,840
absec bloke um i'd applied for a job at

522
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,080
his and

523
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,799
the only thing that saved my cv from the

524
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,000
trash bin

525
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
was uh that mike knew me

526
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,200
and knew i was underselling myself in my

527
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,799
cv trying to

528
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,720
do something like a cv like an interview

529
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,400
is really hard when you have no faith in

530
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,520
yourself

531
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,880
um so we've got another question here

532
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,120
um do you think this high rate is a

533
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,039
reason why the infosec community is

534
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,640
uh so it has so much love around

535
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
yeah um one thing i do know is i do have

536
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,360
quite a lot of friends

537
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,600
who have issues with their mental health

538
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
in one way or another

539
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,240
and it does tend to be that people who

540
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,559
are

541
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,400
like really struggling will spread love

542
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,200
around to everyone else because they

543
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,559
don't want anyone else to feel the way

544
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,159
they're feeling

545
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,240
um and there is also a high prevalence

546
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
of imposter syndrome in

547
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,720
infosec specifically as well and i'm

548
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,360
thinking it's possibly the kind of like

549
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
the superman characteristics the uh

550
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,200
need to be the best to be special that

551
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,159
kind of

552
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,600
segment of the imposter scale um

553
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
but i'm not as i said i'm not a

554
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,120
psychological professional i'm not going

555
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,840
to assume anything

556
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,200
that's brilliant to see if there's any

557
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
more um

558
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,880
we are actually okay for time so

559
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,640
i don't think there are any questions

560
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
anyone else got any other questions from

561
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,799
the stream

562
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,400
going once going twice

563
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,799
i don't have a hammer to swing from

564
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,440
discord

565
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,280
uh when when did you first become aware

566
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,799
of experiencing imposter syndrome

567
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,240
i don't actually know i think it's

568
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,360
um my parents are both very intelligent

569
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,039
people and

570
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,520
without trying to toot my own horn i'm

571
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,919
also fairly intelligent

572
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,960
or at least i get told that um

573
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,760
and quite often i do get people

574
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,679
i do think that a lot of it is to do

575
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,200
with kind of like my dad had great

576
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,799
expectations for me to kind of follow in

577
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,200
his footsteps academically

578
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,240
and it like i said in some of my opening

579
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,039
sites i

580
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,919
think it stems from there but i only

581
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,600
really became aware of it when i first

582
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
started seeing infosec people talking

583
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
about imposter syndrome

584
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,880
and i was like yeah that sounds like me

585
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,720
um but other than that i don't

586
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,200
really have much memory of recognizing

587
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,640
it in myself i just

588
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,720
didn't like myself for a very long time

589
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,320
i think there's a nugget of truth also

590
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,919
like then we know the more you realize

591
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,640
you don't know yeah

592
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,440
definitely in this industry yeah there's

593
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,120
so much of this industry which is one of

594
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,280
the things that drew me to it

595
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,280
i sorry well not everybody knows

596
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,760
everything

597
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,919
and yeah understanding that what you

598
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,360
don't know is fine it's

599
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,880
everyone has a subject here that's why

600
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,039
there's three tracks today not every

601
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,640
red blue purple every call of the

602
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
rainbow that they can certainly have an

603
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,840
interest

604
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,240
yeah i think that was one of the best

605
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,080
one of the best pieces of advice i got

606
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,280
from jay from manchester gray hats

607
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,919
is that no one knows everything and no

608
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,840
one can know everything

609
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,480
um i seem to recall when he gave me that

610
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:32,960
advice

611
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,039
my my response was well i'm gonna be the

612
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,000
first

613
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,200
um because i am a bit of an overachiever

614
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,240
normally

615
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,039
um but it's a it was a very good piece

616
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,799
of advice and it's really helped me keep

617
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,440
grounded when i get confused for example

618
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,200
like when we're in voice calls and

619
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
you and cyber viking are discussing

620
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,640
um are discussing things that

621
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,679
like with red teaming technology

622
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,000
yeah well technology generally i know

623
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,840
nothing

624
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
um
