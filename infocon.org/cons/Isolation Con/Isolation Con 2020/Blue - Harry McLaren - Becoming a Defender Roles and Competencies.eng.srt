over to the one and only harry mclaren

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
thanks steve thanks everyone for having

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
me everyone that's involved in the setup

24
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,759
it's been very smooth brilliant so far

25
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,119
some great speakers

26
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,880
so i'm going to be running through a

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
session for you today called becoming a

28
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,440
defender

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
going to be focusing very much on um

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
entering into a blue team or teams

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,879
and types of roles you can expect within

32
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,239
some of those teams the kind of

33
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
competencies that are relevant to them

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
so i think it's going to be appropriate

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,120
if you're getting into the industry you

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
want to get into it but also if you're

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,319
looking to advance your career or think

38
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,599
about what's next hopefully there'll be

39
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,040
some good content for you

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
for you too so this is a little bit

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
about me

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
i'm a product leader at dharma and i

43
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,519
look a look after detection and response

44
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,879
so that's all of our services and

45
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,400
products in that area

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
i'm an alumnus of edinburgh and april

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
university so where i started and where

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,519
my main passion for

49
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,319
cyber security started the co-founder

50
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
along with stu of cyber scotland connect

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,360
um a great scotland-based community for

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,920
cyber

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
security and information security

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,599
professionals practitioners

55
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
um and you can see me on twitter it's

56
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,720
cyber harry boo

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,159
i've listed my previous roles just kind

58
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,360
of give you an understanding that we

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,959
have pretty much always been in the blue

60
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,239
team space

61
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,560
um first of all working in security

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,000
operation centers

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,560
and instant investigation later on more

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,080
security engineering so building the

65
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,519
tools that defenders use

66
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
to defend their networks and respond to

67
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,599
active cyber threats

68
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,360
i've then consulted across mostly large

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,840
and very large enterprises of building

70
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,680
and enhancing their security operations

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
capabilities

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,519
and now i focus on product development

73
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,720
um in the same area

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
for a dharma so what we're going to be

75
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
covering

76
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,599
shouldn't be more than 40 minutes give

77
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,080
or take keep trying to keep on schedule

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
i'm going to first cover just a couple

79
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
of slides on why it's why it's still

80
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,040
really important defensive cyber

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
security why

82
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
blue teams are still very relevant still

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
very important

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,159
talk a little bit about what security

85
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,360
operations centres are what their

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,000
purposes

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,319
what component parts within them a

88
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,680
little bit about the types of careers

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,879
you can see in security operation

90
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,519
centers

91
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,720
and then i'm going to focus on the

92
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
competencies the competencies that

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,599
defenders need

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,760
to be successful and hopefully have a

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,480
big impact on the industry

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,519
so first and foremost um two two stats

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,080
from

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,760
i think i collated them from three or

99
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,599
four reports over

100
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,720
to 2019 and these were just two

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
of many but two of the largest as far as

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
financial impact of the importance

103
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
to sorry to highlight the importance of

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
subsequent professionals so

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
uh bec business email compromise um

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,479
things like you know phishing emails and

107
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,400
people being tricked fundamentally into

108
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,919
doing things that

109
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,479
yeah it's like uh transferring money

110
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,000
changing payroll details

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,560
this is roughly 1.7 billion a year but

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
it's dwarfed by

113
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,080
by its uh bigger brother ransomware and

114
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,000
so it's been around for quite some time

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,759
but it's just been growing at an

116
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,040
incredible rate

117
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,520
everything from uh not bad here which

118
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
wasn't true ransomware but

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
still kind of counts in this category

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,479
through to the um

121
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,560
you know weaponized and commercialized

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
platforms now that cyber criminals use

123
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
to spread around somewhere throughout

124
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,400
the world so you know just with those

125
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
two combined you're talking about nine

126
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
billion a year of financial impact

127
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,600
so um yeah being on the defensive side

128
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,520
of the world is not going away anytime

129
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,560
soon it's a very

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,479
very valid career and can be very

131
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,000
rewarding when you think about the

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,520
impact that these kind of numbers could

133
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,560
have on businesses

134
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
this is also recognized by their world

135
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,919
economic forum so they

136
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,560
yearly publish a fantastic survey on

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:30,960
risk

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
now risk isn't the coolest thing in the

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
world but it is quite interesting when

140
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,680
you think about it

141
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,000
in relation to cyber security so this is

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
the top right hand

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,919
quadrant this is where they believe that

144
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,960
some of the most

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,199
impactful and if you look at the access

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,280
itse yeah impact and likelihood so this

147
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
is some of the most

148
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,639
worrisome things that businesses should

149
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,759
be worried about

150
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,199
and you'll notice there that cyber

151
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,120
attacks is right up there along things

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,080
like human made

153
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
environmental disasters natural

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
disasters biodiversity loss weather

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,800
crisis

156
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,080
so this is this is not something that um

157
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,639
boards are you know forgetting about

158
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,319
these days it's starting to become

159
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,160
more and more prominent it's up there on

160
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
the risk register for all major

161
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,319
companies

162
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,759
and it's impacting them and making

163
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,240
businesses go out of business

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,759
so yeah so here we are in the likelihood

165
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
we've got data fraud and theft and cyber

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
attacks at six and seven

167
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,639
and in impact uh six and eight so

168
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,440
if you're thinking from a you know a

169
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
board shareholders perspective

170
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,600
these things are absolutely critical and

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,880
on the top of their list of things to

172
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,720
worry about therefore it's really

173
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,840
important that there are

174
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
well-trained and competent people in the

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,880
profession

176
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,160
that can help them respond to these

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
things appropriately

178
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
so let's talk about what sock is now i'm

179
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,319
going to use the word sock to mean

180
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,800
security operation center and i'm gonna

181
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
essentially use it as a synonym for

182
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,479
security operations full stop so not

183
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,000
everyone has a sock

184
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
but they'll usually have someone

185
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
responsible for the types of roles and

186
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,199
responsibilities that assault does have

187
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,039
so that might just be one person

188
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,800
might be outsourced but i'm going to

189
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,479
kind of refer to all of that right now

190
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,199
as sock

191
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,000
and as it's my background so what was

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
the stock well

193
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
fundamentally a sock is to prepare for

194
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,319
detect and respond to cyber security

195
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,280
threats

196
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,599
so preparation is making sure that

197
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,720
you've established

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,479
people processes and technology to

199
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,880
support the two main things you do which

200
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,720
is to detect and respond

201
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,639
so that preparation is key because you

202
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,240
don't want to be preparing

203
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,479
um while doing so you don't want to be

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,520
preparing or

205
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
responding in a way when something's

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,199
kicked off you need to do that before

207
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,960
the band before it's actually occurred

208
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,199
as

209
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,400
best you can detection it's all about

210
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,240
proactive monitoring so making sure that

211
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,360
you understand when you're being

212
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
attacked

213
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,840
if you've listened to any of the other

214
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,599
talks today or indeed

215
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,879
you know read anything about cyber

216
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,800
security you'll know that um prevention

217
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,280
you know protection uh is never gonna

218
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,000
work 100

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,360
of the time there are always going to be

220
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
threat actors whether they're internal

221
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,759
or external

222
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,199
that can get through your defenses

223
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,120
whether they're layered whether they're

224
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,680
next-gen and supported by ml and ai

225
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,560
doesn't matter

226
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,400
there's no such thing as 100 security

227
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,080
in protection so you have to have

228
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,759
capabilities to detect

229
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,479
and then respond to those incidents so

230
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,039
detection is about proactive monitoring

231
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,680
and then triaging and understanding well

232
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,599
is this threat or this activity

233
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,280
worse than the what than another one

234
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,879
that's happening at the same time where

235
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,400
should i be focusing my time and my

236
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,520
resources

237
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,160
response is then how to then respond to

238
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
what you detected

239
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,599
so you think that you know you a

240
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,640
phishing email has

241
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
hit the inbox of everyone in your

242
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,000
executive committee

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
okay what do you do about it and this is

244
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,240
again without preparations is critical

245
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
so that you have playbooks and

246
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,799
procedures in place

247
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,040
so that for all of the expected types of

248
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
incidents that you might

249
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,200
come across you have prescribed and

250
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
um thought out what exactly you should

251
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,920
do you know who should you contact in it

252
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,200
to get them to shut down

253
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
um your exchange server who should you

254
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,480
contact

255
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,200
to you know revoke some of your api keys

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
in your aws cloud

257
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
because they're being abused um by you

258
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
know a ransomware bot

259
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
um and so there they're the key main

260
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,959
pillars it's detection response and

261
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,480
wrapped around that is preparation

262
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,839
that is what security operations is

263
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,600
fundamentally about at least from my

264
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,080
perspective

265
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
so what are the typical types of roles

266
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,519
that you would see within a sock

267
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,519
so these are ones that i've personally

268
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,440
experienced and how when when i've when

269
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
i've built socks that we've typically

270
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
framed them in these in these tiers so

271
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,720
in the first tier

272
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
um often describes tier one sometimes a

273
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
mixture of tier one and two

274
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,720
your your entry role is often a support

275
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,560
analyst this could be

276
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,399
considered almost kind of like a help

277
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,920
desk type role

278
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,200
they're typically doing things like

279
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
password resets or you know responding

280
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,640
to the most basic

281
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,760
of um alerts or inquiries within

282
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,360
security

283
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
the the next role also sometimes an

284
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
entry role is a security analyst so at

285
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
this point at that tier one they're

286
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,200
often

287
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
triaging um large volumes of alerts

288
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,959
or potential security incidents and

289
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,000
they're trying to just work

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
out at that first tier is this a true

291
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
positive is this something i'm worried

292
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,079
about

293
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,680
and if it is something i'm worried about

294
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
how worried should i be

295
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
so that is then likely to then be sent

296
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
to a second tier or escalated

297
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,120
to some form of instant management

298
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,000
function depending upon their analysis

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
that's often then augmented with a

300
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,160
senior analyst or scene security analyst

301
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
and they'll often you know you might

302
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
have say a two or three

303
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
to one mapping there so you might have a

304
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,680
senior analyst sit above or with a team

305
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,279
of other security analysts just to

306
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,360
provide that additional experience

307
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,200
and guidance on the more complicated

308
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,160
tickets or issues or alerts

309
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,399
in that second to third tier this is

310
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,519
where you're often starting to see

311
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
people specialize more so you might have

312
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
a person that's specifically

313
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
responsible for supporting incidents or

314
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,839
to be an incident investigator so they

315
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,959
don't react

316
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,560
to normal tickets coming through the

317
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,320
system but they get pulled in for

318
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,880
specific

319
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
incident triage so when there is a

320
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
security incident how

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
bad is it what's the impact how do we

322
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,079
contain it and recover from that

323
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,680
security incident

324
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,120
you've then got threat hunters these are

325
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,959
people that proactively

326
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,560
don't wait for an alert saying they've

327
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,720
been attacked but they go and hunt

328
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,160
throughout the environment throughout

329
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,839
the logs and the metrics that are being

330
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,640
collected

331
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,000
to try and actually uncover um evidence

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,480
of an attack or evidence of an attacker

333
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
you know trying to collate information

334
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,920
about your organization

335
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,839
and then they try and feed into a loop

336
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,200
of development which is then to

337
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,640
proactively create

338
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
detective and responsive controls so

339
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,640
that these new techniques

340
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
techniques and tactics can be identified

341
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,079
early

342
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,519
and hopefully you can then mitigate

343
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,680
those threats you've then got this role

344
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
called sock specialist these aren't

345
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
um in every sock but in the socks that

346
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,120
i've worked in

347
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,360
this is often somebody who's uh um a

348
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,959
true sme in particular

349
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,079
one or more or a few areas so we might

350
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:54,800
have

351
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
a big data specialist so for us that

352
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,920
would be splunk

353
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,120
or you might have a specialist

354
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,279
specifically in vulnerability management

355
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,800
and if that responsibility sits within

356
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,639
the sock that person will often have

357
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,040
been an analyst or instant investigator

358
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
but has then become a true sme in that

359
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,279
technology and is then responsible for

360
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,720
it within the sock

361
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,639
so it's often an interesting role and

362
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,800
interesting place to kind of evolve into

363
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
if you've had a very particular interest

364
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
so it might be in

365
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
a suite of technologies like it might be

366
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720
you'd become a bit of a cisco specialist

367
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,079
because you've become an expert in their

368
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,560
firewalls and their ids ips their

369
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
casbi and other tooling and then at the

370
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,200
management tier this is where you start

371
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,959
to see roles like shift leader they're

372
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,200
often not particularly technical but are

373
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,240
there more of a

374
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,200
um supervisory role and socks often run

375
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,760
in a 24x7 configuration so they're there

376
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,320
to

377
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,160
feed and water the people side make sure

378
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,760
that people arrive on time

379
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,639
that they're doing their

380
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,079
responsibilities correctly that they

381
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,399
have the right workload and then you've

382
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,040
got

383
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,399
more specialisms like incident

384
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,320
management so this is typically a person

385
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,959
who's

386
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,560
responsible when an incident does get

387
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,880
kicked off in ensuring that all of the

388
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,279
right steps are taken to mitigate that

389
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,399
incident and respond to it in a

390
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,120
pre-programmed and procedural driven way

391
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,720
and then finally often you have a sock

392
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,399
manager or service manager

393
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,120
and they sit above all of these roles

394
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,639
and they face off to the business so

395
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,440
they will own

396
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,079
things like service level agreements or

397
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:20,959
okrs

398
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,600
um which are objectives and key results

399
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,320
you know they'll

400
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,120
they might hold the targets and they'll

401
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,399
be responsible for

402
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,800
you know perhaps promotions training

403
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,399
budgets making sure everything fits

404
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,519
together correctly

405
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,800
that you have the right number of

406
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,440
security analysts to threat hunters

407
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
that new technology coming into the

408
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,120
stock isn't going to overwhelm

409
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,680
uh you know your tier ones or tier twos

410
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,800
and they'll also be

411
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,959
usually responsible for pushing through

412
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,600
programs of change to drive efficiencies

413
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,920
within the sock or to you know enhance

414
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,360
their capabilities perhaps

415
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,199
so i'm not going to cover the

416
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,639
responsibilities of all those roles

417
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,120
because of

418
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,560
the time constraints but i'm going to

419
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
focus on that tier one and two so these

420
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,199
are some of the most common

421
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,120
responsibilities you find

422
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
in that tier one and two levels so this

423
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,560
is typically for your your analyst or

424
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,160
senior analyst roles

425
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,639
um but not necessarily exclusively so as

426
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,320
i mentioned so that fundamental security

427
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,079
monitoring and event triage

428
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,800
that is you know being reactive to an

429
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,120
event of interest comes into the sock

430
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
you know someone this account has failed

431
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
to log in three times

432
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,639
is that a bad thing and they're there to

433
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,160
go well actually that's a service

434
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,680
account it does that

435
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,839
on the 30th of every month because of a

436
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,760
script that we can't seem to get them to

437
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,320
update

438
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,880
it's fine don't worry about it or no

439
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,000
that's happening across

440
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
all of our database servers that's not

441
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,839
normal so the triage and step then is

442
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,639
going to be that

443
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,920
escalation and that's the next

444
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,480
responsibility so instant escalation and

445
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,519
instant support

446
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,880
is to make sure that the incident

447
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
management team and the specialists then

448
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,079
jump on the right things

449
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,079
so at that top level tier that those

450
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,360
specialists have very

451
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,839
you know they're often quite rare within

452
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,760
the business they're expensive

453
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
as far as salary so you're not going to

454
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
have many of them but their their skill

455
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,720
set needs to be

456
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,079
pointed in the right direction and

457
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,160
that's often the responsibility or

458
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,199
co-responsibility of the analysts

459
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,959
supporting service transitions so as new

460
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,800
services come into the software security

461
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,760
operations team

462
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,279
they need to you know be able to help

463
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,199
the project help the team move that in

464
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,560
so it becomes part of their business as

465
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,079
usual operation

466
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,920
and then continually improvement so that

467
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,360
covers the full people process

468
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,560
technology

469
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,680
they should always be looking

470
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,079
iteratively to improve upon their job

471
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,759
role and that that goes for all the

472
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,959
roles within a sock

473
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,560
you always want to be looking at how you

474
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,240
can drive improvements

475
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
to the processes to the people

476
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,000
themselves their training how they

477
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
you know on boarded and the technology

478
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,839
is the technology tuned is it up to date

479
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
is it doing its job correctly

480
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,279
and then finally they often support

481
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,880
management reporting so pulling

482
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,519
reports out of jira servicenow splunk

483
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,160
whatever

484
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,839
and actually reporting that up so that

485
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,600
it can be combined into a pack for

486
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
management so that might be

487
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,120
number of events per second will be

488
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
processed number of tickets that we hit

489
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,920
our 20-minute sla on how many incidents

490
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,440
did we support

491
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,279
um you know how many data sources are in

492
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,519
scope what's our coverage gap for our

493
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,320
tooling

494
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
and it really could be so many different

495
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,759
things it very much depends soft to

496
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,759
shock

497
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,440
okay and so now getting into the meat of

498
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,720
it we're not going to talk a bit about

499
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,759
competencies

500
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,519
and or skills i call them competencies

501
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,199
it's what we call them adama

502
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,959
and we've recently gone through a big

503
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,320
body of change to

504
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,279
really think about how we look at job

505
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,800
roles and how we bring people into the

506
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,600
business so

507
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,120
some of these slides are built on that

508
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,880
kind of six months of work that we did

509
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,000
that i was also involved

510
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,199
in and supported and these are very much

511
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:39,759
from

512
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,279
my perspective and from some of the

513
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,040
people within a dharma perspective it's

514
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,800
not an exhaustive list

515
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
nor is it a checklist you shouldn't feel

516
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,680
that all of these things have to be

517
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,720
achieved for you to

518
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,120
get an entry position or go up to the

519
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,079
next rut

520
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,680
they're there to try and give guidelines

521
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,240
and give um something for people to

522
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,639
consume when they're thinking about well

523
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,000
where are my gaps

524
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,120
where are my competency gaps now

525
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,520
we split them into two key areas and one

526
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
is technical

527
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
um which should be relatively

528
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,079
straightforward to explain what that

529
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,799
means

530
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,559
uh the second is behavioral which i'll

531
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,480
get to after but behavioral competencies

532
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
are what we've introduced and it was

533
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,959
attempting to distill down what key

534
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,240
behaviors or

535
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,559
in some respects soft skills uh which

536
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,000
isn't the best word for them which is

537
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,199
why we chose behavioral

538
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,400
do we look for in people that we hire um

539
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
and as you know 90 of people that work

540
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,000
with us are defenders

541
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,919
it's very relevant obviously to the the

542
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,440
roles and responsibilities i've just

543
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,720
mentioned

544
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
so some of the technical competencies i

545
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,520
don't think you're going to find

546
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,880
anything here that you don't necessarily

547
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,679
already know

548
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
but you know they're they're here for

549
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,799
you to

550
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
review and maybe consider if you don't

551
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,760
have some of these if you might want to

552
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,280
look into getting them depending on your

553
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,080
type of

554
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,320
career choices or specialisms we've got

555
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,280
the fundamentals which are networking

556
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,480
if you're sitting in a security

557
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,559
operations center and you start to see

558
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,000
alerts coming from networking

559
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,799
equipment whether that's a waff whether

560
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,840
that is your

561
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,240
routing and switching infrastructure or

562
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,520
you know your firewalls your proxies

563
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,559
your vpns

564
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,000
and you start to see subnetting

565
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,520
information but don't know what subnet

566
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,720
is or you don't know

567
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
how to go and use a subnet calculator

568
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,080
because you know if you're

569
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,520
not networking admin you may not be able

570
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,280
to do that in your head you know there's

571
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,120
going to be challenges in how successful

572
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,640
you're likely to be in triaging those

573
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,400
types of incidents you have to have that

574
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,039
underlying knowledge of the basics of

575
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,080
the tcp

576
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,600
networking stack for example to

577
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
understand the handoffs between each

578
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,160
layer

579
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
from the application down to the actual

580
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,160
physical network you don't need to be an

581
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
expert but you do have to have a handle

582
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
on it and the same goes for endpoint

583
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,080
you know i'm a predominantly windows and

584
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,280
mac os user

585
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,840
i have implemented and managed linux

586
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,679
lots really in the server space

587
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,919
never used it as a desktop system i've

588
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,360
played along with a lot of virtualized

589
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,880
and physical systems and dabbled in

590
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,320
containerization

591
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,120
but that breadth of of experience really

592
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,160
helps me when

593
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,360
if i get an alert saying that um

594
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,840
there's a i know let's say a kerberos a

595
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,039
vulnerability

596
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,720
on an end point and i actually go and re

597
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
look up that vulnerability and it says

598
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,720
it only applies to windows servers

599
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
but the endpoints the linux box that

600
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
instantly helps me triage and go

601
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,720
that is likely to be a false positive

602
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,960
it's unlikely that that linux box has

603
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,640
a windows vulnerability in its

604
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
implementation of kerberos

605
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,559
so that's why it's important to have

606
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,919
understanding of endpoints and that

607
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,679
extends to mobile as well

608
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,799
um although typically you're going to

609
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,400
get a lot less alerting from your mobile

610
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,200
infrastructure

611
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
especially with byod type things and but

612
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,520
that's that's not the case

613
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,559
all the time and containerization um a

614
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,919
key area to start to

615
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,919
explore when it comes to endpoints and

616
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,679
servers because things are starting to

617
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,120
get more ethereal and just

618
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,840
running within a certain you know space

619
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,799
within like a

620
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,039
kubernetes cluster or similar and they

621
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,480
have different requirements of different

622
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
attributes than your more traditional

623
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,760
virtualized or physical infrastructure

624
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,880
that are worth paying attention to

625
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,280
malware malware is never going away any

626
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,000
time soon

627
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,919
it's existed for decades and will

628
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,120
continue to it's

629
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,400
it's good to understand the different

630
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,799
types so you know is it a worm

631
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,440
is it a polymorphic virus does it spread

632
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,080
simply

633
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,120
via a dropper via a phishing email and

634
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
then download and live off the land in

635
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,600
memory

636
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,440
and not actually download any malicious

637
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,880
binaries itself

638
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,320
what the types of patterns that we're

639
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
seeing in malware at the moment you know

640
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,960
we're seeing

641
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,600
big you know root kit zero day type

642
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,120
approaches or are we actually just

643
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,600
seeing

644
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
exploitations of powershell being poorly

645
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,559
implemented and managed via gpo

646
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,159
what the types of tools are out there

647
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,840
that we can research things like

648
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,760
virustotal are a great place to start

649
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,679
although there's an absolute

650
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,280
incredible amount of resources in the

651
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,320
virus and research space

652
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,679
honey parts fireless malar as i

653
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,799
mentioned like living off the land all

654
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,159
of these things are important to again

655
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,520
not be an expert in but have an

656
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,640
understanding of

657
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,400
so that as you start to triage the

658
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,840
events and incidents that come into your

659
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,640
system

660
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,080
that you can correctly infer behaviors

661
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,960
infer

662
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
impact you know if you have an alert for

663
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,960
something that's wormable

664
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,280
within your environment and you also

665
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,039
happen to know that you have

666
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,799
vulnerabilities or you're not patched

667
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,159
much in your windows estate

668
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,000
and you get an alert for a worm that's

669
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,280
very different to

670
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,159
getting an alert for a browser add-in on

671
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,200
one computer

672
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,799
that's just a bit of you know

673
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,320
potentially unwanted

674
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,120
program so that kind of thing's

675
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,320
important

676
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,120
um tactics and techniques this is a not

677
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,440
certainly not a new area of research but

678
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,799
it is being

679
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,360
increasingly uplifted by the kind of

680
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,840
work

681
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,120
from mitre with the attack framework

682
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,320
and the common controls from the cis

683
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,480
and in i mean a lot of this is building

684
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,080
on some of the work by lockheed martin

685
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,440
and the original

686
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
cyberattack kill chain that they

687
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,799
published all of this is really

688
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,559
important for starting to understand and

689
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,320
be in the mindset of the attacker or

690
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,440
attackers

691
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
considering that the phases they go

692
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
through when they do reconnaissance when

693
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,520
they look to build and weaponize things

694
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,280
to attack you when they actually execute

695
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,960
attacks and compromise and then move

696
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
laterally

697
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,159
and then understanding at the next level

698
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,520
down but what are the actual common

699
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,240
techniques

700
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,679
used so if an attacker has actually

701
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,880
managed to get a

702
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,799
foothold within your environment perhaps

703
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,320
in your perimeter

704
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,559
how are they likely to try and move to

705
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,000
get better privileges

706
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,159
how they likely to then try and elevate

707
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,520
those privileges

708
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,919
and take action and try and get hold of

709
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,280
your intellectual property

710
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,600
or your you know some of your key

711
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,919
databases with user information

712
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,520
when you understand those techniques you

713
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,039
can then start to understand that when

714
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,159
you uncover

715
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,159
an attack in progress or you're tracking

716
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,520
a

717
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,440
something that's post attack you can

718
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
start to follow it because you

719
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,480
understand how the attacker is likely to

720
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,440
work

721
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,720
and the research in this area is

722
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
fascinating because it's built upon

723
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,520
a community of a very broad community of

724
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,440
people within industry that are actually

725
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,400
telling them

726
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,159
well this is actually how we got

727
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,600
compromised and what we found

728
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
after doing six months of research and

729
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,080
pulling apart our logs and our pcaps is

730
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,440
that they did this and they used this

731
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,799
particular attack

732
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,559
that's fascinating well now we're going

733
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,240
to include it in our attack model

734
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,360
so that everyone who uses it can go ah

735
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,960
if you want to make sure that doesn't

736
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,799
happen to you

737
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,159
you need to do these configuration

738
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,760
changes you need to harden your controls

739
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,720
in this area

740
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,080
you also need these detective and

741
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
responsive controls in your sock to know

742
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,200
that if it happens

743
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
etcetera etcetera so an understanding of

744
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
attack

745
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,559
tactics and techniques is a really

746
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,559
beneficial thing to know as a defender

747
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,720
it really gets you in the mindset all

748
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
the way down to the tooling level

749
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
of how an attacker might actually

750
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
compromise and attack your network

751
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,679
and then finally and we'll pretty much

752
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,039
any technical discipline serve you in

753
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:49,679
good stead

754
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,559
that is some light ex programming and

755
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,240
database experience

756
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,520
i'm not meaning full-on you know um

757
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
computer science you know i'm a

758
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,559
developer type

759
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,320
thing you do not have to be developed to

760
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,760
be a good defender and work in cyber

761
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,720
security

762
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
but some like knowledge of something

763
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,320
like you know a scripting language like

764
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,919
python or go

765
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,600
again basic understanding of a pro of

766
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,360
the programming life cycle especially a

767
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,039
secure programming life cycle

768
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,360
and then the types of tooling often used

769
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,799
in say

770
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,240
continuous integration continuous

771
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,159
delivery tooling so version control

772
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,159
configuration management

773
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,840
having some light experience in all

774
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,679
these areas will only stand you in good

775
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,400
stead

776
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
either for building your own tools and

777
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,440
or scripting your own tools for

778
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,000
automation

779
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,039
for efficiency or for trying to uncover

780
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,200
weaknesses in other people's code

781
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
or application security practices and

782
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,279
database understanding so

783
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,000
sql nurseql and big data tooling again

784
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
if you can manipulate information

785
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,000
especially at scale using big data

786
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
you will be able to be a much more

787
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,520
successful analyst because you're able

788
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
to analyze big data sets

789
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
at speed rather than trying to you know

790
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,520
pull it into excel or

791
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,279
you know wrap some kind of wrangling

792
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,960
using grep if you actually understand

793
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
how to load that into a database or load

794
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,120
it into an

795
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,080
indexed mapreduce system that you can

796
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,000
then query at scale

797
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,360
you know you're likely to be

798
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,120
establishing practices that stand you in

799
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,320
much better stead than

800
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,159
constantly having to hack a solution

801
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,039
together using excel or similar

802
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,600
so there's some a very broad range of

803
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,960
technical competencies that i believe

804
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
are really important for defenders

805
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,360
as i said depending on where you want to

806
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,039
focus that you make that may not all be

807
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,440
relevant i consider them that there's a

808
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,159
foundational set if you will uh for a

809
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,760
good defender especially working in a

810
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,679
sock or sub type environment

811
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,279
and think that they you know they really

812
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,840
do help you be successful in that area

813
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,360
so the second side

814
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
behavioral competencies there's quite a

815
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,200
lot on this slide it's not that it's not

816
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,320
the most attractive

817
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,640
but we we identified eight behavioral

818
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,080
behavioral areas

819
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,039
that we wanted to you know look for in

820
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,640
our employees and look for in our

821
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,679
defenders

822
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,760
and you know depending on the role we

823
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,200
look for light

824
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,080
to an increasing level of knowledge or

825
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
skill in these areas so for an analyst

826
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,679
we don't expect them to have a huge

827
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,279
amount of business insight at that level

828
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,159
in their career

829
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,320
but we do expect them to be an engaging

830
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,440
communicator

831
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,120
because they're often dealing with you

832
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,640
know customers people within the

833
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,760
business

834
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,480
um but for a manager you know we do

835
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,760
expect them to be

836
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,960
you know an innovative thinker and

837
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,559
a collaborative partner to a higher

838
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,240
level than again we would someone

839
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,840
starting early in their career so these

840
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,520
try to articulate some of the key

841
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,960
behaviors that we look for

842
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,559
and try to nurture as well because

843
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,600
that's one of the things that's

844
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,679
important to point out especially

845
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,600
as somebody that i do a lot of hiring

846
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,960
and a lot of interviewing

847
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,360
we don't expect people and no one should

848
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,799
expect somebody to come

849
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,279
a fully formed product a fully formed

850
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,320
version of themselves

851
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
no one is we're all on our own journey

852
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,080
we're all learning by doing and we're

853
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,640
often

854
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,440
learning in response to an environment

855
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
that is incredibly hostile

856
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,679
you know we we are defenders because we

857
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,279
are being attacked

858
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,919
and it's often easy to forget that we

859
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,720
are constantly trying to push against

860
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
a load of people with almost infinite

861
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,760
resources that

862
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,840
want to undo our work they want us to

863
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,480
not be successful they want us to fail

864
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,559
every day every attack they make they

865
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,240
want us to fail at our job

866
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,919
and so we're constantly pushing back

867
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,760
against that and

868
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,200
some of these behaviors i think really

869
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,039
help instill um

870
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,960
things like learning mindset personal

871
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,559
responsibility performance through and

872
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,919
these things help

873
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,120
push us when we exhibit these behaviors

874
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,039
to push back against those attackers and

875
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,399
often succeed

876
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,840
in fending off their attacks or

877
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,520
responding to them

878
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,960
and i think that's really important um

879
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,000
so just get my 15 minute warning so i

880
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,279
will make sure to

881
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,480
care to keep the pace going um so

882
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,520
i'm not going to talk through each

883
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,880
behavioral competency i think they're

884
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,760
relatively self

885
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,480
um explanative and all these slides will

886
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,200
be shared

887
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
but i'm now going to cover one final

888
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,279
area which i i didn't mention

889
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,039
but it kind of feeds into this overall

890
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,360
picture of the behaviors and things

891
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,840
and that is emotional intelligence now

892
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,120
emotional intelligence is kind of a

893
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,200
buzzword it can often be misused

894
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,640
and it certainly shouldn't be used as a

895
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,000
i guess a a tracking tool you know to to

896
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,559
give people scores in each area and you

897
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,919
know fire people are disciplined

898
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,679
if they're not exhibiting them but i do

899
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,360
think it's a really useful

900
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,240
kind of five point system to consider

901
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,159
when thinking about yourself so one of

902
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:30,559
the

903
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,000
key things that all of this is hinged

904
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,760
upon is self-awareness so the ability to

905
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,399
actually

906
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,720
look at yourself your behaviors your

907
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,440
drivers

908
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,799
the thing your your moods your

909
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,640
motivators and

910
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,799
and assess yourself not against others

911
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,320
but against was

912
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,440
was that right did i maybe respond to my

913
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
colleague to my manager to my customer

914
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,080
because i was actually in a bad mood or

915
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,720
was i

916
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,440
right and was my motivator actually know

917
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,960
what they were suggesting was dangerous

918
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,799
and it was important for me to call them

919
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,679
out on it

920
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,760
self-awareness is a really key and

921
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,440
foundational component of all emotional

922
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,799
intelligence because without it the rest

923
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,240
kind of doesn't work

924
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
self-regulation so that when you

925
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,720
actually have some awareness and you go

926
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,440
i'm really frustrated or angry or sad

927
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,679
and you're feeling pushed to do or act

928
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,799
in a way that

929
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,039
perhaps is quite damaging to somebody

930
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,320
else or yourself

931
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,159
are you able to maybe then pull it back

932
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,440
and go

933
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,919
oh maybe i shouldn't go and shout to

934
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,799
that person

935
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,880
and for being an idiot when actually i

936
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,600
made that mistake myself six months ago

937
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,120
maybe i should just go for a walk and

938
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,559
then afterwards ask them if they need

939
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,120
some help

940
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,559
on understanding what happened you know

941
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,200
what is your what is your motivation and

942
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,039
are you able to actually

943
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,799
bring motivation to the party when

944
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,240
you're having a bad day

945
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,960
so that is not just you know trying to

946
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,000
be perfect

947
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,440
it's a frivolous um exercise to try and

948
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,240
do that

949
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,399
but actually thinking using that

950
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,480
self-awareness to go

951
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,960
i actually think i could cope with that

952
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,320
situation better

953
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,080
how can i do that you know

954
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,600
self-improvement i think is a really

955
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,799
positive thing

956
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,399
when it's not done obsessively and when

957
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,559
it's not done to the detriment of others

958
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,679
you know emotionally intelligence and

959
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,600
all these things it's not about you

960
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,320
going ah

961
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
i'm better at that than that person it's

962
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,520
going well

963
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,679
a month ago i dealt with that situation

964
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,600
very poorly because i wasn't taking care

965
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,120
of myself very well and

966
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,320
i kept you know under sleeping and i was

967
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,279
knackered

968
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,200
but i've made some improvements in the

969
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,559
last month and i responded to that

970
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,760
situation much better

971
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,200
that's great that's a really good thing

972
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,720
and you should reward yourself for doing

973
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,679
that

974
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,840
and the next one is empathy and empathy

975
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,760
is a massively overlooked thing

976
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,000
empathy is fundamentally the ability to

977
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,679
put yourself in someone else's position

978
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,880
at an emotional state and consider is

979
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,679
that why

980
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,440
they responded in that way is that why

981
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,120
they said that to me were they actually

982
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,320
really upset and

983
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,080
they were being they were being poorly

984
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,159
articulate they weren't self-regulating

985
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,240
and they weren't being self-aware

986
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,840
and then doing it to yourself as well

987
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,519
sometimes and being a bit kinder to

988
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,240
yourself

989
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,279
it's really easy to you know be really

990
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,640
hard on yourself and go you did that

991
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,200
wrong

992
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
you know even with self-awareness and

993
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,480
kind of going you should improve at that

994
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,840
your crap at that but

995
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
empathy can extend to yourself and just

996
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
be like you know what

997
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,519
i think i did okay actually because i'm

998
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,960
working really hard and i had a really

999
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
tough time and self-isolation

1000
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,679
sucks i'm going to give myself a a bit

1001
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,679
of a bit of an easy time it's okay that

1002
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,200
i didn't complete that linkedin learning

1003
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,080
course or

1004
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,919
learn a new language i'm just going to

1005
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,320
empathize and go nah

1006
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,840
it's a bit sad being indoors all the

1007
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,360
time it sucks so i'm just gonna chill

1008
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,640
out

1009
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,080
and then finally social skills and

1010
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,640
obviously these some people have

1011
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,279
natural predispositions to be to have

1012
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,799
social skills some people have

1013
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,200
learning disabilities or this or

1014
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,880
physical disabilities that make

1015
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,880
being social very difficult for them and

1016
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,919
these things should be

1017
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,159
acknowledged and awareness driven for

1018
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,240
them but for people that

1019
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,159
um don't have i guess a natural uh

1020
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,039
or biological reason it's the ability of

1021
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,480
kind of going

1022
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,360
did i respond negatively to that was

1023
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,039
that actually just a joke

1024
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,360
you know this kind of maintaining this

1025
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,399
line between

1026
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,880
things that are reasonable and okay

1027
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,399
socially to be offended about because

1028
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,679
they were offensive

1029
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,519
and things that are perhaps something

1030
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,600
that maybe i should just let go

1031
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,519
because it's actually okay and it was

1032
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,760
meant with no malice and it was actually

1033
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,200
just about building friendship and

1034
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,240
relationships so

1035
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,840
i think that's a really cool and

1036
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,320
important thing as well but anyway

1037
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,559
they're the kind of five components of

1038
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,880
emotional intelligence or they are by

1039
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,600
one uh or a collection of researchers

1040
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,399
there's different interpretations of it

1041
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,320
but we're getting close to the end now

1042
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,600
so and i do want to leave time for

1043
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,960
questions if there are any

1044
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,559
so i'm gonna now just move on to the

1045
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,720
resources section um

1046
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,960
these hyperlinks obviously don't work on

1047
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,480
your screen but the slides will be

1048
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,320
uploaded to slideshare and shared in

1049
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,120
whatever way

1050
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,600
um the isolation can't want to

1051
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,640
distribute them

1052
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,159
this is just a few that resources often

1053
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,760
share some are relevant to this talk

1054
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,320
some are

1055
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,840
relevant to other things i'm really

1056
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,919
interested in and there's

1057
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,720
tons of research and resources out there

1058
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,279
about

1059
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,840
you know skills and competencies about

1060
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,080
you know search versus courses

1061
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,320
versus experience and and fundamentally

1062
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,080
all of those things feed into being

1063
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,120
successful

1064
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,440
in your career and being a good defender

1065
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,399
and

1066
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,799
all of them have their place i don't

1067
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,080
believe any are

1068
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,919
you know rubbish i don't believe any are

1069
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,600
the only way forward

1070
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
but i do think that all of them should

1071
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,279
be weighted and if they help you get to

1072
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,640
where you're going that they should be

1073
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240
you know pursued and pursued

1074
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
you know structure and structured plan

1075
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,159
and in a way where you kind of seek help

1076
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,960
and get it from the community at large

1077
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,320
um so then finally that's the end of my

1078
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,960
talk

1079
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,039

um someone quit look up there

1105
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,079
not a great deal i mean harry your

1106
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,599
your testimonies are brilliant i really

1107
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,359
love listening to you speak and your

1108
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,040
experience is brilliant

1109
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,000
um what about the have you got any

1110
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,680
thoughts on around the idea of the

1111
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,160
the security analysis role in general

1112
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,680
and how people can get through it

1113
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,359
because i hear stories we've spoken

1114
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,119
about it's loads and loads of times over

1115
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,480
the last couple years

1116
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,520
around it's a tough job right

1117
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,920
it can be a tough job you are frontline

1118
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
triage

1119
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,680
any tips on how people can survive that

1120
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,440
kind of role

1121
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,200
yeah i think i'd answer that in in two

1122
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,880
ways one is at the individual

1123
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,320
level so i was a senior security analyst

1124
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
and you know did shift work and did all

1125
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,599
those things and i would definitely say

1126
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,520
you know the basics of self-care

1127
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,000
shift work sucks um for everyone who

1128
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,720
does it

1129
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,640
especially if you're if you're dealing

1130
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
in high stress situations which screech

1131
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,839
operations often is

1132
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,680
um so you know make sure that when

1133
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,960
you're on your downtime that you

1134
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,839
actually do

1135
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,599
feed and water you know your own

1136
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,359
emotionals um

1137
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,920
self you know go go for walks meditate

1138
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,960
if that's your thing

1139
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,640
game if that's your thing but you know

1140
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,000
look after yourself

1141
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,480
um during your shifts and take your

1142
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,119
breaks

1143
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,920
i was did never did this and i suffered

1144
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,880
for it

1145
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
but you know go go for your breaks go

1146
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,640
for your walks

1147
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,000
you know um do your best to limit

1148
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
caffeine where possible uh i say this as

1149
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,640
a person who

1150
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,400
finished their full-time degree while

1151
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,320
working full-time shift work it was a

1152
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,440
bad call and i regretted it deeply

1153
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,760
um as it took me four months to recover

1154
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,640
from doing it

1155
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,720
yeah but you know when you find yourself

1156
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,560
importing caffeinated chewing gum to

1157
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,520
stay awake

1158
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,280
you need to make some changes to the way

1159
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,240
you're managing your life

1160
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,040
quickly sorry sorry harry um great great

1161
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,400
answer thank you for that um

1162
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,160
thank you very much for uh to crypto

1163
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,240
cipher for collating a couple of

1164
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
other questions from the room which i

1165
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,440
missed

1166
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,920
are there any intro certs that you'd

1167
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,320
recommend for defenders

1168
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,119
um yeah sure so i think uh there's

1169
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,560
there's lots out there and

1170
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,400
i definitely wouldn't just kind of go

1171
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,160
there's definitely one and that's all we

1172
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,280
would look for

1173
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,000
um i think security plus from comptia is

1174
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,720
reasonable

1175
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,920
um i don't think it's too high level to

1176
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,400
be useless i don't think it's too hard

1177
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,000
not to be considered around the entry

1178
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,640
level

1179
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,480
and if you as long as you've got a

1180
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,920
background with some of the fundamentals

1181
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,599
of networking and some of the things i

1182
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,599
mentioned the security plus

1183
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,680
a really good step forward there's some

1184
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
industry certs in specific technologies

1185
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,640
that can be useful

1186
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
if you're trying to join or joining a

1187
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,200
sock that specifically works with splunk

1188
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,839
or with

1189
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,160
you know other products so there are a

1190
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,680
lot of foundational learnings and search

1191
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,280
specifically for those vendors but i

1192
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,720
would only do that if you know it's

1193
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,000
going to be beneficial

1194
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,079
for your role um but yeah security plus

1195
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,000
would be the one for me personally if

1196
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,960
you've already got

1197
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,040
some networking foundations if not then

1198
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,160
networking plus is

1199
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,320
probably where you want to start okay

1200
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,240
fair enough great great answer sec plus

1201
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,520
seems to be really popular you know we

1202
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,200
used to hear things about cis for being

1203
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,400
banded around and then

1204
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,160
oh you must have cespo you must have

1205
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,760
oscp and you must have this something

1206
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,240
the other

1207
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,000
but actually sec plus seems to be a

1208
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,839
really well balanced

1209
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,040
sir and i think you know cis is

1210
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,839
definitely not

1211
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,760
an entry level search i mean you've got

1212
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
to have five years

1213
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,040
on the job experience just to be

1214
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,800
considered for it or four years if

1215
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,160
you've done a degree so it's definitely

1216
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,680
entry level oscp

1217
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,520
is entry level but for you know

1218
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,880
pentesting and red teaming

1219
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,720
i would say more i mean it's very

1220
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,480
beneficial as a defender to know how

1221
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,000
they're going to attack you

1222
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,839
but for me it's more important that you

1223
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,240
can do your job as a defender well

1224
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,720
don't necessarily actively go out and do

1225
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,079
and orchestrate pen

1226
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,960
pen tests or red teaming type activity

1227
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,160
yeah totally agree

1228
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,800
