1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,549
get started in the industry and my first
responses

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:10,780
you've got to have hands-on because you
can't get it from books also I found

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:19,930
that some of my colleagues have been
doing like CNN or any for years and

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,720
they're losing their technical edge they
don't have their own labs there please

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,160
don't

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,539
employers don't provide them with any
kind of technical area where they can

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:34,250
test and learn and they're just they're
losing it there's just nothing but you

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,390
know interview upload the artifact go on
to the next thing it's it's it's sad so

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:51,079
anyway the next slide is my attempt at
animation works who am I i started in

10
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,300
the computer industry in 1982 believe it
or not I've been specializing in I T

11
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,620
security for the past 15 years I'm an
ass

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,790
there's my ass hat and shirt early signs
of weakness as a child they preferred

13
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:13,220
robots to dolls and good thing by the
ALP is pursuing me I seem to have become

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:20,400
a geek elder now in the beginning

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,689
curiosity in the introduction of more
portable computers created the current

16
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,860
created a phenomenon CEO Dixon basement
launched the computer industry as we

17
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,680
know it today you think of Jobs and Bill
Gates ok some of them were in garages

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,579
but you get the point

19
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:45,439
ok result basements not protect skills
and geeks are happy but now we come to

20
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,780
the problem

21
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,130
eventually have to leave your basement
if you're lucky enough to have one to

22
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,690
make a living

23
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,000
industry focus has shifted for practical
research to mandated compliance and

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,630
automated tools there is very real

25
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,010
they're very little real hands-on work
available

26
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,700
the result practical skills are
difficult to acquire and geeks are sad

27
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:17,370
but there's a solution we're gonna build
our own portable basement on a laptop

28
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:25,970
should go where you go and you can build
and sharpen your skills anywhere so the

29
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,200
first thing we're going to talk about is
hard to learn you gonna need a beefy

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,190
laptop its gonna need at least eight
gigs RAM I started with 8 10 12 16 and

31
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,100
it's working quite well

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,040
powerful processor quad cores
recommended you need at least a one

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,250
terabyte hard drive because we're gonna
be using virtual machines and they get

34
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,560
to be quite big amazingly laptops with
these suspects can be obtained through

35
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,020
Amazon for less than $500 so stuck in a
cost an arm and a leg and if your budget

36
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,840
allows gaming laptops are ideal in their
upgraded graphical processing units

37
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,060
speed-up password craft and there you go

38
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:18,530
my dream machine ok next to talk about
is the platform we were talking about

39
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:24,700
virtual machines virtual machine
blocking him so we're talking about

40
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:31,630
virtual machines and I like VirtualBox
it's free it's from Oracle is updated

41
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:41,190
regularly works very very well very
stable and it does things that other

42
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,200
free platform like VMware Player don't
do some of the things you can do with

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:54,860
virtual machine with VirtualBox is
create snapshots which you cannot do

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,610
with with VMware Player

45
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:04,980
snap traps let you take an image of your
virtual machine when you have it the way

46
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,870
you wanted and then if you make any
modifications and and you screw it up

47
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,300
you can roll back to the snapshot and
got your pristine machine back again

48
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,650
that's very important

49
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:25,400
the other thing that VirtualBox does is
it has guest additions which offers

50
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,460
excellent support for hardware which I
find that the end where player doesn't

51
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,400
support it's not as good as many devices
supported so for ease of use and

52
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:49,620
functionality I ripped recommend
VirtualBox virtual box runs on Intel or

53
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,100
AMD computers running Windows Mac Linux
or Solaris operating systems

54
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,350
cross-platform really great for example
you can run Windows and Linux on your

55
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,690
Mac and Windows Server 2008 on your
Linux server and run Linux on your

56
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,160
Windows PC and on and on

57
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,900
you can install and run as many virtual
machines you like the only practical

58
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,380
limits or disk space and memory or
memory you have the better than the

59
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,410
largest the larger disk the better
here's an example of VirtualBox running

60
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,740
on running Ubuntu 14 on a Windows 7
machine so you see doesn't have to be

61
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,580
the same type of operating system you
can run anything on anything as long as

62
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:46,040
they support and here's to virtual
machines running simultaneously we have

63
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:54,390
a window 7 workstation and Kelly Linux
server both running simultaneously

64
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:09,160
you can get a lot of free Linux BMC a
pre-built through a site called Virtual

65
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,700
Box is dot org

66
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,410
it provides virtual machines for
numerous free or open source operating

67
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,610
systems for education testing security
and entertainment purposes and if you

68
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:27,090
don't find what you want on VirtualBox
virtual box instead org you can go to

69
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:35,270
the EVM website and download the iso and
VirtualBox can be used to create of the

70
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,540
M from the ISO so there's another
version of Linux that you want and it's

71
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:49,460
not present on this site not a problem
here is a virtual boxes is currently

72
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,050
offering you see that they have some of
the more popular Linux distros like

73
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,630
Debian cent OS and fedora and some
intriguing packages such as dream Linux

74
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,430
and Damn Small Linux got a pretty good
idea but damn Small Linux promptly you

75
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,470
know footprint but I'm wondering what
dream Linux is about new features

76
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:19,220
include unicorns and kittens dunno gonna
have to check that out

77
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:31,580
now this is really cool when I first
started doing this was windows 2000 and

78
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,630
then Windows XP and you can make as many
windows xp

79
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:41,480
clones as you wanted to see when she
read the end not a problem

80
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:51,620
the same is not true for Windows 7 I
bought a copy of Windows seven Pro made

81
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,360
to the M

82
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,680
tried to clone it sure enough it's
asking me for another license so that's

83
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,570
not working anymore however you can get
these from Microsoft they offer free

84
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:11,870
virtual machines is for testing as part
of the modern ie project because they're

85
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,030
tied two different versions of IE the
idea is to be used by developers to test

86
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,700
compatibility with their website with
different the different versions of

87
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,880
however what you're getting is fully
functional copies of the operating

88
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,810
system and you can use them for testing
or any other anything else you want

89
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:43,070
currently you can get IE six on XP IE 7
and Vista ie8 on XP Windows XP is dead

90
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:51,990
ie8 on Windows 7 and Windows 7 and
Windows seven laps ie10 a Windows 8 I E

91
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:59,780
11 on Windows 8 2010 back to Windows 7
11 on Windows 7 and Microsoft Microsoft

92
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:10,480
edge on Windows yeah that's the next
like no ninety however its next like the

93
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,120
question

94
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,209
alright so here's

95
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:20,470
what microsoft recommends the VMAs will
expire in 90 days but microsoft

96
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,990
recommends that you take a snapshot of
the V em so that you can restore it and

97
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:32,959
if you're using VirtualBox it has the
functionality so you can also get under

98
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:43,490
different program free Windows Server
but the evaluation copies of Windows

99
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,980
server products in either HDD or ISO
format

100
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,220
these are not virtual machines
themselves but can be easily made into

101
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,240
virtual machines by VirtualBox it has
that capability VHD stands for Virtual

102
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,800
Hard Drive real easy to convert and I so
is the same thing you would get if you

103
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,829
downloaded any other operating system
and it's it's able to convert that

104
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:21,959
easily now these have 180 day evaluation
period I have not tried it tried doing

105
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,939
the the snapshot in the rolling back I'm
not sure that would work but I have

106
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:31,689
after a hundred and eighty days gone and
just downloaded a new evaluation copy so

107
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:40,549
know that works so now we're gonna have
some fun what's in your basement we're

108
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:46,629
going to talk about some special special
purpose pre-built Linux distros that you

109
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:52,689
can add to your basement for learning
and see what kind of damage it can do

110
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:57,850
the first when you're probably familiar
with Tali Lennox if you want to study

111
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,779
penetration testing you can't do better
than this

112
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,860
its Roe sense of security there's the
link and I'm going to provide these

113
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,040
slides on my website so that you can go
through the slides and get the links to

114
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,329
all the software that I'm talking about

115
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,559
its preinstalled with over 600
penetration testing programs including

116
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:24,470
nmap where shark John the Ripper
aircraft in G wireless LAN interesting

117
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:31,339
sweet burp and SAP web application
security scanners and tons more trust me

118
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:41,589
look at the password to tech tools
included Kelly Linux and you can also

119
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,360
see they've got information gathering
vulnerability analysis Wireless attack

120
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,959
tools and much much more

121
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:56,319
some other pen testing distros include
back box which is Unix based and it's

122
00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:02,079
developed to perform penetration tests
it's designed to be fast and easy to use

123
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,939
also there's samurai WTF which is a live
Linux environment that has been

124
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:13,499
pre-configured to function specifically
as a web testing environment anybody

125
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:21,929
know what WTF stands were originally I
thought it was what the fuck and I

126
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:27,509
thought that was pretty cool but web
testing framework is good to know I like

127
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:28,860
that too

128
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:36,269
okay and there's a there's a peak it
back box now appear compared to Cali

129
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:42,160
Linux it's got 75 tools whereas Kelly
has 600 however some preferred because

130
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,019
of its ease of use and speed it said to
be faster than Cali and here's our

131
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:55,990
friend samurai WTF

132
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:02,640
this is specifically designed for this
is specifically designed for web testing

133
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,070
and so the the tools that you can find
their or your toward that took sort of

134
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:15,190
planetary penetration testing now once
you've got some pen test tool in

135
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,190
addition to year Microsoft OS is there
some specific Pinterest targets that you

136
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,010
can download that are deliberately
vulnerable so you can actually just the

137
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,940
tools and find what you're looking for
some of these include medicine herbal

138
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:38,709
which is reused with the Metasploit
Framework came over and asked broken web

139
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:46,610
applications project which one works
really good with samurai here's a look

140
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:55,140
at the vulnerable web applications
direct Directory Project currently and

141
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:03,339
you'll see they've got there we've got
something really interesting called

142
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,630
admin with hacking challenge I think
it's an archives now but you might still

143
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:20,649
be broken web application project from
and what few others that are available

144
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:29,920
free to investigate now for other
basement content if your interests run

145
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,370
to malware analysis lenny's meltzer has
provided a distro of Linux for malware

146
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:45,750
announces and there's also the sandbox
open source software for the automated

147
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,110
analysis of suspicious files also and I
think this is pretty cool when he has

148
00:14:51,110 --> 00:15:00,140
put together a list of sites where you
can get sample malware for testing

149
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:15,490
look at remarks it's got tools like a
pro and only to bug for reverse

150
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,890
engineering it's us against tools
specialized tools for website Flash Java

151
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,920
and JavaScript analysis as well as
applications for analyzing malicious

152
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,940
PDFs and Microsoft Office files pretty
cool and there's the cuckoo sandbox

153
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:40,220
which is interesting when you implement
the Google Sandbox its avium and you run

154
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,390
another via AIM within it and malware
runs on that internal via pretty cool

155
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:56,930
here see List of malware simple sources
for research and when he reminds us to

156
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:03,130
be careful not to infect yourself when
you're studying malware it can happen

157
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:08,400
now

158
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,070
couple of the other tools I want to tell
you about our for forensics so if you're

159
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,690
interested in getting to forensics these
sands investigative forensic Toolkit or

160
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,500
shift work station is a group of free
open-source incident response and

161
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,620
forensics tools and Samurai peloton is a
Linux distribution based on Ubuntu for

162
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,400
performing setup forensics tasks

163
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:42,480
here's a look at the SIFT workstation it
includes things like memory and network

164
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,820
analysis tools as well as incident
handling in evidence gathering tools

165
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,110
and here's samurai paladin it contains
some of the top open source forensic

166
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,450
tools available it's useful for triage
imaging an examination of forensics

167

evidence they were 16 calorie categories
of tools available

168
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:12,490
everything from data carving to mobile
device and analysis we see easy to use

169
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,930
but they requested donation of at least
$25 if you like it
