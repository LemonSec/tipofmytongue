1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,789
25 minutes lot and I have to go a little
bit fast will make quick an introduction

2
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:23,380
skip over couple things and just to let
you know there's a lot more on this

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,430
to talk about so if you're interested in
discussing other strategies rather

4
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,539
scenarios and more than happy to meet up
afterwards if you wanna chat more so

5
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,820
briefly I'm josh Stone you can find me
on the internet have have been before

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,360
it's my second year as a speaker really
love it

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,140
becoming my favorite conference in the
year I worked for PSE TSC is primarily a

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,950
PCI company and we do it a number of
different things but my particular piece

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,820
of it is penetration testing so you're
always looking for the 16 digit numbers

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,940
what it means is I usually end up in
environments that look a little bit

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,519
kinda like this where we've got a
company with a whole normal corporate

12
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,140
network but there's a particular subset
some piece of it which is the PCI

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,799
network and that has to be segmented and
protected differently from the rest of

14
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,830
the environment so we end up with a lot
of interesting scenarios where somebody

15
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,360
has made attempts to segment that zone
separately from the other pieces and

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,100
gives us a lot of interesting pen
testing challenges so today I'm

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,780
specifically talking about MFA and I'm
gonna kind of assume that pretty much

18
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,079
everybody knows what multi-factor is
just very briefly talked a little bit

19
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,950
about it

20
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,630
multi-factor is basically anytime that
you need something more than just a

21
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,579
password to login so you might have
something like this hanging off your

22
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,530
keychain generates a random number every
30 seconds or something like that or

23
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,600
maybe you forego that and you have an
app on your phone

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,990
some like that they're a bunch of
different designs and different

25
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,399
architectures break down into a couple
major types in a couple examples today

26
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,920
about practical attacks against them

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,190
the main take-home for the pen tester
and probably true

28
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:16,130
evil intruder is that dear I'm not
getting on my slides so with MFA getting

29
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,770
a password is not enough all by itself
you have to get a little bit more than

30
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,370
just a password so a lot of times if we
get an escalated position the network

31
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,000
and we start cracking hashes it we found
our remaining cats and get a bunch of

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,790
pastors office somebody's box from Dell
SAS that's not enough to get past the

33
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,480
MFA and that's what makes it very
interesting so a lot of networks that

34
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,010
are porous without MFA become difficult
I'm talking about practical attacks and

35
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,030
by that I don't mean that I'm talking
about finding an isolated 0 day against

36
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,130
an MFA applications or infrastructure
I'm talking about attacking multi-factor

37
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,560
in its context where it lives in the
network as some talking about a

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,430
particular scenario and I just wanna
make it really clear I'm not overstating

39
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,020
or somehow over embellishing something
there are a lot of other scenarios that

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,420
we could talk about this is just the one
that's particularly important to me so I

41
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,310
thought to be good in order to set up
the scenario to develop a picture of

42
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:27,480
what the pen test WoW is there any way
to make that better hold on

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,180
is a possible be awesome

44
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,719
executive more no its not clear

45
00:03:38,719 --> 00:04:05,120
yeah that's what if I don't get my
priest like that that's better

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:21,289
there's no reason the adapter would make
a difference right actually yeah it's

47
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:26,620
gonna keep it on there you go see ahead
I'm sorry it won't be as dramatic as

48
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:35,320
saying we will make due right sorry for
the delay

49
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:43,380
alright so you're hearing

50
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:58,810
ok so the picture of what the pen test
looks like without multi-factor and you

51
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,320
see what the changes we Thermaltake
factored into the mix so I plug in the

52
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,760
internet work and I can use some
low-hanging fruit now find in its

53
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,460
initial entry point that gets me
authenticated rights not admin nothing

54
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,700
particularly interesting well then use
that to escalate gonna get that to

55
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,120
domain admin or maybe local admin have
actually had success running

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,050
multi-factor with only local admin on a
small number of machines if those happen

57
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,850
to be the machines are useful for you I
want some kind of admin rights and I'm

58
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,300
gonna find the users access the PCI
network in this case and target them

59
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,000
specifically get their credentials that
they use so I can login to the boxes

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,410
that give access to the specials out
that separated from the rest of the

61
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,610
environment and then I'm going to
compromise a CD and that constitutes my

62
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,540
success criteria for the pen test so in
PCI there's this interesting thing that

63
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,870
changed a little bit with the three x
standard a little more verbiage on

64
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,990
segmentation they really have two
segments that area so that even if

65
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,370
something outside the PCI zone is
compromised it doesn't impact the

66
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,480
security of the PCR which means my pen
test there is a PCI problem because all

67
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,160
I have to do is vertically escalate
inside and hot directly into the sea de

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,780
la customer looks at that and they say
oh gee I gotta find some way to stop

69
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,180
that and i cant control my internal
network enough to keep you from getting

70
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,130
that vertical escalation you guys get
admin every year so this is kind of a

71
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,110
natural fit for multi-factor because now
you can say I'll give you all the

72
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,430
passwords and having those you still
can't get in because you don't have your

73
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,620
hardware device so now let's think about
what the pen test looks like with the

74
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,780
MFA I'm gonna find some low-hanging
fruit I'm going to escalate that domain

75
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,890
admin find the users access to CDE and
use that to somehow magically with pixie

76
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,810
dust or whatever

77
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,960
tone MFA login and achieve my success
criteria

78
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,069
and what I want you to see is that in
context in a real breach this is the

79
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,410
situation where I'm going to attack
multi-factor on the internal network is

80
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,710
irrelevant so much to you in trying to
get through the VPN login from your

81
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,960
Starbucks wifi or something like that
there are other M&A scenarios to think

82
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,130
about but on the internal network when
you're protecting a special area from

83
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,050
the rest of the untrusted environment
and this is how it looks and there are

84
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,500
few things and I have there's only one
little difference between these two Penn

85
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,080
tests but this is what I've got I have
probably domain admin I probably can

86
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,070
keylogger observe what the users are
doing on their workstations and I have

87
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,410
plaintext passwords I know actually what
they are and even if they're really

88
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,580
complicated ones once I'm admin many
cats get me whatever I want which is the

89
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,539
best friend and I have access to the
workstation that's going to access

90
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:49,449
something through multi-factor so
attacking MFA directly like I said

91
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:52,500
before if i'm looking for that day
against Timothy it's going to be hard

92
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,810
and a lot of that is because of
cryptography you got a random number

93
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,919
generators with seeds he got handshakes
all kinds of interesting things that

94
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,250
they are you know out of my pay grade
for a three-day pen test but as a pen

95
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,699
tester when I'm looking for is something
that gets me past MFA and I don't

96
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,289
necessarily have to beat the MFA design
itself just find a way to circumvent it

97
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:20,849
or get around it I'm happy with that so
it's time to go through a couple

98
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:23,710
examples in this is what I can fit in
the talk there are few more I got like

99
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,759
eight or ten scenarios I'd love to go
through but these are the two that I

100
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,380
think ur gonna work the best for the
first one to talk about is RSA Security

101
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,589
so SecurID which I assume most people
are going to be relatively familiar with

102
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,810
is we have a little vodka that on the
keychain they're also soft tokens and

103
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,550
other ways of doing it but basically
this gives you a second factor in

104
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,480
addition to your password

105
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:57,529
so the procedure for the user to log
into in this case a remote desktop

106
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,750
service unit access to other services
but for the presentation and talk about

107
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,589
the RDP scenario this is what it looks
like retyping your username and password

108
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:11,709
your passcode sorry it's a value that
goes right in front of the six digits

109
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,089
now we wait for next token value can we
gotta get that at the beginning if we

110
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:20,690
don't we'll type 1 in in in earnest and
it won't work is already type in our

111
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,820
second factor which is at six digit code
on the FOB wait for the prompt after

112
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,519
that because it hopefully works and we
talked to her eighty password and we get

113
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,459
remote desktop access and when I look at
that first time I came up against this

114
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,630
and really really really wanted to be a
factor I didn't want to just say you

115
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,810
guys have not affected you when I
noticed something about this process

116
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,430
that was very interesting and suggests
to me that there's a way that we can

117
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:51,839
attack this thing and that's the use of
the word type in a lot of places you

118
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,569
noticed especially there are two things
we type that are critical to

119
00:09:55,569 --> 00:10:00,760
multi-factor we type the second factor
first ironically and then we type the

120
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,569
first factor that eighty password and if
you remember from our scenario I'm

121
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:10,420
already a diamond and i own the keyboard
so I can I can observe the keyboard and

122
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,760
I can manipulate the keyboard I can
inject keystrokes I can respond to take

123
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,190
action when certain key sequences occur
and that gives me an opportunity to

124
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,949
attack security in this case so the way
the attack works as an example from a

125
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:30,910
real pen test I've done this a number of
times at this point myself and other

126
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,089
guys on our team first thing I do is I
look at the resource that I'm going to

127
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,980
log into I want to understand exactly
how it works because different versions

128
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,829
of Windows login little differently
sometimes you have to press ctrl alt

129
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,740
delete before you can get the proper
other times you might have the legal

130
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,019
disclaimer or something like that you
don't have this system where you get in

131
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,209
trouble and I want to make sure they
understand exactly how this is going to

132
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:54,990
work even though I don't have that
second factor I need understanding very

133
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,769
carefully

134
00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:00,160
because I'm gonna write and automation
script and what this does is I assume in

135
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,499
the script that at some magic moment I
have the six digit value I know the user

136
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,329
name I know their password and I have a
six digit value that's going to work for

137
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:14,679
a short period of time if I have that
this script will automatically log in

138
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,389
forming going to start remote desktop it
away three seconds and press Enter

139
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:23,799
these guys had to enter screens so I had
to wait a few seconds press Enter again

140
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:28,389
no type in the username press tab
etcetera this automates the login

141
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:36,259
process the next thing I do next thing I
do is I install a keylogger on all of

142
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:40,220
the target users so I figured out which
users usually make network connections

143
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,230
to the CDE or something like that might
have one or two hundred users targeting

144
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,470
so I installed this and this is an
in-house keylogger

145
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,759
I put together for this this attack this
one I can harvest from a large number of

146
00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:00,059
machines and its instrumented with
attack modes specifically for SecurID

147
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:04,790
where I can instruct all of the key
loggers start watching for six digit

148
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,189
codes if you see a six digit code let me
know and when they find one they notify

149
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:14,949
my admin console and say hey I think I
found one so here's an example sometimes

150
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:19,959
are false positives is somebody's
editing a spreadsheet for example or

151
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:25,410
maybe their coding and my type six digit
numbers for other reasons it's going to

152
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,769
look at it but this one looks pretty
obviously like a log in we can see that

153
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:35,850
this guy's passcode that precede the six
digit number is 765 4321 a serious

154
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,679
anyway

155
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,119
followed by 80 40 to 70 that's a six
digit value you press ENTER and then

156
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:45,860
following that is something that looks
very suspiciously like a password and

157
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,850
you get two guesses about when I took
the screenshot

158
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,259
once I clearly identified that I can
instruct his keylogging agent to switch

159
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:00,420
modes and I tell it now I know what this
guy's passcode is next time you see it

160
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,589
six digit number

161
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:07,199
preceded by that passcode go and jump
into action and we're going to

162
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,509
compromise it so the way that looks is I
wait some time maybe his remote desktop

163
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,620
window locks and he has to unlock it
baby goes to lunch or something comes

164
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,519
back catalogue back in could be a couple
hours whatever next time he logs in the

165
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,430
keylogger detects that and then it sends
a message back to the key logging server

166
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:33,610
and it says I think we've got a case
where we know what the sixty-two value

167
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,160
is and it takes a special action at this
point what it does is it kills the MSTS

168
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,899
C dot exe process and so what the user
experiences is he dutifully puts in his

169
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,500
code wait for the thing to show up on
his token type said it and at the moment

170
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,250
of the 6th digit keystroke his window
disappears and sometimes I used to be

171
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,509
really concerned about possibly getting
detected by a user in this situation but

172
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:03,639
in real life what users do is they say I
hate this computer is so slow I wish

173
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,819
they'd give me a better one

174
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:10,050
this always happens to me and he'll try
again cos he figures he never hit enter

175
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,610
never clicked ok so you can see that he
tries again with the same code but it

176
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:21,149
doesn't work and that's because I used
the code and so he tries a third time

177
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,310
and finally gets it and that's what the
next code on his token

178
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:30,230
but in the meantime I now have my remote
desktop window because I've stolen his

179
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,950
session and you might think well with
remote desktop won't he just steal my

180
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,440
session back it turns out in a lot of
places they'll have more than one jump

181
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,460
box also give you an exaggerated case of
it later even having this desktop for a

182
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:49,560
short period of time is useful in half
but at this point I'm in a really good

183
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,630
position to solidify my control of that
cardholder data environment because I'm

184
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,640
circumvented MFA one time but now I can
look for a persistence vector I can try

185
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,630
to find a way can I communicate back out
from that box to my machine and get a

186
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,330
persistence that way can i connect to
the public Internet can I paying maybe I

187
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,089
can tunnel at the ICMP I'm trying to
find some way that I can sustain my

188
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:17,620
access now and I never have to happen if
they get so it's a one-time thing in the

189
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:26,450
typical scenario so what's fun about
this is it's not really a vulnerability

190
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:34,310
in security and I'm sorry was at the the
10 minutes cool so it's not necessarily

191
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,030
a flaw in security number generation
works fine and I didn't compromise that

192
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,860
I didn't get his seed I didn't guess
it's eat anything of that nature

193
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,430
what it really is is as far as RSA is
concerned that this is a time where the

194
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:53,220
user needs to secure their in point and
any guesses how hard it is to secure an

195
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:59,260
end point so that a domain admin can't
do this to really really hard into some

196
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,490
places that are running top tier
defensive tools and unless you're

197
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,400
particularly careful this ends up
working quite well you use an unknown

198
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,540
keylogger and be willing to adapt it or
something in the process and what this

199
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,620
means is that this kind of attack

200
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,050
kind of will always work probably in any
case we got this keyboard focused

201
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,320
multi-factor is going to mention to
security is not the only one there are a

202
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,270
number of other token based systems
their mobile bay systems are you still

203
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,680
type the code in C can adapt the same
designer this strategy to work in a lot

204
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,769
of cases

205
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:39,800
you might say that's not how all
multi-factor works so what if you're

206
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,149
using a multi-factor design that doesn't
really rely on the keyboard and those do

207
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:45,999
exist

208
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:52,170
2011 fine example of it and that's due
out anybody heard of duo cool as a tiny

209
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:58,029
hands rates I used to have a couple
different things and do is really need

210
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:01,989
it has the six digit number thing but
you don't have to use that you can force

211
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:06,569
your application to do a mobile push and
so what it looks like when the user logs

212
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:11,100
in as they authenticate with their
normal Active Directory credentials and

213
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,149
then they wait for a mobile push and it
shows up on the phone and they authorize

214
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:21,039
it there so there's no there's no second
factor going into the same channel is

215
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,549
the first factor so this type of MFA
requires a fundamentally different

216
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:30,120
strategy and when I would get this I
step back and thought about this process

217
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,860
there's one little word they're the kind
of sticks out as a little beacon that

218
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,399
says maybe there's a way to attack this
and it's a question that get gets raised

219
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:45,260
by that word wait what happens between
the moment when I type in my password

220
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,350
should say password sorry and the moment
when i authorized on the phone and

221
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:57,020
there's an interesting race condition in
do a where if you have two concurrent

222
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:03,429
push notifications going to the phone
only one of them appears and any guess

223
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:08,580
which one gets authorised always a
second one it was always the first one

224
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,909
its ability if it was random you just
try a couple times eventually get it at

225
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:17,789
any rate the compression of those push
notifications makes it very interesting

226
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:29,889
so I'm gonna show hopefully video here
this is a very awkward so on the left

227
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:34,830
we've got user he's gonna log in with
2002 a multi-factor resource and you

228
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,660
know that

229
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,820
is unsatisfactory

230
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,230
this work so then over on the other side
is my machine and I'm going to establish

231
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,680
she'll remember have had been I just
want to get into that CTE I'm gonna

232
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,180
create a service which is just a custom
malware that I built that monitors the

233
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,590
behavior of the user and what it's
looking for is that moment where the

234
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:06,040
push notification is going to go out and
then also at the end here hopefully you

235
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,820
can see it

236
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,370
have a network service at the bottom
where once I start that service on the

237
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,970
victim's machine I now have a network
and money on my side that's going to

238
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:21,290
wait for the signal that tells me that
MSA is about to happen so now over on

239
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,930
the victim side and users can log in
what was really interesting in this case

240
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,190
is how do you tell when the push
notification goes out it goes out when

241
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,920
the desktop session is created which
also corresponds exactly with when

242
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,180
remote desktop uses more than 27 K of
memory so all I do is watch your network

243
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,610
connection at 2:33 89 and whenever that
memory usage goes over 27 K

244
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,710
that's my signal so you can see over
here on the left we've got a pushed

245
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,420
login request to my device and then on
the right you can kind of see it on the

246
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,830
corner it says it received the command
and it's making a connection will see

247
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:08,560
where is it and is so see that now we're
in the race we got two notifications

248
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,430
going out the user authorizes it and
it's my net wins because I was the

249
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:19,670
second one out and what happens on the
left side is the user will time out it

250
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,020
would take about 60 seconds

251
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,440
gives me minimally a 60 second window
where I could for example download a

252
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,690
powershell one-liner that installs my
agent and then he won't even know when

253
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,570
she still session back but then usually
there's going to be more than one box

254
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,710
that I can log into my log into the
second one he likes into the first one

255
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,410
and I've got it

256
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:48,930
thank you so we talk to you about this
cause this is actually kind of a

257
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,990
vulnerability and so they released a
feature earlier this summer that allows

258
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,740
you to detect the double push and
prevent that from working on the client

259
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,260
side the hard part is it affects a user
experience and there are actually times

260
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,970
into a legitimate Lee does a double push
apparently we found out in conversation

261
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:13,460
with them so it turn it ends up being an
opt-in feature which means that every

262
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,080
time I go somewhere that uses duo I'm
gonna try it anyway because if they

263
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,660
don't have that turned on their still
vulnerable to a lot of places it would

264
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:25,080
consider this type of attack not a huge
risk that's a that's that's kind of

265
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,530
exotic and elaborate and you know if
they're going to try that hard they can

266
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,650
have it but for places where you got
your CD or something that's highly

267
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,440
critical protector that this might be of
concern so you can make sure if you run

268
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:45,480
into a check that out make sure you have
that turned on so attacking MFA in PC

269
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,610
environments like I'm talking about
probably similar environments as well

270
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,340
usually comes down to your client side
attacks or timing attacks race

271
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,230
conditions in 2012 race condition and
they all have a similar character there

272
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,210
gonna be some sort of probabilistic
success scenario the kind they work

273
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,920
sometimes not all the time it's not like
I'm sooo 8067 where is this fire and

274
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,540
forget on the other hand if you think
about it like say the user tax basis

275
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,280
while they're typing in their pass code
or something and I keylogger doesn't

276
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,860
trigger it's really not that big of a
deal is it doesn't cause a problem and I

277
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,740
just wait till the next time they log in
so in real life these work very reliably

278
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,270
it just takes time and I find that it's
usually by the time I get to the

279
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,020
position to launch this attack is
probably a couple hours before I get one

280
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,500
of the MFA session stolen like this it
really does work quite well and in my

281
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:42,190
feeling time here we can talk about it
out a little bit of mitigation if you're

282
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,200
concerned about these types of threats
in areas you know what do you do

283
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,500
major major point i think is it's really
easy to attack those in channel second

284
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,370
factors I don't say out of band caused a
lot of people will consider the six

285
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,279
digit code generator to be out of band
but it's not out of channel because the

286
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,950
second factor is delivered in the same
the same mechanism that uses the first

287
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:12,679
factor so out of jail design type
approach there some others liked that is

288
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,289
much more interesting get the ones where
it sends an SMS can you reply to it or

289
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:21,000
something like that those are a lot
harder to attack and then secondly if

290
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,240
you can't do that then hard in the end
point it is very difficult but it can be

291
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,370
done your main goal is to stop code
execution if you can keep your admins

292
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,340
from running code on the workstations
and you can imagine things like local

293
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,590
firewalls very restrictive policies
maybe some defensive tools like nine or

294
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,700
something like that that lets you more
strictly control execution it is

295
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,159
possible to do that and then finally
training users I have watched as I'm

296
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,490
keylogging I watched a conversation with
a guy and his I T support saying I keep

297
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,179
it failed on me and I've never seen it
felt that way before that he was a

298
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:58,399
particularly entertaining user and
diagnosing it as a network glitch

299
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:03,510
because computers just do that sometimes
so it's actually quite rare for

300
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,700
something like this to be even seen as a
security event and frankly it's going to

301
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,590
happen once or twice in the breach so
it's not like you're gonna have a bunch

302
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,970
of data points people say a lot of
people are failing there anything else

303
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,830
today it's not like that you should
train people are accessing a highly

304
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,669
critical resource that any kind of funny
glitch could potentially be a security

305
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:30,649
event so with that I think I have very
little time for questions maybe one

306
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:32,409
question

307
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:38,860
yeah so if you go in

308
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:44,340
hopefully if you look in under lockout
in fraud there's a checkbox that says

309
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:50,570
block anomalous sorry block anomalous do
a push it attempts so they did post a

310
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,690
blog post about it that's terrible
grammar they created a blog post about

311
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:00,309
it earlier this summer so you can find
some information about that there didn't

312
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:03,780
want to create a CD anything because
it's a cloud-based service and the

313
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,830
applied it but it's important that
people understand that that is there and

314
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:22,220
it's available if you care about the
scenario right there are other scenarios

315
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,730
are really really fun stuff I just
couldn't fit in so if you wanna chat

316
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,309
more after it's fine
