1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
and I think it to talk yesterday I think
actually had some very good

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,599
representation right now this is my
first ever contact list and I'm like to

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,299
think so far so what the song is about
generally we're gonna talk a little bit

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,130
about how random generators are
implemented in some cases how to predict

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,619
those things I'm gonna release a tool
that will help facilitate that reduction

6
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,160
and we can talk about how you can
leverage the predictability of some

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,029
random generators into actual attacks
against real-world systems and unless

8
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:34,630
they're going to wrap things up with a
little bit of an explanation of how you

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,629
can mitigate this kind of predictability
how can you avoid your orange is being

10
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,469
protected and people attacked me so I'm
not going to tell you I'm going to

11
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:45,879
assume that everyone here knows not to
use ran to generate their their private

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,930
keys to private keys need to be like
strongly cryptographically secure so I'm

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,260
assuming that everyone uses SSL or
something reasonably decent to do that

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,809
no one probably rights Python little
python script to generate the properties

15
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:02,750
I sent that using a strong security and
I'm not gonna talk about school attacks

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,659
it is possible that you can have Cisco
anomalies in Orangi that will you know

17
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:12,560
an attacker could leverage for example
if you had a gambling website it would

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,530
be pretty irrelevant if the numbers that
you generated had some Cisco anomaly

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,900
that an attacker could be like oh I can
if I felt like this and I make millions

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,140
of dollars from you so there definitely
are ways that there could be problems

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,680
like that but it's not the kind of thing
that really focusing on very much so

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,780
before we really get into things going
to cover a little bit I'm gonna assume

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,700
that you know basically nothing about
random number generators are a little

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,700
bit about the difference between
cryptographically secure and not enough

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,070
to secure loans as you're told that
before we get into the rest of the talk

26
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,590
so completely secure our energies are
characterized by three properties right

27
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,579
the first of which is the most obvious
they must be unpredictable so given any

28
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,899
number of outlets from the orangey you
must be impossible to say what the next

29
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,200
one will be that's probably the most the
most evident thing about security the

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,509
second one is a little bit stranger if
someone is able to compromise your

31
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:11,130
system so they have total control of
everything they can make the RGA out

32
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,320
they want they can completely it still
must be impossible for them to recover

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,170
prior values output by the RNG it really
bad for breaking your system in recovery

34
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,520
RSA private key generator last week so
far from secure on geez you can't then

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,750
that needs to be impossible and lastly
there are statistical requirements are

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,450
not going to get into but suffice it to
say it must be fairly difficult to

37
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,660
distinguish outlets from such a
cryptographically secure our energy from

38
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,120
just ran about it right so if you're you
when you look at this point I don't know

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,100
if this is just the cosmic microwave
background or what or if it's actually a

40
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,150
random number generator should be it
should be really hard to tell the

41
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,600
difference

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,560
nonproductive guarantees fail in one of
these three categories either you can

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,420
predict the following numbers you can
recover prior ones or they're very

44
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,380
obviously not truly random so for
example one might always out but even

45
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,720
numbers even if it's unpredictable it
still always even so obviously that's

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,800
not just like a random thing it's it's
an output from some kind of typically

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,660
most actual oranges you're likely to use
that are not secure bail in at least two

48
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,090
areas in many cases they fell in all
three so they'll be clearly they're not

49
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,790
really random their predictable and you
can recover profits that's pretty rough

50
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,530
and the real problem here is that while
languages and platforms provide a lot of

51
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,840
different ways to generate or injuries
they are almost always not secure about

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,040
a fault usually you have to learn more
about security and you have to reach for

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,630
the tools to generate secure private
secure unpredictable random numbers

54
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,970
almost always their fault and I i say
that to the extreme that I am unable to

55
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,220
find a language that by default gives
you can secure R&G almost always it is

56
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,320
something you can usually fairly easily
Tripoli predict and doctors can

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,440
definitely use this if you're doing
something like generating session IDs

58
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,560
with a truly critical value that's
obviously a problem hopefully not doing

59
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,690
something that obvious but there are
more subtle ways that you can you can

60
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,670
use not guarantees so we're going a
little bit of a demo for the uninitiated

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:17,470
you don't know anything about see this
just that there is a default see random

62
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,200
number generator and so you can call us
around and you kind of initialize it

63
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,849
with a value

64
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,810
to get a value from it so this just see
the thing with some input that i'm gonna

65
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,040
ask you for that you know I haven't
there's no sleight of hand going on here

66
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,800
and then I'm gonna put 50 values from it
and we're going to a little

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,580
demonstration with particularly here and
I'm not standing way and I like in the

68
00:04:42,580 --> 00:05:02,810
middle of the night alright this is what
it was all me I could do that I'm coming

69
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,620
back and you can probably tell so what
you throw out a number that is an

70
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,390
unsigned integer and don't try to
undercut me or something and always take

71
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,480
a number

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,180
anybody any number

73
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:29,430
alright so many numbers that are based
on the 727 immunity to the disease are

74
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,790
nonsense here to do in the Windows
command prompt come with us

75
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,790
carpet alright for season 2 I'm gonna
talk about here you can see he helped

76
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,580
train for it here in a sec is the name
of your underwear of the kind of

77
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,400
Microsoft's compiler now you'll notice
here that I copied the first three

78
00:05:50,400 --> 00:06:00,070
Valleys not sure to be a little
disconcerting has a lot to predict the

79
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:07,610
dot exe thing just kills me knows that
this is the same values right the ones

80
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,180
that follow so I said you got these
three numbers the next one's going to be

81
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:22,920
one thousand eleven thousand 53 and sure
enough 7053 is in fact there is in fact

82
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,820
this number in this is

83
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,630
should be kind of distance learning to
you unless you turn your life around

84
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:34,760
just obviously not the scary but I mean
with three outputs you can predict not

85
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:46,420
just the subsequent 10 but subsequent
hundred or user moved everybody there

86
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,950
will ever be out so once you have three
you know every song though every

87
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,290
predicted for the rest of time and
that's kind of an issue and it's not

88
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,900
remotely unique to the Visual Studios
randon see this is a really call it a

89
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,610
problem across basically all non-secure
Angie's once you know a little bit about

90
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,630
it usually are less than people suspect
you can predict all future once and

91
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,580
that's kind of an issue so in this
particular case was work I promise it

92
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,930
won't be a lot of math alright I'm gonna
go through the question everybody calm

93
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:24,290
down so no one's run for the door that's
good so acts in this case is just an

94
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,920
outfit from the oranges simple enough
right sex offenders the accident was one

95
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,050
of the next hour so all this is the next
outfit from the orangey is just whatever

96
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,410
the last one was time some constant a
plus some constancy modulus some

97
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,680
constant and that should be cause
because that means if you have any

98
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,890
output you just beat it through this
thing in a loop and you can just keep

99
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,940
doing it for everything that you can get
the next one of the last that long after

100
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,000
that and so on and so forth

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,340
time and that's these are constants here
and there are trivially findable with

102
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,000
reverse engineering or they're usually
fairly often they're just documented

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,320
just read through the Java documentation
and they say hey are and uses those

104
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,610
constants here they are and you can just
beaten into this thing and predict the

105
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,240
future once these are generally called
when you're hungry until generators

106
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,020
which is quite a mouthful some refer to
them as LCDs and they're used in the

107
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:24,880
defaults for everything from here and in
C and C++ to PHP 10 next end in Java the

108
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,540
mice equal one uses a fairly similar
mechanism and all of them have this

109
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,260
trivial predictability in addition to
that they also have obviously by

110
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,849
statistical characteristics because
those are points generator from LG and

111
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,919
they just make lines

112
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,459
three-dimensional space like you can
just pick some points and they just make

113
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,019
it on the line so obviously he just
grabbed some outlets from it as very

114
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:48,870
poor system characteristics that is
obviously not true there and if I get

115
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,649
injured he doesn't like that there are
of course other things that are not a

116
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,010
cure but are not LCDs are common when
you may have heard of emerging twister

117
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,610
the cloud of points here is generated
with Python this random which is a

118
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,870
Mersenne Twister implementation and so
it obviously looks a bit more and it is

119
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,680
like has better statistical gold is not
going to get into what exactly that

120
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,560
means but suffice to say it doesn't make
a bunch of lines but they're still

121
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,829
predictable you need a few more news
after twenty four outputs to predict

122
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:19,190
future ones which that certainly makes
some attacks not feasible but for sure

123
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,050
their situations where you can still get
624 output and their other ones like

124
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,019
added feedback which is restored this
weird thing that you go to use it as he

125
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:35,490
tried to trust me so to release the
exciting presentation so you don't have

126
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,389
to do all the things because it's not
quite as trivial as I made it seem

127
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,980
earlier with that thing usually they
shift away a bunch of bits in an effort

128
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,910
to obfuscate things and they tended to
modulus and if it's PHP the devs have no

129
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,399
idea what they're doing so they just
make you some random nonsense verse so I

130
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,480
made it to a dozen for you currently
supporting PHP Java Eclipse II

131
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,199
species randomized sequel so that's a
fair Friday I plan on adding more that's

132
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,320
the future astronauts because it's kind
of a big like people think they're

133
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,839
making stuff more secure when the user's
interests which is not true so I'll

134
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,949
probably Python next and give me a bunch
of other things like into your and thats

135
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,120
foresight on github there that link will
be at the end as well so if you want to

136
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,050
take a picture of whatever you can but I
appreciate that did not reserve program

137
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,510
like using Python libraries do things so
there's also a command line interface

138
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,949
called for C which is in that same
repository so if you wanted to for

139
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:36,209
example predict the output from the R
and R function in Gillette CSIS a decent

140
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:41,410
person sharing lol I know they can
follow this with with gcc I see they're

141
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,190
using radar so I know I've got his out
what's going on with the next one as

142
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,940
well you can stop in to see liner a life
is this command line interface you say

143
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,240
40

144
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,810
and our data show in the output and give
you all of you shop with something

145
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,220
that's you know hopefully fairly handy
for you

146
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,040
PHP has you know it has like there and
function takes like an upper and lower

147
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,620
bounds even say like I want numbers
between one hundred so if you have that

148
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,570
situation just put data are 100 figure
it out if you want to limit the output

149
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,680
which you probably do because otherwise
you get that gigantic stream of school

150
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,779
and stuff for the US you can just look
at it with that the hundred and by pure

151
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,490
coincidence happy for instance during
this kind of predictability like

152
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,430
requires that you basically implement
the orangey that they are using in

153
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,680
whatever language you're using so you
can also just passes seed and get off

154
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,480
your loans if you just happened at the
scene

155
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,550
hopefully don't open it was given away
the seed but it's just a nice looking

156
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,170
out there and we'll see actually a case
where someone does get with this in a

157
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,760
second right now so examples from the
wild actual the sexual stuff that people

158
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,230
have done again I'm gonna get walk to
this something that you don't know

159
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,890
anything about code PHP good if you
carry PHP terrible so again much like to

160
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,079
see there's kind of this restaurant or
and then going on in PHP and you can see

161
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,630
today seemed random with this guy does
this real code it was not been patched

162
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:09,200
so slight break this new stuff but this
is used to generate a capture and it was

163
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,420
fairly widely use like you can have a
schedule things a little bit but like I

164
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,480
mean there were i did some searches and
it was like a few thousand websites that

165
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,770
is used this as their capture and it is
completely worthless because they go

166
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,649
okay we're gonna see the random number
generator with the time and then they

167
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:31,240
generate Randall Luthi I kinda doubt it
was a bunch of crap and they make a URL

168
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,810
which ends with the time that they used
in the sea which is not not as good as

169
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,220
problematic so you don't have to use
Python for this you can just drop the

170
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,660
thing in and there you go you just say
around and I know the seeds you put in

171
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,670
the time that they used as the seed and
you're done and I'll give you all the

172
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,959
future ones they patch this one's before
I talk to them about it they pass this

173
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,680
one's very recently and they said we're
gonna remove the seat heater and that's

174
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,860
not as dumb as AM I seeing because PHP
employees

175
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,610
around with the combination of the
processor I D in time and some stuff

176
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,920
that you can't predict but they're still
generating the values with rand which

177
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,399
means all you need to do is break one
captured by hand and you recover the

178
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,649
state of the orangey and then use
predict our future and that's like bob

179
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:21,310
one spot on so you just say basically
from your side obviously I'm poor and

180
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,260
ran from outputs and then the outputs
and it will give you all the future once

181
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,750
again that doesn't actually solve the
problem I give them another patch

182
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,649
unfortunately they want to target 55
which doesn't really have a like

183
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:37,240
built-in security things I said using
your and wishes I guess as good as you

184
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:46,790
can get there now see one that's less
bad this is used in kind of a pastebin

185
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,630
style things like you upload files and
it gives you like a URL that's that's

186
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,490
kind of the access control for the side
because like I don't people have to make

187
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,500
a counselor again but also everything's
not really public like you you can't

188
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,980
there's nothing good will I crawled out
or anything so what they do here is they

189
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,680
just call Rand ZAR and aloo and a
modulus it by the the link they've got a

190
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,089
list of these letters and they just say
we're gonna car and on his letters and

191
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,810
there's obviously some logic that I cut
out that prevents you from selecting

192
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,720
previously made obviously you could run
you could happen to generate one that

193
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,500
was already used but they were smart
enough to actually do that but clearly

194
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,360
that's actually work because all I have
to do is upload one thing see the URL

195
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,510
but I get back what letters were chosen
in our everyday R&G in the future once

196
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,310
that's again kind of a problem once a
valid one thing to the file I can

197
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,120
remember the URL of everybody else that
ever will upload it so again just see

198
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
importer and R&R from out but you're
seeing a pattern here there's a flight

199
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,720
here that you can say output module is
so if you just know the sterile and

200
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,660
that's always going to be 52 it's just
like upper and lower case letters and

201
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,980
then like there you go so you just stick
that in there in your sleep is not care

202
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:05,430
about see then so how do you prevent
prevention and this is pretty low

203
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,029
hanging fruit and you crazy like packing
their stuff and I found like race

204
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,320
conditions on their IDs and like it's
just I looked I did some get up searches

205
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,350
random shows the first few things like
everyone messes this up and I was doing

206
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:25,800
the master make them more like trying to
find a little later but the problem here

207
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,200
is that people inadvertently a lot
unpredictability I think that's like the

208
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,940
greater problem right they they don't
really think about it and they just see

209
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,560
the specs it doesn't have to be right
there is like well whatever the specs as

210
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,490
used to generate random values as gotta
be uniformly distributed across this

211
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,000
range right is not a secret anything
it's not a secret people treat like you

212
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,940
don't need YouTube Google+ Karen G

213
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,280
the problem is your implementation may
often implicitly require the

214
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,620
unpredictable for example suppose you
have a system that generates user IDs

215
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,310
within some range and just uses like
empty right reasons and 24 out but it's

216
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,260
a few but it's not like enough to
actually prevent me from recovering

217
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,300
anything so what happens when your
system's about injuries or I D I predict

218
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,760
what the user ID is going to be a nice
in your request without user IDs at the

219
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,430
same time that you're about to generate
it is there is condition I have no idea

220
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,270
probably your testers have no idea
probably no one ever tested for that

221
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,540
because that's crazy nonsense because
nobody nobody thinks about what if they

222
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,870
predict my number generator and then
they put in an idea tech like that just

223
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,610
one more convoluted nonsense but it's
like definitely doable like that's

224
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,990
that's an interesting avenue of attack
that i think is like entirely unused now

225
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,600
because people really consider the
practical is treated like an academic

226
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,620
exercise when I just close to people

227
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,490
a response that I got almost verbatim
from one person was I don't know how

228
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,050
practical that attack would be right
he's using random you'd like I'm like

229
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,750
well that's going to really easily
predictable and he says that's almost an

230
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,820
academic exercise no one really knows
like there's no tool to do that and

231
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:04,209
other is so he can I get home and I'm
going to actually after this release at

232
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:10,470
all so the the solution here is fairly
straightforward as a user you wherever

233
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,110
you can if you haven't been smart and
found out that you can use to secure our

234
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,430
energy just don't do that just using
energy and let you know that you can't

235
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,910
because seriously there's probably some
nonsense I can do with race conditions

236
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,380
or i mean

237
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,350
there's just no like you have no I think
they're so hard to test that sort of

238
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,070
thing are you gonna test like what
happens when I D as you sent that is

239
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,750
supposed to be generated a second that's
just crazy so basically a reply from

240
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,610
someone to do this is just more and more
difficult on Linux you can read from W

241
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:48,110
random an independent received your
items just better are random is like a

242
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,090
BSD thing ran devices OpenSSL round ass
on Windows apparently I'm really used it

243
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:58,360
but it's there are implications
randomized pretty fast open a cell does

244
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,210
this pretty quickly that your enemies
and fortunately the slower but I mean

245
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,080
just profiling and see what's going on I
hesitate to say it but otherwise use

246
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,600
your sister if you've been charging you
absolutely cannot use across from Sakura

247
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,460
wanna

248
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,260
twister a bunch out what's predicted has
very nice tits what characteristics so

249
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,160
that's probably your next best bet to
compare security but seriously things

250
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,990
and there's the oral bottom check it out

251
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:38,290
star things you know content they have
any questions questions I've explained

252
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:46,850
everything perfectly sure at the moment
yes but it depends on the orangey for

253
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,580
LCDs in principle you don't at all thats
Telugu version 1.1 is just that cuz it's

254
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,860
super easy is basically just you advance
the you just feel like an underscore

255
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,790
where you don't know about you and
there's no reason that one or more

256
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,660
problematic because they're just like an
array of values and it's a little weird

257
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,900
but with like LCDs and some of the other
ones it would it would be no problem at

258
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:15,740
all tonight

259
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:23,280
I would have to think about the
implications of it you could not buy

260
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,420
just trying like you could say basically
assume there's one thing between it and

261
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,630
see if it works out and i mean Iran's in
less than a second so I mean probably

262
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,090
could afford to do it you know for
assuming you have some ideas not like

263
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,120
there are a million between you know if
you know like probably the only like 10

264
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,530
or so between it for some of its I mean
you're you're basically brute forcing

265
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,900
like to do the 16 which is just like
nothing on a modern computers I mean

266
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,550
it's not a big deal to try that so
that's definitely something that kind of

267
00:19:49,550 --> 00:20:13,880
like you know less restrictive
interfaces future is very similar i

268
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,260
focused on getting like a wider range
like platform supported rather than like

269
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,600
one thing and being able to afford the
yeah for some of them you definitely can

270
00:20:22,600 --> 00:26:56,150
also go

271
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:31,000
homer in for hackers as a previous
