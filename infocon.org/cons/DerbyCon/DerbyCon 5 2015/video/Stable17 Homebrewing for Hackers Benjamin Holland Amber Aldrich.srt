1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,269
ok so I

2
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,830
coming out today and my name is Ben this
is Amber and we're talking about home

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,349
room for hackers so I want to set the
stage of what you guys should expect

4
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:27,970
today so we're here to share our
interests with the community and this is

5
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,059
definitely a break from the technical
stuff and honestly we're a little

6
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:37,989
surprised the stock even got accepted so
you know just

7
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:42,520
also said the expectations sorry no 0
days if you came to the stock expecting

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,300
0 days you probably came the wrong place
you would think we're gonna give you is

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,290
your day we think so this is how to get
a derby contact accepted so first of all

10
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,210
tell people you will give them free beer
right name drop in eighty regardless if

11
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,280
you know him or not spend but seriously
spend some time thinking about what your

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,090
submission says and spend times on an
all the parts even the parts at the you

13
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,969
know the attendees will see more so we
actually submitted we posted our

14
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:19,829
submission online if you want to read it
just to see how the stock got accepted

15
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,659
but don't rule out the stable talk sorry
there is actually no I think maybe a

16
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,479
little less competition demo something
and if you can open source something

17
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,810
that you know right up and source give
away free stuff so we have some free

18
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,829
stuff we're gonna give away today and
use Unicode voting boss and say yes to

19
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:42,689
Derby Conn hugs regardless if you want
them or not this is kind of the culture

20
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,380
here and don't be shy just submit
something you have a better chance of

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,880
getting something accepted then you
would think so quick overview of what we

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,740
talked about today we're going to learn
how to make boost so how many home

23
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,649
buyers in the crowd wow ok you guys are
awesome ok and if we say something wrong

24
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,689
I hadn't practiced ok history and legal
final talk a little bit about

25
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,359
prohibition that's what that pictures
from and then are open source project at

26
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,720
the end so we have a lot of material to
cover so we're just gonna try to keep

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,280
moving through its imma give you the
chemistry 101 right so we start with

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,560
yeast yeast is probably the most
important thing

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,140
and we're going to feed its in sugar and
that's gonna give us but is actually

30
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,080
awesome because it is alcohol and carbon
dioxide which is exactly what we wanted

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,970
beer so that's good Easter Parade and
there is actually one of man's oldest

32
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,769
inventions you know up there were like
fire and stuff and is probably just an

33
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,700
accident that we made it so making blues
is really really easy if you have a

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,340
number that's like half of you in the
crowd you can't really mess it up too

35
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,430
much all you gotta do is make it taste
good right that's what the rest of talks

36
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,180
going to be about and just click
disclaimer we're not like beer experts

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,819
or hobbyist everyone has a slight right
there's a lot of opinions on the

38
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,390
internet about the right way to do
things and people disagree fiercely and

39
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,780
what that right way to do it is there's
always room to improve probably better

40
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,370
ways of doing things and that's what
we've been doing lately but we keep

41
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,849
adapting things that keep changing
things something handed over to Amber to

42
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,260
talk about the steps of making beer ok
this is probably everyone's favorite

43
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:21,570
part so overbearing get started so good
idea is to figure out if you have

44
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,250
everything the worst part is like
getting halfway through and realizing

45
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,560
you're missing something so it's good
idea to get an idea of what you need and

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,650
have it ready to go this is just an
example of what you might find in a kid

47
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,180
you might buy online so you know how
some drywall Lakewood mall decent

48
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:44,540
picture they're actually did a start on
this one and an absence so

49
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,190
standardization is one the most
important things because you want your

50
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:56,450
used to win do not use soap soap is
really bad for beer we used stars and

51
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,430
because it's worked really well for us
some people use bleach I don't know how

52
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,290
that works and so there's a couple
different ideas but stars and seems to

53
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,220
work really well for us another thing
don't use scotch pads you open up when

54
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,230
you put scratches and you get bacteria
that ruins everything it can get it out

55
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,190
so another thing that we really don't
only think about is clean up right away

56
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,590
don't let things sit overnight just
clean up right away it's so much easier

57
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:31,910
sanitization is so important because
there's you surround us at all times

58
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:41,760
while these get sent you go get the same
type of beer so yes i'm ok just a pro

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,850
tip if you ever end up getting sucked
into a time vortex and end up having to

60
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,380
live the rest of your life out in the
middle agers don't drink the water right

61
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,490
but you're predator probably better off
drinking some beer wine and hard

62
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:01,650
questions you guys is why they think ya
kills bacteria so you wanna come up and

63
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:26,780
get a beer get only got a week so these
are these kids we made contact you get a

64
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,750
$200 honorarium so we decided we might
as well get that back to the community

65
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,900
and we made these kids these are kids
that we decided we thought were all the

66
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,630
proper ingredients and equipment you
would need for one downstairs so and

67
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:51,020
they also come with everything you need
to make so start boiling process you

68
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:57,320
know actually getting it to a full boil
but really close so little more water

69
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,849
results in better utilization it's
always a good idea to read the

70
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:08,070
directions that this step that way you
don't miss anything because this step

71
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,750
there are I read a lot of it and invent
out of the wrong the whole time so we

72
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:23,099
actually do that even the grain so the
bag handbag idea is to tie the greenback

73
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:26,400
the side of the shuttle that way you can
get it out without scratching your

74
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,270
fingers to cancel all three about 10
nice thing about during the boil sticks

75
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,060
the Lakewood mall in some hot water in
the same it's a lot easier to poor you

76
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,530
because spoon in there and try to escape
it all out just pours all out so warm up

77
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,560
take up the pot off the boiler before
you jump ball in there that way you

78
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
don't score sheet on the bottom is good
idea to like have some one person

79
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,639
staring right now and then the other
person for i Touring then you answered

80
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:06,480
and the bottom and at this point you
have to work and so now we boil it this

81
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,950
is what we call the danger zone because
we've let it boil over a couple times so

82
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:20,080
yeah and and it's a mess to clean up
kind of a pain so can keep an eye on it

83
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:38,050
for the first pass it kind of calmed
down after that so so hot he put in is

84
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,740
battering hard so that's kind of the
flavor the better part of that you're

85
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,479
tasting and towards the end you're gonna
add a Roma cops more than smell getting

86
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,970
off that kind of used to have a few
skill just because a lot of times they

87
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,850
give you a one ounce packages and
sometimes you have like half an ounce

88
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,640
star within a half an hour later and
sometimes they also give you a little

89
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,240
extra they don't normally sure you on
tops so it's a little something kinda

90
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,600
headed that way you have the exact
amount that's not too important though

91
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,190
cooling at area eating so if you want to
take a really long time

92
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,229
ice and water in the sink and let it sit
for a really fun time I wore to her is

93
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,210
really handy and cut the time down to
maybe 20 minutes tops so it just runs

94
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:32,789
hot cold water pipe in there and at this
point everything that touches the war

95
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,080
must be completely sanitary so they are
saying is tiny and at this point

96
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,380
especially the spray bottle just pray
everything so we're getting ready for

97
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,540
primary fermentation EC's oxygen to live
so we need to dump we just dump it into

98
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,460
the container is Justine bubbles

99
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:57,200
you're probably getting pretty good area
Shin also gonna wanna get up to a

100
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,500
certain value initially started about
three gallons in the kennel to say it's

101
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,380
not feasible due five gallons and there
it is too heavy to move around but your

102
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,160
dad too much water because we're trying
to get too specific starting gravity

103
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:18,180
original need and this is a reader
you're reading at the blows in this case

104
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,760
you're trying to get it this is just
reading how much sugar is in there and

105
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,250
so you have on your she how much or what
it needs to be at you just add water to

106
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:35,110
get it up there but we are to do you
start which is like doing a little

107
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,840
microbrew beforehand

108
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,550
normally we just dumb the dry yeast in
there we've never had a nice start so

109
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,720
it's worked out pretty well for us and
of course if you forget the easter is no

110
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,590
beer and then of course you need to keep
everything else out in your gonna let

111
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:59,490
co2 how but not less oxygen and so
you're going to use we've been using

112
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:07,770
lately for that process for letting her
feeling the airline don't use water you

113
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,350
get infection this possibility of it is
sometimes the air temperature might

114
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,900
change and it might pull someone some of
what's in the air lock into your brew so

115
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:24,530
it's good idea to use our sandwiches at
the Easter for you in quantities for all

116
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:33,390
others in this can actually see that
it's bubbling away this is actually the

117
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,900
next morning so it does not take very
long it's been a couple days and you

118
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,370
don't see anything there's something
wrong you need to look into it a good

119
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,970
idea is to remember if you put Houston
it and it doesn't take very long to get

120
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:53,970
and now you have the flag there so we do
you normally do a secondary fermentation

121
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,630
but at this stage you could technically
bottle it and drink it shortly after

122
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,300
that

123
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:07,260
but mainly due to secondary is get rid
of the crowd and daddy's the bottom so

124
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:13,620
that this free article this part is also
an idea you've gotten into like many

125
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,430
other things into it so late putting
opine oaks in their suburban at this

126
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:25,110
point for you or do dry hopping you like
more hops in there at this point allies

127
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,279
does a lot of alcohol in it so you don't
have to worry about it being so clean so

128
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:37,860
it's a good idea but like dry hot seat
only gonna take another hydrometer

129
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:47,370
reading this is formulated by the end of
a nice idea that sometimes it varies

130
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:54,750
widely we've done stuff like 67 percent
now we have stuff that the second

131
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,839
formula is far higher gravity stuff
we've had a lot of we've gotten into

132
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:06,920
doing lines and stuff so it's little
better formula for the idea in

133
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:14,279
coordinating so we not only do bottling
that Kagan's and easy natural

134
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,860
carbonation with the bottling so you
just giving you some food and then those

135
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,360
plates and co2 inside the bottle it
takes a little while for that to build

136
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,760
up inside bottle so you have two or
three weeks taking center for co2 you

137
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,279
have a little less time you have to wait
it's cheaper for balls because a lot of

138
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,589
you probably drink beer here and if you
just hold onto the bottles that are not

139
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,610
twist offs you can reuse this possum out
lol

140
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,519
know more about work with bottles
because you have to sanitize all of them

141
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,070
and then you also had the chance bottle
bombs we've never had one blow up

142
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,350
because the headspace is so important

143
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,990
air compresses much better than likely
so if you need some head stays in there

144
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,649
you can press there and you don't have
to worry about bottle bomb but sometimes

145
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,880
they happen you might have our
formulation finish it in time so good

146
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,370
idea is we put everything in a plastic
tub if one blows up its in the tub

147
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:18,720
its easy cleanup class ever and and of
course use case and in course you know

148
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:26,260
it's repeat the entire process now you
have you started so we've kind of gotten

149
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:36,079
bigger missing missing something we've
gotten into doing wine in me too which

150
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:43,130
is honey 10 wireless equipment you can
use to make wines and root beer so does

151
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:50,510
so the thing I like about wine though
especially high in mind was my favorite

152
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,810
there's there's less experienced you
have a little more play on what you want

153
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,899
to make I've made up my own recipes at
this point with the honey I because I

154
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:04,290
don't have to worry about its little
less ingredients and so I just pick out

155
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,410
a through road in with some water a
couple other chemicals to make sure it

156
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,459
breaks down properly and then the only
other thing is pH is kind of a little

157
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:21,199
more critical test their assets and
fruit and the help of easter is also up

158
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,779
there more because he does have complex
sugars are simple sugars and so it's

159
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,250
hard to break down and so they don't
have as much you to sort out all headed

160
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:36,470
back over defense personal history ok so
they're not there was a time when we

161
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,740
couldn't be true in the us- and most
people call this provision but it was

162
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,510
also called the noble experiment

163
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,240
in this was because at the time the
sentiment was that drinking was becoming

164
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,820
this nationwide coverage right and there
was a lot of lobbying by the answer I

165
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,500
saloon League the women's Christian
Temperance Union and quite a few other

166
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,840
dry advocates believe also the KKK was
an advocate of not drinking which may be

167
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,040
surprising but the actually I mean this
the Sino turned into something that

168
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,050
Congress ratified is the 18th amendment
and then the next day

169
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:18,090
prohibition was in place and prohibition
bans the manufacture sale or transport

170
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,410
of intoxicating liquors and note that
that doesn't mean that it was actually

171
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,830
illegal to drink it was just that you
can manufacturers or transported and

172
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,510
intoxicating liquors was intentionally
vague term at the time because they

173
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:39,990
decided that the state and federal laws
would redefine that and this also allows

174
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,600
for scientific industrial and religious
uses of alcohol so most people thought

175
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,340
that this just meant hard hard liquor
right you're you're you're whiskeys and

176
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,930
we actually saw things like beer
industry's advocating for prohibition

177
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,070
and if you're wondering why it's because
it's eliminating the competition right

178
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,020
everyone's gotta drink beer now and so
it makes sense until the Volstead Act

179
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,460
came along to enforce provision and the
act is named after a more steady which

180
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,850
was the leader of the Anti Saloon league
who had a much stricter definition of

181
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,210
what intoxicating liquors would be and
has actually turned out to be anything

182
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:24,920
about half a percent right so the
question at this point and so we see

183
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,530
things like businesses getting creative
which is kind of a fun way to get around

184
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,560
provision right so if you're an alcohol
business dinner provision how do you

185
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,600
survive so easy and neither bush starts
making soft drinks I because all the

186
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,760
same equipment but they also start
selling brewers yeast and homework it's

187
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,720
right because it's illegal to homebrew
but it's not illegal to sell the

188
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,520
ingredients so same same thing along
lines

189
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,560
wine vineyard start so in what they
called praising cakes and these are

190
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,520
raising cakes came with a fun little
warnings like do not let these raisins

191
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,540
soaked in water do not let this water so
in judge for 21 days otherwise

192
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,300
fermentation mayor right and so this is
actually a picture of a card that would

193
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,050
come in a box of raisins and this one's
even much more explicit it's just

194
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,339
instructions directly how to make wine
from those grades so totally legal

195
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,930
people just can't get there on the ways
and if you had this idea in your mind if

196
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,750
you haven't tried homebrewing you might
wonder like am I gonna go blind gonna do

197
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,940
something to make me go blind short
answer is no and that's because we have

198
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,870
the stereotype prohibition about all
these people getting sick and dying from

199
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:35,900
all this underground and really that's
because there is wood alcohol which is

200
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,370
methanol ethanol is the alcohol we like
methanol is not the alcohol like right

201
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:46,380
and methanol is incredibly toxic in fact
when you start to metabolize it your

202
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:52,670
body it turns first into formaldehyde
and in second in to formic acid yeah

203
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,890
which is very dangerous to the human
nervous system so this is made by

204
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,450
distilling would which just seems like a
bad idea in the first place it tastes

205
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:06,000
just like alcohol so you can't tell the
difference it looks like alcohol and the

206
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,900
entries I know which group it was but
the industrial industries had to start

207
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,660
denaturing industrial alcohol so people
wouldn't just by industrial alcohol and

208
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,970
drink that and one of the early ways
that they did that was by putting

209
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,780
methanol in it right so it became a very
deadly poison to people and then we also

210
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,940
saw people to making wood alcohol and
selling it to these kind of unregulated

211
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,710
underground markets and that became
incredibly toxic effects two spoonfuls

212
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,850
enough to kill a dog and all now and
then this kind of became a game of

213
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,230
tennis denaturing and Henry nature
industrial alcohols and they kept kind

214
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:51,240
of playing a game of making deadlier and
denaturing agents that the chemist had

215
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,170
trouble free nature in the alcohol again
and if you are rich person during the

216
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,300
time you don't really have to worry
because either bought from a country

217
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,269
club which was

218
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:04,080
allowed to restock a whole bunch of
alcohol before provision went to cause

219
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,950
it's not illegal to drink it if you
bought it before thats ok or you a drink

220
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,849
with the chemistry and the chemist would
drink first and he didn't die you're

221
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,330
safe to go ahead and drink but if you're
a poor person you don't have that luxury

222
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:21,119
Mandarin provision there's only a market
for hard stuff probably cuz it's easier

223
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,679
to transport a small network within a
large amount of liquid and if you drink

224
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,719
something you probably drank a lot of it
in fact the the amount of just plain old

225
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:34,469
regular alcohol-related skyrocketed
during provision more and more people

226
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:39,070
were drinking during probation before
provision drinking in a bar was kind of

227
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,320
like a slow and kinda old west it's a
lonely place but now it's an unregulated

228
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,679
undergone market women and children and
drinking that changed the whole drinking

229
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,989
thing so kind of an interesting time
period

230
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:54,649
home rented a home Bruins totally legal
today in all 50 states Prohibition was

231
00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:58,719
repealed in 1933 went into effect in
nineteen 19 meanwhile women got the

232
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:02,159
right to vote and they changed the
presidential term to begin in January

233
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:08,029
instead of people I don't care about
that point but anyway so the state laws

234
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:11,379
vary widely so something you still need
to know because state law still play

235
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:15,799
over the federal laws Alemany Alabama
and Mississippi actually legalized

236
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,919
gambling in 2013 so that you know it's
just finally caught up actually wanted

237
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:31,549
to hold true so yes so you have to do it
in so you're limited to 200 gallons per

238
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:36,119
year per person that really up to 200
gallons per household so if you can

239
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,299
drink that much go for it but that's
quite a few homering cannot be sold so

240
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:45,059
we can't sell your home bring you need a
license to own or operate distillation

241
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:50,119
equipment but getting that way since is
actually pretty easy from what I've

242
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:56,209
heard so if your interest in that just
pursue getting a license first now we

243
00:20:56,209 --> 00:21:00,409
have another question for you guys and
this one has a reward so if you can't

244
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:04,209
legally distill alcohol and they distill
alcohol I mean boil it captured the

245
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:07,080
vapor condenses it and then save that
alcohol

246
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:20,460
how it's good you create a hard liquor
you are ok yes yeah but that's that's

247
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:40,779
the regular distillation ok yeah yeah
definitely got it over here and we got a

248
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:46,059
week so they get a couple ways
definitely not legal advice you're

249
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:50,110
probably still get in trouble if you try
to do it and so whatever but you can try

250
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,510
to freeze concentrated depending how
fast you can get you can actually get

251
00:21:53,510 --> 00:22:00,570
between like 15 90% and another way you
could try is by picking a high yield use

252
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,730
that kind of resistance alcohol or by
adding sugar as in keeping the East

253
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,760
healthy and then you're kind of
artificially selecting the healthy East

254
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:16,610
so that's not going to get as much but
you can we've made meet up to 18% and

255
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,440
hopefully would be kinda cool to go
further so eventually if you bring

256
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,970
enough beers you can find yourself
saying OK we need a better system and

257
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,570
this is a conversation with a friend and
he kind of said something along the

258
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:33,289
lines of you know we should really start
labeling things and by we I mean you and

259
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:37,139
that's just because I have all these
bottles around and I try to color code

260
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:41,299
the caps but eventually you can start
recycling the colors in the caps anyway

261
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:47,169
you want kind of a system to record your
measurements and automatically computer

262
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,100
alcohol content because he's taking his
measurements I don't have to run the

263
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,460
calculations every single time someone
asked me how much alcohol is in this

264
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,419
year and the system that we bill
actually is

265
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:03,500
version control with get and it's a web
page that hosted for free

266
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,350
and will the plane just about five
minutes all you have to do is go the

267
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:13,110
project for the project and then added a
few files you can add each grew by

268
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,280
adding a markdown file so markdowns very
easy to edit by hand it all through the

269
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,020
web browser and get its just a clean
simple theme is based off jekyll and

270
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,550
supports a custom domain name and is
customizable so this is our Open Source

271
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:36,390
project I'll just pull it up because we
have just a few minutes ok so if you go

272
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,130
to the home page you can see all of our
brews we've done quite a few here

273
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:45,830
however overheat alcohol content here
and then shows you that calculation and

274
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,530
our measurements you can jump to each of
these are the last Monday brewed I

275
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,840
messed up the order is amber said
because I was taking too many pictures

276
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,720
but anyway this is kind of fun way you
can add comments and stuff so if you

277
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,260
guys are looking for something like this
it's free just for project ok so I think

278
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,820
that's all we have to say definitely
thank you guys for coming out this is a

279
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,560
huge audience for a very non technical
subject and I think that hacking and

280
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,650
bribery is kind of a win as evidence of
half the audiences into that and if

281
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,150
you're kinda internet there's two other
conferences you may want to check out

282
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,650
there's one in Belgium colebrook on
which is all about brain and tech

283
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:30,320
packing and then there's one in Chicago
and they hold him bring competition at a

284
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,140
bar so that kind of thing and if you
guys want these slides there up on our

285
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,920
sites and happy take any questions and
you guys might be wondering this will

286
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,700
mark it let's see if you guys look under
your seats someone has something taped

287
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:55,220
to the bottom of their seat and if no
one finds it over to differences

288
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:30,590
somewhere in the middle of some chance
to win first yes so it just uses the

289
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,650
basic equation right now which is i mean
both equations are within a tenth of a

290
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:40,720
percent of each other but yeah you can I
mean it's it's you can add more

291
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,730
measurement categories if you want so we
added one on my say and my my fourth

292
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:51,690
semester which requires the that PHP
stuff because we didn't have that for

293
00:25:51,690 --> 00:26:05,389
beer is normally you are ready within
the right through the east but yeah

294
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:19,969
yeah yeah so we can I mean what's on
master the basic thing and kinda meme

295
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:22,979
that beer but it's got just basically
the regional final
