1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:54,410
this year

2
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,980
awesome awesome now I know there are a
number of other really good and

3
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,090
interesting talks going on dealing with
security however today and this

4
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,990
particular talk to me so much focus on
that however you could use this tool to

5
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,130
teach security tools Linux based ones
anyway so let's get started so money's

6
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,080
John ship I worked at the National
Center for supercomputing applications

7
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm on the security operations team I
play with cool tools like broke because

8
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,680
her bro the runner screenwriter alright
bro is an excellent tool urkel I mean

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,549
number of contributions and other
projects and work on the next defense

10
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:39,490
and security of also in the founder of
the open number security monitor as

11
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:45,360
anybody heard that awesome so it's a
weekly in December that is available 21

12
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,909
here in us and we talked about bro snore
cercano whatever number of projects

13
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,229
going on the road all day like a malware
analysis using doctors trainers are

14
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,520
hunting foxes and the continuous and
project which is taking all the innocent

15
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,110
ones that we can find major version
minor releases its container as

16
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,780
intimidating available online to make
them down to research comparisons

17
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:19,920
how do anybody able to contribute to the
crux of the problem with training that

18
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,920
is I T training isn't easy right

19
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,240
there's a lot of stuff that goes into it
when you're a trainer you have to set up

20
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,810
training environments music typically
involves Virtual Machine bus common

21
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,819
conferences have been a lot of
conferences where the pass around you a

22
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,890
virtual machines or prior the day before

23
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,790
hey download the stuff and have the
application installed the virtual

24
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,510
machine in your enemy at the conference
so one problem with this is it takes

25
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,730
time to actually go out and do this
you're putting the work on the user what

26
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,019
if we kind of took that off and let the
attachment do this work we were able to

27
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,190
make this in a way of reading have to
distribute these large p.m. files when

28
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,920
she know her gigabytes also network
conditions to slow especially on hotel

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,190
networks on such short transforms into a
long time and I've been a congress where

30
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,630
the past around USB stick right so you
have a beach N USB sticks around 200

31
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,100
people it takes time to copy that and
one comfort I went to it took an hour

32
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,450
but I'm just a setup for the training so
this is the problem that I'm trying to

33
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,730
address so common types of I T train
just to give you an overview include

34
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,410
shared system training in this example
this is at work where they have any

35
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,350
cluster there is a login note and
everybody wants to learn how to do some

36
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:45,980
say OpenMP er multi parallel programming
so they would have another compiler on

37
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,120
their the library to OpenMP libraries
and they give her body use Council the

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,120
admin prior to the event has to use one
you need to go in and pipes and other

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,620
counts as the passwords do it will have
a piece of paper with a piece of paper

40
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,430
round with a username and the password
that's all random for everybody to use

41
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,739
that takes time to a great you can
automate that in some ways such as you

42
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,239
listen to script it up but there's a
comes a problem of isolation move along

43
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,730
the virtual machine churning again

44
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:23,320
machines are big they're slow so this is
the third one is the one that I'm kind

45
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,180
of work and this is called container
tree so I'm sure nice here are some of

46
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,520
you are familiar with Linux based
containers such as the doctor

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,390
implementation alexei

48
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,950
systems like the BSU jails ALRC of songs

49
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,050
partitions etc just a way to provide
some sort of operating system-level

50
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:48,740
virtualization and there is the final
one web based training so called go lang

51
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,500
has a nice interactive web-based
trainings are used that the tools that

52
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,830
you tried I heard a word that is a web
interface that essentially a duck dr.

53
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,010
back and she's lunch containers the user
in a few types of scripts into the web

54
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,910
browser to get executed and then through
the results are returned to the right

55
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:19,110
web browser do training so to summarize
what we just talked about so far this

56
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,140
really easy for most importantly the
users will be sure the train also for

57
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,020
the admins so since I haven't been for a
long time security work etc

58
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,650
to make things easy so that's why
designs told that we talked about

59
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,590
shortly so what is very easy to install
deploy and configure also

60
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,120
user interface where you know minimum
requirements are there so we make the

61
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,170
Bears haven't read very low and we can
do this by not having them hypervisors

62
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:54,630
not having any other software that may
be needed we stored on the server in

63
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:01,970
some way I leaves the isolated scalable
and lightweight environment for training

64
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:09,210
is a system that uses doctor training
environments officially users

65
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,460
so different use cases primarily is used
for adventuring you can also use it for

66
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,479
research company training other things
like just just trying things out

67
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:27,400
times on campus and available niggas
goin login and you will have to install

68
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,520
their machine they can just use the
Windows client that can happen to all

69
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,430
these already prepared environments so
the first real world use case of this

70
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,380
was launched at broke on 14 and this is
actually the year prior to her consort

71
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,430
he's the one I lose you previously and
that was the conference like an hour to

72
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,160
transfer all the stuff so it would start
team so broken 14 came around here like

73
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,680
I do something different and then some
of the game I chose the hey I think I

74
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,780
can handle this problem I can try to
solve it myself so we had plus users all

75
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,830
talked into this one system is a medium
system on Dec 20 when they get to the

76
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,960
venue just as a sage this user name at
this host login or my shares the same

77
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,889
password in because we knew isolation in
their own little environments and looked

78
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,169
out very well we had some issues with
the wireless connectivity but other than

79
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,719
that the training system our time and
energy plus users running bro code all

80
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:32,210
running through pcap files you know
german the log events that happened on

81
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,080
the networks those illegal also been
used in the University of Illinois Tool

82
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,820
forensics to the trainers contacted me
and they were using it there teach the

83
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,509
students tools like volatility and other
memory in forensic tools some

84
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:51,080
disgruntled as well and a user

85
00:07:51,080 --> 00:08:00,539
gerdes so what about this is that once
you have using this tool because doctor

86
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:06,580
provides a lot of record standouts in
her care of everything in a container

87
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,539
even record that you can use it to go
back to what the users

88
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:15,159
instructor you know you have them do
their stuff and then Ashley events

89
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,780
commands and see where they made
mistakes or what what they did wrong

90
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,490
button at the top in committing
currently making incorrect configuration

91
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,550
file changes etc

92
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:31,830
hauling the best information and
training for future helps you solve

93
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,620
problems with your training with you can
make things more clearly you can see

94
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:44,079
them that we're writing down some of the
design of the law so are the technology

95
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:53,240
behind it specifically I'm using the
doctor implementation support that was

96
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,990
so everything's isolation because you
like karl has these things called

97
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:07,949
namespace can tell the difference
between universal machine was there in a

98
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:13,269
container and with his name spaces in
quite some sort of resource control her

99
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:17,050
her training instance that is personal
trainer

100
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:26,600
thousands of instances of containers on
one system design research on that later

101
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,000
also very lightweight heard the term
just enough operating system right so

102
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,310
for example that Debian Ubuntu image you
won't even have man or chrome and a very

103
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,460
light way these things you need

104
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:47,360
also we just used to provide job because
it's everybody's most amusing to

105
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
interact with these tools that we use in
training security training I T training

106
00:09:50,720 --> 00:10:01,440
so westerners again this is about how
powerful this is becoming so doctor

107
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,350
their doctors really kind of set the
momentum for this technology containers

108
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,590
have been detected the building blocks
of them named species groups have been

109
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:16,860
in the latest kernel for seven-plus
years right but in the past 34 years a

110
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,080
linear growth people like reasonable
trans imagine they're removing a later

111
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,920
slight that the number of people that
are gonna look searching for this

112
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,780
technology arrested in the search
searched transcripts growing so you can

113
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,220
see that more people using this in their
DevOps day-to-day activities hosting web

114
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:44,160
applications etcetera which really good
training this is doctors are you know a

115
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,400
lot of features and stuff all the time
and they're always pushing the limits on

116
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,430
what can be done

117
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,140
it's a very easy to use platform for
this kind of stuff on the other tools

118
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:04,400
like alexei harder to get things going
to use it provides a unified system on a

119
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,930
little technical information which
actually covered some of it already but

120
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,140
it's important to know that there is no
container specification right so in the

121
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,960
world the linux-based containers to
refer to it the distance the technology

122
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,740
in general as you have a doctor at dr.
implementation you have Google's let me

123
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,939
contain that for you

124
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:29,149
you have the LXD implementation and the
other ones for example OpenVZ was prior

125
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:33,429
to these an OpenVZ is a is a
custom-built you can download installing

126
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,869
system where they have their own
container system has a few other ones

127
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:42,389
out there a way to containers do again
we provide lightweight process

128
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:46,769
virtualization also known as operating
system virtualization she don't need

129
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:49,259
when comparing this to the virtual
machines you don't need to do all the

130
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:54,779
hardware construction translation for
the different and enact neo accessing

131
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,619
the hypervisor from the call center up
to minimize that because you're sharing

132
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:02,779
the same colonel among the containers so
when you access a resource you would

133
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,929
open up a right system call are open to
whatever he's talking to the colonel in

134
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:11,489
the host response that efficiently as
his running application there were in

135
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:15,519
the virtual machine will experience a
lot more bulk if they made the call the

136
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:22,339
kernel into the hypervisor and then back
so this is more or transactions so

137
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:27,659
research moment here there's a paper
published by IBM performance comparison

138
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:35,539
report between doctor and KVM so KVM is
a hypervisor on Linux and what they

139
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:40,769
found was almost every single case which
was testing a memory intensity stop disk

140
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:46,779
use us a memory or like my sequel just
where they're trying right real fast

141
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,589
sequential random etcetera between
virtual machines new things to doctor in

142
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:55,329
almost every case they found the doctor
was or has exceeded the performance in

143
00:12:55,329 --> 00:13:00,979
that area surprised you recommend
checking out so I actually work on a

144
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:08,649
paper about this to an Indian csar
September 30 Directorate organization is

145
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:11,989
always a lead on the paper the primary
author of work with a display called it

146
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:17,639
a top I T all the pro team and we use
the road never security monitor as a way

147
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:24,279
to test how well it can be used in
training environments

148
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,480
so the architecture of this looks like
this you have the whole system which is

149
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,329
the largest bloc in there and in between
you have the island block which account

150
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,560
manager in the configuration as well as
some cleanup stuff so when I can

151
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,420
accomplish advantage over you want the
user account information etc and the

152
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,980
other doctor component which island
called makes call the doctors and

153
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,069
doctors the one that pretty much all the
work

154
00:13:52,069 --> 00:14:01,490
essentially so talk about the speed and
efficiency especially well simply

155
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:07,180
starting up a container shipping takes
around a quarter of a century after

156
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,819
thousand registered a virtual machine so
with this weekend a user to log in a

157
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:20,149
system ILS system and just like that
just like that so it's really cool and

158
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:31,889
really quickly let's do so we have to
have a mono test and I'm using a talk

159
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:35,740
abou to doctor now it's called the
doctor told box for you can download

160
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,470
this is but stalker engine virtual
machine installed client under Hosni can

161
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,329
make doctor calls directly on your
bureau ostensibly to the original shape

162
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:55,699
we have a number of images going on here
in a bigger way that you may be so

163
00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:02,029
number of images I have going on here so
now we're going to Dr for I am just run

164
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:12,540
instances are typing understanding up to
your doctor in the world you are as the

165
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:19,620
Debian image of a Debian images and
we're gonna say run but time and time it

166
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,510
takes is one bad ass

167
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:33,760
about one second to washing container
with the past process exit so that's

168
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,430
pretty efficient compared to see working
with the spinning of environments

169
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:45,630
virtual machines are described apps and
the next live shows between these by the

170
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,780
way these pictures right now they're
saying there are people that we've

171
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:55,720
published so you can see here we have a
thousand containers at the most running

172
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,060
top alright up at the same time so you
can see a compared to like when you

173
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,920
consider that on the actual host without
the container system the isolation of

174
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,320
that stuff is very efficient so you can
run things just to prove that you can

175
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,880
run multiple are thousands of instances
of training environments at the same

176
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,890
time imagine doing training at scale
right so deeply subculture 200 people

177
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:25,230
maybe a hundred people or a history of
thousands but whenever they actually the

178
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,920
workshop only certain people sign up but
what if you could do like MOOCs you know

179
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,550
massive online courses when you could
use some to like this to you can take

180
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,420
years for a large amount of people talk
hundreds of thousands or even millions

181
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:43,010
you can scale horizontally hopefully
we'll work on a hurdle scalability

182
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:49,650
implementation to analysts the paper so
what we did was we simulate isn't

183
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,150
raining gotta figure out what is the
measure is the best measure we can use

184
00:16:53,150 --> 00:17:00,050
to decide whether something is too slow
and for US supplies in the user a level

185
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,950
of patience that they have whenever
they're training so we said it took

186
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,900
about two seconds to put 13 seconds to
run bro through a common exercise pcap

187
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,110
file that the use it

188
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:19,380
training and we said well hind that
amounts up above six a set of six

189
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,850
seconds that is too much for the user to
run that looked at the data begins to

190
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,670
slowly work

191
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,820
so we said at what point are we able to
on a specific machine specific system

192
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,190
requirements are able to actually say
that this is a cock like this is a point

193
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,730
where he had more harvard is taking
longer than that six seconds right on

194
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:50,570
bro and we do this by simulating 10
minutes of user activity in the shell

195
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,760
scripts that look twenty times then
totaling roughly 10 mins user activity

196
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,330
and this was heidi was very active user
activity there are going to dredge

197
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:05,660
restructuring arrange pickup as the
church's etcetera and my experience so

198
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:11,350
far to play these things it's not it's
not that after people stopped to listen

199
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:16,810
to the people of instructor depaz the
comeback trail the command center but

200
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:22,730
this is just heavy heavy usage and
actually perform very well the blue

201
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,230
dotted line that comes across is so
whenever the red line gets above here

202
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,050
were saying at that point we should
actually had more resources even see the

203
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:39,320
bottom hundred and twenty years a number
of users that we were simulated so about

204
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,740
a hundred and twenty restricted really
get above that line keeps growing so

205
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,470
here we can actually start adding more
resources and then so we can have more

206
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:55,170
bro users working at the same time the
idea so imagine a virtual machine for

207
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,240
everybody 11 systems class of twenty
what you can do this fairly small

208
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,470
virtual machine easy to for example a
media machine probably get away with the

209
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:10,300
cost cost comparison you can see the
linear growth of the virtual machine

210
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,270
nation versus versus what you're doing
with you islet he has some jumps there

211
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:26,190
so you can actually end up costing me to
point things for a large number on some

212
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,620
now read more into

213
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:34,990
more interesting so first of all doctors
only available the doctor engine the

214
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,270
stuff that actually works with the
kernel to create these environments is

215
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,130
only available online shoppers because
the wire season two features the links

216
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,050
again

217
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:51,750
namespaces seekers controllers pilots
development done it on W I recommend

218
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,850
this almost always when I used but
everything should be just as well if you

219
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,760
wanted to work on FreeBSD your OS can
you can use the doctor toolbox future

220
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,750
doctor and was recent port supports
turnout previously there are some people

221
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,210
that unofficially pored over doctor so
it seems to me she could probably get to

222
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:17,960
work with that the underlying things
course not only thing but it's using ZFS

223
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,520
in jails on the previous

224
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,910
acquire mileage you can get at the store
all right here

225
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,300
holdouts nuclear posture be able to
everyone

226
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:38,210
configuration of actually using simple
it is all you have to do is treat a

227
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,370
configuration file in Creek Dr image the
configuration file you just drop it in

228
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:48,820
txt Island Records three-step process
really and points to complete up to

229
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:55,820
launch the training environment
configuration file find out what images

230
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,110
and lodges are mentally inside the
container

231
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,960
very simple three-step process is drop
configuration files in the directory as

232
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,490
long as you built the images that
consideration files references you're

233
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,460
good to go

234
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:28,230
also try to meet up these very easy
update and now so so this is an easy to

235
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:34,940
host this today and i install doctor
Andy Murray go through the whole thing

236
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:44,040
so yes I can thank you very much for
saying that I got let me just

237
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:53,990
uncertainty in her ways to get it all
right so we're going to eat salad

238
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:04,000
rectory and we have a config ok so did
not find some things so things it needs

239
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,790
are make you said no not found and
secretly installed doctor because it

240
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:29,260
takes and we have everything we need
there this is actually above just ignore

241
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:38,780
this right now is actually in your dog
so now we're going to make using a

242
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,390
number of things you can do so the most
important ones to make install the

243
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:52,510
software so go ahead do that it's a
stall and configuration files over

244
00:22:52,510 --> 00:23:00,360
Christmas directories available outside
make sure you want to use your config

245
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,740
file it needs a user to buy into the
county beyond that we do it simply by

246
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,650
typing

247
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:16,820
make good money was gone and training of
our training but I like it simple

248
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:25,240
that is democrat user can call general
island group democrats now we added the

249
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,740
demo account to the other and the demo
account to the doctor so at this point

250
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:38,600
we can continue but I want to show that
there are a few other options one is

251
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,820
security configuration go ahead and play
them so I love is a scriptable actually

252
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,700
configure SSH at a level that makes a
secure works with eyelet such as cutting

253
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,520
off the port forwarding so user can just
attach the container with a cessation of

254
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,440
traffic and stuff so we do we do that

255
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,640
also there's a nice helpful make target
called installed a stalker so if you

256
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,430
don't have installed a stalker and then
after that was pulling down the latest

257
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:11,630
version of doctor from doctors on
repositories so the security config

258
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:22,560
thank you so much time I spend as root
alright so far so now at this point we

259
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:30,450
can connect to it let's go ahead and
order this terminal window do actually

260
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:43,180
this is a new terminal window

261
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:59,900
and the past and we're usually no no
need to account management so now we're

262
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,590
here

263
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,840
press the key to continue and we can see
that there's a few things we also have

264
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,010
to do I actually read a tweet recently
out of this before it into this with

265
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,960
this actually make some of the more
secure with the permission so we don't

266
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:24,320
have to do some suitable she considers
the cops so we're gonna do now exactly

267
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:45,670
what to do now we're gonna do so I
thought it was just at this permission

268
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:55,620
ok so now we have another issue is the
doctor stories back and now this is

269
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,050
another recent problems

270
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,890
packages are they changed the back and
so we're gonna have to set in islet @

271
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:14,090
yahoo.com so it's really simple to do
and see that there's a backhander into

272
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,180
this whole thing is this is easier I
mean a lot of changes recently so far

273
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,850
more problem a great now I didn't
prepare for the super well but now you

274
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:30,130
know as you watch me you can handle all
of this so the story is backing from the

275
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,420
doctors that it improves change a new
release every month and half my shits

276
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,100
broken like I have to go and I have to
check this working and I keep reading

277
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,200
process and here is another instance of
where I have to go and change the back

278
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,870
in and around but you love it I do love
him very much

279
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:57,460
Arkansas doctor info actually tells the
back in the US using aus aren't so we'll

280
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:22,690
just go ahead and show you a simple scan
national

281
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:28,910
the point where the user can do stuff
again so are you a new user yes my name

282
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:39,260
is well knew my name is John John s John
ship which is a patchwork of the users

283
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,640
create their own accounts they held
their own account management there are

284
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,559
presented with the islet menu at this
point gives a few options to restart the

285
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,050
user you can tell your training
environment so don't have to have any

286
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,150
training at this point so

287
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:01,370
trimming training images so we go back
to the server for those that like NSM

288
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:14,170
tools I have a nice little make target
so now we're going to do is as much a

289
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:26,360
little gems in the big files to and this
is going to actually start building

290
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:33,350
giving giving us samples to work with
her training environments such as also

291
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:39,010
files file looks like I let you will see
that there's a bunch of stuff here so

292
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:49,450
let's learn about 400 go to this
configuration

293
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:56,510
image so we have to have this image but
in this case

294
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,880
automatically check the image exists on
doctor for you so it's looking for the

295
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:09,679
official bro platform bro live in class
bro / alive you would actually have that

296
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,669
image and you can also see here because
she said number of variables for the

297
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:18,210
containing such as limiting the CBS
shares the amount of memory the swap

298
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,429
space mount points etc whatever you want
to do to limit the user so this then go

299
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:29,010
back out and then go into our students
session again I'm a student I'm walking

300
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:35,250
into the other systems the structure
used a male demos account past and now

301
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:44,269
an existing user John ask john has now
have training environments same time we

302
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,159
drop a file in the etiology records
literally mean it was present its

303
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:55,100
present in this configuration for the
users to our new bro today is so tight

304
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:01,850
number 64 bro and as the images not that
is trying doctor now pulling down the

305
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:08,360
road now another stern connects to
automatically be installing some prior

306
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,740
to entering an army ready we're still in
his life since this may take a little

307
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:24,389
bit cuz it's actually a pretty big image
media collage I wasn't every time I have

308
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:28,340
another Democrat

309
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:37,980
so awesome for development environments
for this ready if you pull it down and

310
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:45,190
John Shirreffs Lamech Johnson / mayor
and / or sorry yes we built up this

311
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:56,429
particular area and start to have that
running ahead and I think I did this

312
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:59,360
early this morning with you with the
Vienna this is another instance will

313
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:10,370
make its large game here so again I'm a
new user and they now have a few so if

314
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:17,059
if I was marketed this morning I would
guess that was so at this point

315
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:28,320
times also heads down so you picking
image right near burden you click that

316
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,870
number or type in that number your loss
environments are saying student Press

317
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:38,120
number six Murasaki morning bro ham I'm
now environment with Bro

318
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:44,529
spotted dog trainer with the user and
you look

319
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:56,789
been to have the security that the needs
of people to end configuration files and

320
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:00,880
processes ensure that all of the other
configuration which passes the settings

321
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,720
the doctors to do another one so now
let's go to teach them to see them right

322
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,740
now about reducing the number here

323
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:17,179
etcetera so they can quickly go in how
these environments

324
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:23,460
that's all there is to it never go back

325
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,809
see if so now it shows up or down the
doctor to doctor now I'm in true violent

326
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:37,610
with Bro and then we all miss when we
have the same way rose here you can set

327
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,110
this all up so that the patents are
doing the Catholic center that is a very

328
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:47,580
easy way to train so now we're going to
do is we're gonna go back to the slides

329
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:54,260
that was the demo if I want to try this
out right now you can go to democrats

330
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:00,549
out want to dodge on ship dot com and
try to break if you want to do this call

331
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:06,130
you need people to audit so pleased you
an email as you imagine doctor and

332
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:17,039
whatever passwords in parts of the road
now so my free time I had a few months

333
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,770
to work on it when it was due for the
post office has been largely put to the

334
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:26,309
side and uncertainty more development on
it and I plan to do support for other

335
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:29,919
can run time limitations of these
operations of virtualization

336
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,870
technologies such as she also operating
system called to do that also alexei

337
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:42,380
etcetera things that I need from people
or find myself wanting a penetration

338
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,179
test at the Tour career on another
language when I have some free time such

339
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:53,580
as go longer Python does he have a need
to improve the build system some minor

340
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,880
things

341
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,100
training capability when it comes to the
scale this frantically so that you could

342
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,460
have like no other users connected this
node which then put you on the back and

343
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,280
just some other notes that you can like
have a thousand years running the system

344
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:14,810
a thousand so we like how it's capable
person someday in the future also her

345
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:20,929
key contributions if you'd like to help
out with pilot please do it should run

346
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:27,520
it connects to it and then Jimmy patches
are poor and as part of a National

347
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,480

00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,360
whatever you want to play WordPress
instance in 2008 bringing their own

356
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:15,190
WordPress instance from her talk to your
web browser on their client machine the

357
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,030
workstation and talk to that were
present to trigger it you can do that I

358
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,890
have it said was kinda ghetto

359
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,040
iptables trickery and generate support
that's kind of associated with the

360
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,730
parent process idea the process for that
container and no basis to hate bill

361
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:37,869
spill out onto the shell to say hey
tried connecting to http colon server IP

362
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:42,600
sorry and then the port number and their
browser will be in that works for

363
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,230
everyone to communicate any service that
actually needs to access it so it

364
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,859
doesn't have to be just command-line
access to be more production ready bugs

365
00:36:51,859 --> 00:37:06,250
that come talk to me my that that likes
you for priority

366
