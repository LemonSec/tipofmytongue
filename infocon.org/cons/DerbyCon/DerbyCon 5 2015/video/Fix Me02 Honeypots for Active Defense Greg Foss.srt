1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,119
I think we're getting started here a few
minutes early so I got a lot to go over

2
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:35,710
in a short amount of time so so today to
talk about honey pots reactor defense

3
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,190
and so jump right into it

4
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:46,500
first little bit about me boss the head
of security operations along also a

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,940
senior security researcher with the
rides so a lot of fun stuff so that fun

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,370
stuff

7
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:00,390
pots so take a look at traditional
defensive concepts for these are the

8
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,239
things that most people are currently
doing within their organizations right

9
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,060
now to actively protect that right

10
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,530
first and foremost maintain a tough
perimeter and you want to have a hard

11
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,229
outside make it hard for attackers to
get it right and then implement layered

12
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,350
security controls you want it to be
tricky for them to get in get further

13
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,830
give it about stocking of your ideas

14
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,530
wow you know elected stuff in place
right and you want to block all the

15
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,340
stuff you know about the known virus
signatures on the known IDs signatures

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,829
all the stuff the actually attacked the
you actually know you're probably get

17
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,549
hit with rape and then we ought to
reinforce Paul C so that our users

18
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,759
you know we actually protect their user
to keep them from accessing things they

19
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,369
shouldn't stuff like that right and then
we hope that all of this stuff actually

20
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,450
works right we pretend it does but

21
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:55,719
really doesn't matter so they get most
people are here pen tester you can you

22
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,409
know this is there's always a way in

23
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,049
you know it's not likely given working
for a vendor or not gonna come and tell

24
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,399
you like a good buy any security product
and it's going to magically protect your

25
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,390
right there's always going to be this is
Gary here's klingon stuff away into an

26
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,200
organization you have to have you know
not just the right tools that people

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,549
trained and ready to respond to the
stuff people willing and able to

28
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:26,040
actually help defender downward and it's
not just the apt is right it's not just

29
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,739
the attackers from the outside the worry
about because you're inside employees

30
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:35,870
can be bought like people can always be
paid enough to sell your trade secrets

31
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,829
you know people can get fish then all of
a sudden there's someone on your their

32
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:43,569
system their Rd insider environment like
most environments we go into and help

33
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,040
people and we find out you know there's
already someone inside their network

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,620
they've already been breached in some
way that's why this will talk was

35
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,370
created was looking more inward looking
at like what's going on inside your

36
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,280
network and trying to find some way is
to dynamically catch some of these

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:08,389
attackers rate that's why I like active
defense oh yeah so so what is active

38
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:15,799
defense great so it's exactly what it is
right there so what they mean by active

39
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,609
defense is simply no tipping the odds in
your favor making it harder for

40
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:26,480
attackers to penetrate your networks to
do this by creating false systems

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,310
creating false services stuff like that
this can adjust actively dissuade them

42
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,260
from the real targets right and then
trapped them get them caught in your

43
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,739
little fishnets essentially in learn
from them figure out what they're doing

44
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,700
what they're after where they're coming
from where they're going on at all that

45
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,500
good stuff and then that's how we gather
data on and actually learn more about

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,970
who these people are and what they're
after and then using that information we

47
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,519
can better defend them and last phase is
actually attacking back and I don't like

48
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,730
popping shows on attackers and stuff
like that you know you can cross the

49
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,420
line there but within reason their life
things you can do

50
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,680
back to the attackers essentially
essentially all this comes down to

51
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,720
reducing your meantime to detect attacks
and then meantime response you want to

52
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:20,440
minimize that as much as possible and so
here I am Sam Quigley is just the glass

53
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,980
in security engineering is not to make
compromise impossible

54
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,669
the goal is to make it expensive
difficult and noisy that's essentially

55
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,919
what we're doing here so why internal
honey products why why do we want to use

56
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,960
internal honey pots for this one nice
thing with honey pots as there's tons of

57
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,350
them out there and they're really easy
to configure and deploy and maintain

58
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,190
essentially these are just fly traps in
your organization they sit there and

59
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:51,540
wait for weird stuff to hit and the cool
thing about internal honey pots like

60
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,520
external research focused on me pots as
internal ones the most you're looking

61
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,430
for is for someone to raise a flag
essentially you want to trigger an alarm

62
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,229
when they do something so you can
respond and this maybe you know

63
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:06,000
something that if they did this to a
normal system you probably would even

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,350
notice it but since they're interacting
with your honey pots are using only

65
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,120
token or something like that is
something very on and it gives you kind

66
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,460
of a something to follow up on a nice
thing about this is your to learn a ton

67
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,750
about your attackers once you start
deploying internal honey pots and

68
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,850
actively watching what's going on in
these systems the key though with honey

69
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,729
pots kind of something to focus on after
you already have the basics and place

70
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,460
like after you know standard baseline
security control stuff like that that's

71
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,460
when you can start looking to implement
honey pots so what are some use cases

72
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,910
for honey pots primary research this is
how a lot of the Threadless are

73
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,840
generated so how a lot of the companies
out there are generating data to help

74
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,970
better generate rules and stuff like
that for their products and things like

75
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,240
that but defense is primarily were gonna
focus today that's that's using honey

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,240
pots in a way that not a lot of
companies are doing right now so defense

77
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,780
so tell about that there's actually
quite a few virtual machines out there

78
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,000
you can deploy for free within your
environment to mess with tony Potts and

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,210
start figuring this stuff out the first
ones honey drive three buddhist pretty

80
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,550
cool project I would recommend this for
like an actual enterprise defensive

81
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,099
deployment though because this isn't the
system's not very well guarded at all

82
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:30,330
it's more open and like a test bed for
playing with various honey pots so you

83
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,650
can go in there and figure out like what
honey pots you want to use on other

84
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,800
systems in a real way on this one you
know someone start poking out it's a

85
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,300
dead giveaway right away that it's a
honeypot says hi everywhere like the web

86
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,849
interfaces and stuff like that have to
be careful but it is something good to

87
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:53,590
learn from now I do like using an actual
defensive scenarios is ADHD the active

88
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,289
defense harbinger distribution and this
is my black girls information security

89
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:00,720
insecure ideas all those companies are
here and like a lot of the people that

90
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,000
actually helped create this are actually
at the conference right now so if you

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,690
find them you should definitely ask him
about ADHD because it's a very powerful

92
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:13,430
tool and it's actually you know honey
pots but also has acted defense Tulsi

93
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,289
can attack back at the attackers well so
very cool project highly recommend you

94
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:23,280
check it out but first things first
before you start deploying any of the

95
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,139
stuff we start tracking attackers and
watching what they're doing and you know

96
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,919
launching client-side code on their
systems and stuff like that you want to

97
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,780
deploy warning banners for all the
systems in your environment this gives

98
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,759
Ely way so that when people who are
logging into these systems you know

99
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,479
legitimate or illegitimate leader having
to go through warning banner that

100
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,990
essentially says hey you agree to these
terms because whether you like it or not

101
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,419
attackers actually have rights even
though they're inside your company so if

102
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,560
you like poppers show on now but you
didn't like having to go through an

103
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,430
approval this is like you can do
something like that you can actually get

104
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,690
in a little bit of trouble for that so
it's just something to keep in mind so

105
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,259
what are some types of high Potts you
know this is kind of my breakdown of

106
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:10,190
honey pots there's a lot of different
varied viewpoints on honey pots out

107
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,690
there says my and my interpretations so
no interaction these are essentially

108
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,090
honey ports just basic services the city

109
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,669
up there and either log or block based
on interactions with with those ports

110
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:30,139
and then lo interaction is it a very
basic basic flat web page or something

111
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,229
like that you know not a whole lot going
on there

112
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,200
medium interaction are kind of the most
popular honey pot season was actually

113
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,820
simulate real services you know I guess
the Sager sepia tone out something like

114
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,010
that and then hire action these are more
like actual real systems or systems that

115
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,260
are set up to imitate real system so
essentially trying to imitate every

116
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,180
aspect of the operating system and then
my favorite ones are honey tokens and

117
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,750
honey drives and strings and stuff like
that these are the ones that you can

118
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,020
actually get a ton of traction for our
and also you in a little bit we're so no

119
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:14,670
interaction honey pots first so these
are essentially just funny ports these

120
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,400
are very easy to build and deploy its
been like this

121
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,510
Linux example here this is actually from
the ADHD CD is also in the hands of

122
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,640
countermeasures are about to defense
book so I highly recommend that book as

123
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,589
well

124
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,650
parade here you know just a couple lines
of bad effectively created honey port

125
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,000
and what this does

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,610
all right here in assimilating FTP and
that whenever someone next to this it

127
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,100
just blocks them from the host to
seizing local iptables

128
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,140
very simple you can also do the same
thing on Windows I just using that

129
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,660
candidacy which I just a few lines of
code as well so really easy to build out

130
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,830
and then you can simply push these out
to other systems with a new environment

131
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,070
but then when you really want to get
into some more you know little bit more

132
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,680
in-depth reports there's actually Python
in PowerShell tools as well to do this

133
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,920
so our show there's still called Windows
PowerShell honey ports this is actually

134
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,650
on ADHD as well

135
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:19,050
scripts script by by Jon Voight and
carlos perez essentially what this does

136
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,820
is it's just the same as the neck at
estate auction was PowerShell so you

137
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,550
know a lot easier to deploy you can
actually deploy this remotely on systems

138
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,379
be like W my stuff like that really
easily

139
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:35,239
so same sort of calm separate here we're
just simulating 421 and then we're going

140
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:38,549
to connect to rate we're going to
connect using netcat over to this host

141
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:42,709
answer first connection succeeded as
expected right and then right after that

142
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,709
were blocked so simple as that right

143
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,029
mostly long as all the activity that
happens seek an injustice and do

144
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:54,629
whatever log management system using
sorry here you'll generate you start to

145
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:58,339
generate a list of these hoes and you
can choose to not like him too and just

146
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:02,079
start generating a list and you can use
this list later on to correlate back in

147
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,809
time to see like what else these people
have been up to acquire they poking

148
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:11,559
around at the systems stuff like that
and Linux there's an awesome tool called

149
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:22,049
artillery by someone you might know Mr
Dave Kennedy so they can run on Linux

150
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:26,470
actually has a Windows binaries well
with the really nice thing with with

151
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,079
artillery it does kind of the same sort
of thing it just you know logs and

152
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,409
blocks based on people connecting to a
report you decide to imitate

153
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:37,549
but also shoots back a bunch of junk
here which is kind of funny because

154
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:41,419
sometimes I see people trying like
actually figure out what this is so you

155
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:46,309
can waste their time we'll have a really
nice thing with artillery is there's

156
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:51,859
lots of really great way is to pull logs
from this so by default it just on the

157
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:55,919
logs into the Linux syslog so you're
probably already pulling these logs you

158
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,389
can just add additional searches for
artillery and then he can you know

159
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:04,600
essentially is set up alarms and stuff
like that off of that activity so in

160
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,720
addition to local syslog you can also
just create its own flat files you can

161
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,919
have Justin artillery flat file logged
essentially doubled his lungs into or

162
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,809
you can push to a remote syslog server a
lot of ways to pull this data and push

163
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,789
everything off to another host rape and
same sort of thing

164
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:26,679
IP's are added to ban list and block
locally now a bonus feature with an

165
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,079
artillery is actually does a full system
security check once you once you run

166
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,720
this social life running your web
server's root or something like that

167
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,499
I'll tell you it'll give you a bunch of
key indicators like haters you don't

168
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:40,790
have your system configured

169
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,770
so that's a nice features were all but
one of my favorite parts that comes with

170
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:50,540
free built-in file integrity monitoring
here we're just simulating basically

171
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,250
creating a web show was uploaded our
little shell . php files is what all

172
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:02,670
attackers do you know that we have the
final there and we can tell within the

173
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,460
artillery logs that this new file is
generated and the final census alert

174
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,930
this file is added so you know just a
nice additional feature on top of the

175
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:18,860
honey port activity itself saying here
run public facing honey pots yeah this

176
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,910
is probably not be anything new to you
guys right here I just like showing

177
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,700
people how to really run honey pots just
like how often your systems are hit when

178
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,690
they're just directly open on the
internet this is like some random ec2

179
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,160
instance here and has just blown up this
is just less than a day of running just

180
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,560
a honey port on this post so it's like
people to see that so they get the point

181
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,100
across of like don't put RTP open the
internet or like don't put SSH over the

182
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,580
internet without SSH keys and stuff like
that you're getting hit all the time so

183
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,360
it's kind of like reinforcing that point
move on to new interaction on any pots

184
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,740
so actually getting in like sum the web
applications and stuff like that is a

185
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,270
pretty hot

186
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,830
this one is very old so so fair warning
if you're going to deploy this you do

187
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,810
want to customize a bit like if you just
spend this up and throw it out there

188
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,810
people are gonna look at the readme page
and it's gonna say like oh this is one

189
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,350
from like this is a wordpress site from
the nineties so it would be a little

190
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,330
careful there but it's a just a little
small python script you can deploy very

191
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,500
easily and it logs to flat files so very
easy to ingest into whatever whatever

192
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,010
you're logging solution as well

193
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,250
PHP my admin know they're good service
to fake just because like how often do

194
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,570
you check your logs and see PHP my admin
sweeps against your environment so if

195
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,980
you're running like a fake PHP my admin
interface the you let them gain access

196
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,850
to it doesn't actually have a back-end
database you can actually gather a lot

197
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,120
of data from them just by you know like
full packet capture on this hostess

198
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,720
well so you gonna see everything that
they're they're hitting your house with

199
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,850
sometimes you can actually get the full
exploits as well as carve out of the

200
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,320
pcap this is a great way to do that and
this you know same sort of thing

201
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,980
blogs to a flat file and it's very easy
to deploy on existing applications by

202
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,440
admin something that is very popular lot
of people use it cuz they don't really

203
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,630
know how to admin their back-end
databases that well so it's a very

204
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:27,580
popular air and popularly misconfigured
there now you can do this with any fake

205
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,830
application you can basically gotten
clone whatever you want and weaponize it

206
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,040
and turn it into a fake application
sorry here we're doing is we're

207
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:44,440
simulating a fake VPN service day when I
take a guess why we're simulating bpm

208
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,800
well first and foremost you want to
learn what user names attacker has to

209
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,200
say like if they have really user names
passwords that but the real reason they

210
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,570
decided to simulate a VPN so we could
run client-side code on them this is

211
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:09,890
here so we can run Java on their on
their points like once they're accessing

212
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,040
this thing you can do like reverse
fishing to trick them into logging into

213
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,670
this thing or whatever like see if
they're on a certain host once you get

214
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:23,950
them to run client-side code you can do
stuff like this so honey badger badger I

215
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,040
think Tim Tim tones he's the developer
of that i think is actually here

216
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:35,670
actually does it uses your wireless card
to scan for all the other wireless

217
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,459
networks around you and then it uses the
Google Location API to essentially

218
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:44,680
pinpoint your location it's very
accurate actually is so so here's an

219
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,390
example of how this works because
attackers were never gonna attack

220
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:52,190
directly from their own systems justice
a bad idea rate so here we're going

221
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,980
through Switzerland some proxy in
Switzerland but then we open this

222
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,570
document that we bond and we do use
honey badger to gather some additional

223
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:05,140
data on and actually shows were in
Westminster so pretty cool it's funny

224
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,270
how accurate the thing is I was playing
with them how

225
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,690
house and actually pinpoint my location
exactly in my office where I was sitting

226
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:18,040
so many crazy media interaction

227
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,110
up the chain here so there's tons of
these this is by far the most popular

228
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,339
type of honey pot so I'm just gonna
focus on line because it's my favorite

229
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,230
one and one that I've gotten a lot of
really good traction from netscape oh

230
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:39,510
and so is very simple just simulates a
sage so basically fake a Linux host or

231
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:46,130
network just little Python scripts that
you can heavily customized to acquire

232
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,170
all of the other Linux hosts with Inter
Milan which exactly like whatever you

233
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,580
want it to look like and you can further
customize the command output and all

234
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:01,030
sorts of other stuff so little tool to
push out to multiple devices within your

235
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,890
within your environment on the really
cool part about this keeps Standard Flat

236
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:11,280
File logs but also stars the full ttyl
session now it's nice about that is you

237
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,700
can replay when the attacker did and
what they saw and everything like that

238
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,120
in real time so you can see like all the
commands they ran you can see the output

239
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,260
that they receive Cece like the whole
picture it also helps differentiate

240
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,290
between like a bot and real person as
you can tell by the speed they're doing

241
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:34,590
things they have typos stuff like that
the problem with this is a very popular

242
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,160
honey pot so this is one that's been out
for years now and a lot of people have

243
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,680
used this researchers of studies up all
over the internet so attackers now know

244
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,340
about this and there's a lot of easy
ways to quickly check that their they've

245
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,210
logged into a honey pot and terminate
their session so you just have to be

246
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,430
careful that like this isn't what I
would deploy facing the internet this is

247
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,980
more when I would stand up inside and
just see if someone actually was into it

248
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,590
another risk with exposing these
externally is that if someone actually

249
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:09,060
connects this thing a lot of bots
earlier about networks while she just

250
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,100
log into these clinics house and noticed
stay logged in

251
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,550
they do and this can incur a lot of
additional cost free if you're like

252
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,310
Amazon or something like that

253
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:22,490
have to be cautious of that and also go
and I'll try and attack other systems

254
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,810
from this box it won't work because
there is no honey pot but you can still

255
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:33,100
incur additional charges you can also
use could pose a pen test tool sort of

256
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,250
fun thing to do is keep up whatever
doing like an internal pen test just

257
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,370
like your shared server that you guys
are all logging into and stuff like that

258
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,630
movie legitimate service and then just
dan kept her up and just wait let it sit

259
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,900
there for like a day or two and
guaranteed something's gonna lie in that

260
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,910
box whether it's like a vulnerability
scanner or configuration management

261
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,730
system or something like that

262
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,540
jets or something along again and then
you can steal the credentials really

263
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:12,330
easily so here's an example of capo if
if no one's really played with it so we

264
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,750
did here is a desayunar iptables script
which essentially all this does is it

265
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,630
forwards any requests destined for port
22 to port 2222 which is where actually

266
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:27,010
spending up the honeypot so now we're
gonna change perimeter good changed her

267
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:57,440
kibble user man well this is a good time
I'm just glad this demo play is awful

268
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:11,730
there's a Smirnoff Ice I think there's
more if you like one so what happened

269
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,360
back here as are using the honey pot and
essentially tried some some bad

270
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,129
passwords and stuff like that and that's
essentially what I was showing in the

271
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:24,580
back in here is the logs now this is the
reason not a lot of people actually run

272
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,480
honey pots and because they don't want
to go through this massive amount of

273
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,940
data that's what if your gonna do this
you should pull him into some sort of

274
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,610
like management system so that you can
go through and actually make use of this

275
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:40,350
data rate down here with the attackers
done as they just essentially got on the

276
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,990
host did some you know basically
figuring out where they are some

277
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,250
operational kinda you know intelligence
on the host they've gained access to and

278
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,779
then they pulled down a file the cool
thing with hippo is that once they

279
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:56,870
pulled down any power to the house
actually does story in this DL directory

280
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,330
so you can go grab it later a shit
compared it stuff like that sort of

281
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:07,769
showing here is an alert that was
generated based on the hippo honeypot

282
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,149
being breached

283
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:13,330
so whenever they reach you want to know
about it and so what I did here as I

284
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:18,990
just replayed the ttyl session and sent
over as an attachment to the email

285
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,720
funny part when I did this damage this
is actually a real attacker like hitting

286
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,840
her honeypot slightly open their online
this is ours this is the one we actually

287
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:35,970
just generated says unexpected so I
didn't have it formatted rate at the

288
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,279
time either but since we pay seen here
we can see like this is everything the

289
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,269
attacker did and saw you know presented
to us neatly and in the form of alert

290
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:49,900
essentially now

291
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,320
if you want to check this out of cloned
the capo repo so if you wanna check out

292
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,740
my guess I have a bunch of other scripts
to you that I've done like for their

293
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,790
argument the capo client like added some
monitoring scripts and stuff like that

294
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,660
as well so if you wanna check this out

295
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:11,800
there's my my get up there and higher
action on any pots high interaction

296
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,400
honey pots are essentially real systems
and the way we deploy amount longer them

297
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,650
is in the sense of their real systems
put real systems on the internet but we

298
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,280
have dedicated monitoring of highly
instrumental these systems so he can see

299
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,590
for command-line access we can see
everything that's happening on the hosts

300
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:35,290
essentially so some just a few of the
tools that we used to do this for free

301
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:42,330
tools are these aren't so much free but
but so in addition to whatever logging

302
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,210
system you have is good to always be
watching this data but Sir Cana is a

303
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,900
really cool idea solution and not just
for you know the traditional idea sense

304
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,020
we actually is circled for his Wii
sinkhole the traffic so whenever the

305
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,050
members trying to call out with sinkhole
it and we send it says her kata kata

306
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,780
allows us to actually interact with them
our actually it creates a really cool

307
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:09,000
ability to interact with some with some
of the weird malware out there is the

308
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,280
one we do use more in line like as an
actual ideas where we actually try and

309
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,130
block some of the traffic and try and
see what she was going on right and then

310
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,540
congress and boxes and see where we
lower our exploded and gather some of

311
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:31,410
that that analysis room right now this
is a fun project Roman hunter this is

312
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:37,130
the router Manhunter so you don't have
to just use real real systems to create

313
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,220
any pots this one's essentially turning
your router into a honeypot so this is

314
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,370
you set up a real access prime and all
it does waits for someone to connect to

315
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,680
it successfully so the fun thing here is
it considered either as security and

316
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,310
security want and depending on how you
want to gauge the attackers that are are

317
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,000
breaching it like you said it with
weapons someone pops it you know

318
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,470
probably whatever but he said like it w
it

319
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,119
wpa2 or something

320
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,869
and someone gets and that's something
like you might want to look into what

321
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:10,199
this does it takes their MAC address and
just adds it to list and see can take

322
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:13,689
this Mac and you can correlate this back
against your real environment see like

323
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:18,509
an employee or is not an employee r you
know what is this

324
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:23,669
that's like one of the it's just a fun
little honey possibly can deploy on on

325
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:28,909
the router now we did lots warnings with
high interaction honey pots because

326
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:33,689
you're essentially using real systems is
dangerous to have dedicated to honoring

327
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:38,229
someone watching this all the time
because there's a huge risk if you don't

328
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:41,409
have someone watching this ready to
respond already take the system offline

329
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:45,419
if they start attacking other hosts are
things like that cuz I could come back

330
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,769
to your company you also don't want to
please even in your own IP space if you

331
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:55,939
are you know trying to do stuff like
that on the internet right to never use

332
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:59,679
your goal your organization's gold
standard image when you're deploying a

333
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:06,769
higher action on a pot of a story about
this there's company who decided to

334
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:11,039
deploy some honey pots and what they did
was actually put out real systems out in

335
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,469
a DMZ that was under their control and
of course in RTP open to the internet

336
00:26:15,469 --> 00:26:20,309
with a weak password as I think it was
the day they put it up it got buried and

337
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:24,219
so what happened is they've gotten to
this hostname dump the local admin ashes

338
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:28,189
and like the company has disabled so
they'd like we're not ready for honey

339
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:33,139
pots and and they actually use that to
pivot into the organization so like

340
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:37,259
deploying a honeypot cause illegitimate
breach for this company so we have to be

341
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:42,229
very careful and like you know make sure
you really take precautions if your

342
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:47,119
gonna try some of this stuff and part of
this is segment doing so and proper

343
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:55,320
segmenting so put something out

344
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:03,910
folks and unfortunately throws up again
and we have no audio and video to speak

345
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:16,740
of moving until about the 32nd minute
mark so you voted there but we do have a

346
00:27:16,740 --> 00:34:50,520
slide in the meantime

347
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:58,490
you can see there on a windows box
labeled as a tablet PC right there is an

348
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:03,300
office to get some good data on this
just right from here now of course

349
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:11,670
there's been IP address go course right
why would it go anywhere else right well

350
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:17,990
there is some more to the story but
that's actually the wire transfer he did

351
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,440
send this to a banking and EUS in
california is actually reached out to

352
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,570
this bank we let them know I K look for
this coming through the wire transfer

353
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,670
like a like you know this person and
stuff like that and actually from the

354
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:36,110
job we can tell a lot more of this
person who turns out of the whole

355
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:41,660
Nigeria LinkedIn is not really was all a
ruse which is pretty genius when you

356
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,640
think about it they're using that to say
like Nigerians gathered in a stop right

357
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:52,570
there pretty it pretty genius if I say
so myself so what are some more things

358
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,840
you can do to just screw with people
rights groups attackers and stuff like

359
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,810
that

360
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:01,830
my favorites is just the bonds are so
funny can plant the is like somewhere

361
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:07,090
people might be trying to steal stuff or
whatever the thing with this is a bomb

362
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:12,380
unforgettable that DK is this file
called 42 does it it's like it's like a

363
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:18,860
four point to like byte file that once
they expanding its like it's like 30

364
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,060
different zips compressed in another zip
like it's it's ridiculous

365
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,830
expands to like four point to petabytes

366
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:33,690
deploy this is still take out of
supercomputer basically

367
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:40,000
beef beef is another fun one so if
you're overdoing it like testers he

368
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,860
probably is be four you know exercised
validation stuff like that but like when

369
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:49,370
you own the environment in your own like
where these attackers are are in

370
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:53,140
essentially you can just inject your own
be folks from do like dynamic wrinkles

371
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,630
on and stuff like that or like pop shows
are you know whenever you really want to

372
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:03,350
do is an awesome if you had a chance to
play with it and you have to be another

373
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:07,800
fun one actually haven't built one of
these cuz I'm afraid to have someone

374
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,140
like Fri my computer that's what it does
it's essentially you take the USPS

375
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,540
actually turns into basically a battery
like all the details are here definitely

376
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,560
check it out if you wanna mess with this
thing but it's like it be the equivalent

377
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,820
of you like plug-in USB directly into
the wall and Mike into your computer and

378
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:38,630
then click he is always fun this
actually I'm yes he is the past and the

379
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:43,390
cool things you can do this with any
images really it's just a PHP IDs

380
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:50,500
features actually but I can dynamically
screw with people and people office

381
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:56,200
mostly funny I think it one of my
favorites this is like the dumbest thing

382
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,190
ever but it's so funny just cat
different him overnight cats have never

383
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:08,440
seen this is what it looks like people
in there for a long time trying to

384
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:17,319
figure out what this is

385
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:27,499
so that there's no sit there like what
is this we needed decipher this you know

386
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:32,299
it's funny just waste their time for a
long time now to take it to the next

387
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:39,249
level you can do full on ASCII art like
this is fine I'd definitely check out

388
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:44,109
the script down here with them see what
this does lousy to play for movies

389
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:52,739
through like telnet sessions and stuff
like that and then we get record in

390
00:38:52,739 --> 00:39:04,019
asking so let's get back to you know
kind of the meat of everything we're

391
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:08,529
talking about the key to all of this can
we bring everything back together is

392
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:13,690
actually monitoring the stuff so bring
into some central management interface

393
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,219
you can actually watch what's happening
and dynamically respond to what's going

394
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:24,019
on you're within your honey pots and
your real network so you want to bring

395
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:27,479
in all your security tools you want to
have like at least a single pane glass

396
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:32,079
Regency kinda everything that's going on
you might be able to monitor your honey

397
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,650
pots and you want to be able to
dynamically correlate that back with the

398
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,109
real environments like they've been
doing this over here in the honey pots

399
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:43,249
was a Caesar been doing against real
systems for like the past 30 days and

400
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:47,289
that's just the stuff you wanna try and
tie the pieces together using honey pots

401
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:51,130
kind of as well as the glue in between
all this and once you have a very good

402
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,499
network of kind of all the stuff setup
you can actually start to create your

403
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:59,910
own essentially enterprise threat
intelligence and sore throat until like

404
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,640
totally just way over use and stuff like
that but but when talking about here is

405
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,140
context aware credit else this is like
stuff this directly affecting you and

406
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,519
your unique industry has like it here
and retailer of different stuff and say

407
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,380
hospitals hospitals can be hit by
different stuff and say the government

408
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,900
to like you know getting these giant
threat list of IP is i mean that doesn't

409
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,579
do a whole lot of good but if you
generate your own like IOC's based off

410
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:27,020
of what you're actually seeing in your
environment

411
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,380
and then you share with them similar
industries you can actually gained a lot

412
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:45,130
of traction on the dog comes down to
shun very now the next aspect is you

413
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,490
actually want to automate your response
to these threats so one of my favorite

414
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:53,510
ways of doing this is actually just
dynamic honey products like taking a

415
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,710
system that's probably compromised or
are you suspect something weird going on

416
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,180
and dynamically turn that into a
honeypot there's a couple ways to do

417
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:07,750
this very easily just by implementing
command my logging to detailed their

418
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:12,420
sentry gun registry value up to set for
the command prompt and you can create a

419
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:19,800
profile that ps1 file to get power show
now there's a really good down here so

420
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,490
Michael girl he actually presented
earlier today are yes some awesome

421
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:27,340
information on Lake detailed verbose
command-line auditing so I highly

422
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:33,040
recommend checking that out if you want
to implement some of the stuff you know

423
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,590
there's also a lot of tools out there
that will help you with automating

424
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:42,100
response so first time Google rapid
response pretty pretty neat tool makes

425
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:48,770
it very easy to respond to threats and
work as a team to share intelligence you

426
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:53,760
gather already netflix has their own
project phyto Khan says a really cool

427
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,630
PowerShell framework for a response and
empower forensics is an awesome project

428
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,070
actually everything at invoke I R is
actually really cool air attack in Sinai

429
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,930
think of his name

430
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:11,000
really sharp guy behind like the whole
invoke I R project so I highly recommend

431
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,400
checking this out but so I wanted to
jump into the mix too with the whole

432
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,250
breast cancer response can think to say
I wrote this little tool called up

433
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:26,050
yesterday and just short for power show
recon essentially what this is

434
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:32,720
script that we've we've integrated with
with our Sam essentially to go out like

435
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,240
say we see something weird like a like a
crypto were outbreak on a network we

436
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,869
want to do is go pull friends of data
from this home

437
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:43,549
and then knocked offline really quick so
doesn't know spread to share something

438
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:44,589
like that

439
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:49,880
century the goal of up yes recon you can
also run as a standalone script and I

440
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,230
think it does pretty well you guys
should check it out and let me now where

441
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:59,349
you like and don't like about it but one
of the aspects we added into the tool is

442
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:03,109
that when it does go pull data from the
host you can set up to send out email

443
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:07,970
reports to you know the entire scared
operations team to let them know i ka

444
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,980
like this hostage-taking offline here's
a bunch of forensics data from that

445
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,329
hosts we just pulled and so just sent
out this email and read here actually

446
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:22,240
gives you a report of all the data on
the host nice thing about the the report

447
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,059
is everything self-contained has images
base 64 encoded directly into the page

448
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:31,130
and stuff like that so you don't have to
reach out to another server too poor to

449
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,279
pull anything down so makes it makes a
nice for you know quick and simple

450
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:41,869
answer response essentially so how do
you bring together and everything we

451
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,940
kinda we kinda just talked about

452
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:50,130
well one of the main things is honey pot
dashboards so actually being able to

453
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:56,849
track everything is going on in your
honey pots in one easy to use way dr 3

454
00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:00,259
nice things about it has a ton of
different dashboards in there basically

455
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:04,029
just about every honey pot that it has
installed it has a corresponding

456
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:08,650
dashboard on something you can go check
out and like figure out what dashboards

457
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,900
want to use if you're if you're going
like full open source you want to do

458
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,690
something with a commercial solution
it's a good resource to start with so

459
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:21,119
you can figure out why honey pots
forward for your your situations and

460
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,489
then keep a graph is one of these
sources we talked about keeping I

461
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:28,859
definitely want to mention kipah graph
is this basically pulls all of the data

462
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:33,739
they were talking about out and shows an
easy-to-understand way so we're looking

463
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,559
at the wall of text earlier

464
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:38,799
well this actually helps make some sense
of that

465
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:41,799
of modern highly networked this one we
didn't really have time to talk about

466
00:44:41,799 --> 00:44:46,179
details but this is a really cool
project in that you can dynamically

467
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:50,589
deploy honey pots and monitor them from
one interface as long as you have extra

468
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:54,549
IP space you can just keep pushing out
more honey pots and he's actually use

469
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:58,170
some of the more advanced forms like
Diana glass top and some of the like the

470
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,289
really high interaction honey pots so
pretty cool project that you should

471
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:09,299
definitely check it out and then of
course you know the best 148 no I'm like

472
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:17,099
that ok well just jump right into the
data should be collecting them so so

473
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:22,699
down a lot of the most important data
that like to collect in the dashboards

474
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:27,660
that I use top attacking IP address
wanna see who's hitting these honey pots

475
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,660
and then the trending want to look at
the trending of honeypot attacks verse

476
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,589
the trending the entire environments
wanna correlate the two and see like

477
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:42,269
where the spikes happen and if they if
they really talk usernames find out if

478
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:47,660
people have really isn't that they're
using fake ones suffer top passwords

479
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,099
they think it looks like real passers
you want to figure out your dive into

480
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:54,099
that and see like those as someone who
actually had their credential store

481
00:45:54,099 --> 00:46:00,599
stuff like that and then honey took in
file access so this is finals but

482
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,029
tracking honey token access is something
you definitely want to have great

483
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:08,900
friends centers so say someone's door
document moved it you know they did

484
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,410
something else with it you want to know
about that and so having that the

485
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:17,199
dashboards a good way to do that and
then user agent strings so user agent

486
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:21,349
strings are kind of the one of the more
undervalued aspects that they were

487
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:26,109
looking out here to talk about the
attackers because most people don't

488
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:29,589
bother to change the user agent strings
when they're attacking websites and

489
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:33,390
stuff like that so you can learn you
know if they're using tools to scan you

490
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,910
are there you know if they're just using
their browser they're using like a

491
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:40,779
foreign browser something like that like
it will give you a lot of intel on just

492
00:46:40,779 --> 00:46:45,670
what what's hitting your environment and
then payloads any malware that's cool

493
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:50,009
down to the hosts want to track and
directionality

494
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:52,230
to figure out where they're coming from
where they're going

495
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:57,280
going all that good stuff then so from
there you end up with a you know decent

496
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,550
dashboard covering here honey pots honey
pots and your real environments

497
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:11,420
essentially so that is when I jump into
some work cited recommended reading so

498
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,820
most of what I what I talked about it is
actually based off of some of the work

499
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,770
that John strand and Paul a story and
have done so I highly recommend their

500
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:24,070
book offensive countermeasures the art
of active defense it's a great read and

501
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:27,810
it's like it's a very short book but
like every page is actually has really

502
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:32,040
good content on it so highly recommend
that book and if you're ever gonna do I

503
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,119
R

504
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,220
the blue team handbook is is a great
resource is very short and simple as

505
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,910
precise to like here's what you need to
know for like performing this sort of

506
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:47,700
engagement or something like that so
very kind of straight to the point now

507
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,280
if you wanna get really deep into our
game and like management check out

508
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:59,760
logging in log management by Anton
shrunken and Kevin Smith you know the

509
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,410
logging it could be hard to get through
but it's it's a good read

510
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:07,580
actually has some really good stuff like
build out of stock in the right way and

511
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:13,820
stuff like that and then this last one
reverse deception cyberthreat counter

512
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:18,310
exploitation it's exactly like the name
sounds it's a counter Intel book and it

513
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:22,400
talks about how the deist deceive
attackers and some of the tricks that

514
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,560
like CI folks used to deceive and trick
people into divulging information and

515
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,359
all sorts of other good stuff so so if
you wanna do any of this stuff anymore

516
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:46,860
check out some of these resources for
that thanks

517
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:52,070
around
