7
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:54,980
the Internet of Things Are help those
words have helped kill an industry

8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,770
social background i mean that is my
normal Twitter profile picture I have

9
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,070
actually changed it right now so people
can recognize me when I'm in public as I

10

mentioned the other day they don't know
where that out in public anymore I like

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,310
it was like Star Wars dork what can I
say I run an event here since the first

12
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:23,020
Derby Conn called bourbon con like
bourbon I just moved out of the DEC

13
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,330
metro area but I still think you know I
still find kindred spirits than over

14
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,030
hackers and all the people I've met
there I put my employer on here because

15
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,140
for once actually not ashamed of my
employer and I'm not just saying that

16
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,850
because my boss walked in the room so
I'm gonna do quick shameless plugging

17
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,040
for bourbon con it is tonight it is

front of hotel make a right and walk

20
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,960
until you get to the river if you want
to pin the river you've gone too far

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,060
we do bourbon tasting every year it is
20 bucks cash at the door if for some

22
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,179
reason you don't carry cash with you

or until 8 p.m. tonight we do still have
some presale tickets available on

24
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,709
November 8 look at the apartment on
Twitter profile the link is on there we

25
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,920
have great sponsors this year like we do
every year you know he said cincinnati

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,050
has been scrutinized to your sponsor
since we've been able to get away

27
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:37,470
class where we do have a limited number
so reso's people get priority and you

28
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,820
know it's it's a quiet atmosphere at
social com you don't have to say though

29
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,239
three hours you can come to terms even
fifteen minutes if you are so all the

30
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,330
money that we raise from that event
beyond our costs Cody tipsy lecture is

31
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,519
over $2000 for them so hoping we can
hopefully get to that this year not

32
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,370
looking too good right now so a lot of
people to show up to me now get to my

33
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,269
disclaimers I had to do this one a few
years ago which is that all views and

34
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,630
opinions contained within this
presentation are my own and do not

35
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,690
reflect the beliefs or opinions of my
employer any other affiliated

36
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:21,000
organizations hasn't asked for that but
I'm just preempting them over to a

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,190
specific for this talk if you play but
we're drinking games the stock may be

38
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,260
dangerous to your health

39
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,110
there will be several such words used
throughout the presentation however

40
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,190
their usage Santana for academic use
only and is not recommended that you use

41
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,690
these words in your normal daily as such
actually did have a couple of other

42
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:44,109
titles are going to use like drinking
games are fun

43
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:50,750
organizers and sponsors because there
may be some subtle and some also not so

44
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:57,239
subtle jabbing that certain companies
during this presentation I won't name

45
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,680
names of promise and then went all
titles went on to become the movie

46
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,570
titles because it seems like every time
I do talk presentation I get title it

47
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,020
always has a subtitle to it for some
reason

48
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:16,720
so some of my research I did a lot of
fun to validate were some of these buzz

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,770
words came from around what we've been
doing what I found two really good

50
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,430
sources for this are looking at patterns
caused by the time it starts appearing

51
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,190
in patton's it's already been used for
last like 45 years the other one is

52
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,360
reported PTO because everything's there
but it says their trust but verify

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,260
you know a lot of this little buggy
things when you're doing you're looking

54
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,730
up words and try to find out it's
histories it's it's very sketchy and

55
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,750
it's surprising we can do it at all
considering I'm looking at words are

56
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:03,900
largely from the last 50 years and it's
impossible to figure out how weird finds

57
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,040
itself in the dictionary definition I
found you know it's it's what we all

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,170
think it is right it it's really just
code for jargon but you know it some

59
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:21,010
thought it was more fun and like I said
was over his origins are somewhat murky

60
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,290
the one that gets repeated a lot of the
internet is that you know 1940's

61
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,330
business students at Harvard who have
nothing better to do decided to start

62
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,870
firing to certain words as buzzwords in
their business classes seen other sites

63
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,380
without much reference that point to the
sixties and seventies it's it's one of

64
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,180
those things where you can dig into
indigent trying to find out when

65
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:48,200
somebody first used it actually tried to
use even some really all sites that you

66
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,070
like archived newspapers and stuff like
that to see if I could find like pre

67
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:59,000
nineteen hundreds references to the
words but I cannot go for someone who

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,320
doesn't weird but it was not in the
right context and I wasn't even quite

69
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,810
sure what they were using it for here's
my definition of a buzzword really it's

70
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,130
it's in the freezer used by corporations
marketers and salesmen that are intended

71
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,169
to sound important designed to confuse

72
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:20,919
the users and master room 10 Russell
product right some companies will sit

73
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:29,800
out there and scream we use a sandbox
and secure games so it's one of those

74
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,069
things where you know it is a buzzword a
buzzword you know I don't know what

75
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:41,669
anyone would think but the moment I do
believe it is so I decided to start with

76
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:49,009
everyone's favorite cyber and I'm going
to be saying cyber alot right now so you

77
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:55,419
can call cringe but his drawers with say
one more time mother fucker I dare you

78
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:06,699
so what are the origins from cybernetics
and at some point somebody decided to

79
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,789
cyber off of it and start using it for a
bunch of words I found this one from New

80
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:14,360
York magazine this quote very very
hilarious which was which is from

81
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,449
ninety-six think cyber became ridiculous
and it was a perfect prefix because

82
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,399
nobody has any idea what it can be
grafted onto any old word to make it

83
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:30,360
seem new cool and therefore strange in
school and I think that's very true I

84
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,710
think a lot of issues we deal with and
computer security information security

85
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,029
network security whatever you want to
call it as a rebellious appointed as

86
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:43,699
cybersecurity I think a lot of those
same terms we get to make it sound

87
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,580
speaker and particularly to that a lot
of the decision-makers at work of these

88
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,050
companies who don't know better just
fuels that you know fear of anything new

89
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:59,089
from entering some of the origins you
know it dates back to cybernetics being

90
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:04,629
used back in the sixties Control Data
Corporation started selling cyber

91
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:09,289
mainframes the brand of the machines are
so I'm afghan patterns that reference

92
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:15,629
different words for cyber dating back to
the seventies some some people claim

93
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,490
William Gibson for using cyberspace and
then I pray everything but I think an

94
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,389
honesty the timepoint sum orkut decided
he doesn't really scurrilous you cyber

95
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:25,600
for

96
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:33,700
and as you can see we put cyber on
anything you know it's there's there

97
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,620
there's as I like to say there are more
forms of cyber the mirror so it really

98
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,100
is one of those situations where they
come up with new words you know what's

99
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,960
different about cybersecurity from all
the other words that were using right

100
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,780
this if it were for the network security
computer security system security they

101
00:08:52,780 --> 00:09:00,870
tried to refuse cyber as a blanket term
you know it's it's it's new abstract

102
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,840
thing and so they like to use this as a
turn to scare people it really is what

103
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:16,430
about apt and install packages and ever
so the Chinese in my box I'm sure

104
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:22,270
everyone's made that joke I'm sorry so
its advanced persistent threat pretty

105
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,680
much every source file fine gates's fact
the USAir force circle about 2006 so

106
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,490
thank you

107
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,010
anachronism yes you can blame the US
government that sounds about right as in

108
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,230
Pakistan's in about 2007 2008 so again
that matches up with the 2006 timeline

109
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,940
but the reality is you know this is
probably my own belief from what I was

110
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,460
seeing is that until the apt one came
out nobody new apt was and then some

111
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:59,190
company made a shit ton of money going
AVT AVT AVT AVT screaming and so that

112
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,900
company and several others have tried to
tell us this is what the apt looks as

113
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:11,930
the FBI wanted poster for the Chinese
PLA responsible for hacking militia

114
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,310
here's the reality ok more times than
not you're going to have an advanced

115
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:25,350
persistent threat looks more like you
know it's the reality is I think I think

116
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,820
the the Internet in particular and in
our news corporation's have done a

117
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,950
really great job of convincing us that
advanced persistent threat means that

118
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:42,500
they're sophisticated this is
sophisticated this is not and that's the

119
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,860
problem is that we use the same term for
both and so companies can sell products

120
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,980
for lots of money and convince
government agencies that they you know

121
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,360
that their products are secure and the
protect them from these things but the

122
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,990
reality is they may protect them from
this but they will not protect them from

123
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:09,830
this I think we've seen that and some of
those companies same practices in their

124
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:17,959
security of their own security products
recently just maybe it's a new marketing

125
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:24,380
term I googled advanced persistent
threat and had half a page from like

126
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:31,330
everybody from he looked at Spire I run
on top and Cisco and you know it's

127
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,550
coming up that I don't know anybody tell
me anything

128
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:49,130
apt answers so if apt apt drives me nuts
there's one word that's nothing to do

129
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:58,649
it's very peripheral 22 security and at
the cloud yes the grown

130
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:05,579
so the internet right i mean

131
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,749
computing so the reality is we've been
referring to networks in some way shape

132
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:14,139
or form as clouds going back to the
ARPANET days you look at some of those

133
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,509
hand-drawn pictures and he hears
mysterious network it looks like a cloud

134
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:22,319
we've been doing that for a long time

135
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:26,819
the reality is the types of services
they've been offering existed all the

136
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:30,899
way back to the seventh straight I mean
IBM and death made a lot of money doing

137
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,829
time sharing services and you know your
time on the mainframe by one hell of a

138
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:42,199
lot like i dont wanna go to server farm
over time from Amazon nobody reinvented

139
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,790
the wheel when cloud computing came out
they just took a forty year old idea and

140
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,720
called it something new and different
now it's grown a lot since then because

141
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,600
it's not just posted computing time in
amore I mean there's hosted

142
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,579
infrastructure their social services or
so everything but I think the important

143
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,920
thing to remember is there is no cloud
it's just somebody I I still love that

144
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,860
sticker and one for my computer because
the reality is you're lying and somebody

145
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,339
else for security at that point and so
this is one of the things that drives me

146
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,499
nuts people say oh we're more secure
because when the clouds as I so you're

147
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:27,279
trusting that Amazon or Google or
Microsoft whoever services you're paying

148
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,860
for her for more secure than what you
could host internal and so that's just

149
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,269
it's one of those miss its kind of grown
up over some people don't get me wrong

150
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:39,610
it's probably true if you're in a small
company and you don't have the money

151
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:46,799
funds or resources for huge security
team odds are hosting and Google or

152
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,990
Amazon or wherever is better for you
because the reality is that they do have

153
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:59,600
actually do have people but like Amazon
says it's a shared responsibility

154
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,839
responsible for their shit and not for
what you put up in the club so if you

155
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,179
can't secure your servers it is a matter
for the cloud or during your your your

156
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:08,889
site

157
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:15,910
you know nothing's gonna change that the
other side to it is actually look like

158
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,689
you know doesn't look like a nice clean
data center that's you know managed

159
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:25,689
security lockdown or does it look like
some guys got motherboard sitting on top

160
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:34,529
of computer cases sitting in his bedroom
closet you know this is you know it's

161
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:41,689
it's exactly like this you know it's
it's one of those things where a lot

162
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:47,399
gets lost because we were mystified and
change stuff and things like that

163
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,869
earlier 5 p.m. and Dec having time
sharing services

164
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:54,899
we've had hosted services since
beginning of the internet so it's always

165
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,669
been something that's available just now
we've given a new name and we've tried

166
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:03,639
to sell it is something new and
different but really the same thing with

167
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:10,850
the same problems but by renaming it is
a great example so look at Blackwater

168
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,839
huge scandal other issues what they
wanted doing they remain themselves and

169
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,160
everybody forgets what the hell they did
it's it's the same you know corporations

170
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,459
do this all the time with themselves so
then somebody realized we just rename

171
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,309
our products and rename our services and
the things that people used to hate

172
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:31,179
because they didn't control them

173
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:38,939
love because they don't control so a lot
of it is all about how you can save

174
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:45,199
yourself the internet everywhere and I
guess it wasn't the internet was for

175
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,439
things I hate the word things about the
Internet of Things that raised me better

176
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:56,699
than anything you know not so much that
everything has an interdiction so much

177
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:00,039
as the fact that we've used this term
that is so generic it doesn't really

178
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:06,429
describe what we're talking about a
bunch of really crappy devices built by

179
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:10,509
companies that have no business building
anything that's cuter and putting it

180
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:15,529
into something that has no business
having a computer and then selling it to

181
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:19,539
people as if something you know whether
it's your internet-connected

182
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,640
refrigerator

183
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:29,870
toaster oven and when I heard there was
an interconnected just like it's you

184
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,900
know the internet-connected thermostat

185
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,920
I love technology computers but the
second I first heard about nest I was

186
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:43,190
like that is the dumbest damn idea ever
hurt so the reality is there's little

187
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,150
concern for security company is there
the whole intent in the whole vision is

188
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,970
work providing convenience to people
making stuff easier and made this

189
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:00,110
argument that there is this that
convenience and security are usually two

190
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,110
mutually exclusive things that cannot
coexist

191
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,920
the trick is to find the point where
convenience and security for both

192
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,510
unacceptable levels the sad thing is
with the interface there is no concern

193
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:23,670
whatsoever for security more times so
I'm gonna go my own internet blackjack

194
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:33,020
and hookers and blow i mean that's
exactly and like I said look up and say

195
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,130
what the hell are these things why do we
need them

196
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,620
wired internet works and those are the
questions that when anybody mentions the

197
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,190
Internet of Things you should be asking
and when somebody comes to your office

198
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,490
interests so your product that says
they're gonna help you secure the

199
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,140
internet things you should be asking
yourself to even have internet things in

200
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,560
our office and then if you do should go
find them the love of god those things

201
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,570
have no business on a corporate network
ever in your home network greet you want

202
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,460
to screw up your own stuff do it I don't
care but in a corporate network you have

203
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,840
no business with an inner bridge do
business with you know anything being

204
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:16,510
interconnected that is not important to
the execution job function of the next

205
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,110
one

206
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:27,080
people who do this are in the room call
social engineering when it is god dammit

207
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,350
you're paid con man I think the damn
term you're not an engineer to engineer

208
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:38,309
ship and I'm sorry man around for a
second I have an engineering degree of

209
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:47,720
people who a bachelor's degrees can help
me now to engineer anything came up with

210
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,890
this definition actually look this one
up but i think is pretty accurate you're

211
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,070
basically taking advantage of the
inherent trust the most people in the

212
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,799
world have somebody else you can go read
psychology paper after psychology paper

213
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:07,110
represent college ppl renewal see people
are always going to want to trust the

214
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,960
next person and what's worse is when you
put yourself in situations were you show

215
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,030
them you have some commonality the road
to trust you even more

216
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,160
the exact study but it was essential and
ones like well if I when they went in

217
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:30,040
they said this group of people do XYZ
for Sir lines and you know the gauge how

218
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,070
often the response and then they went
back to them and they came in and said

219
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:39,000
they had some commonality like oh we
went to the same college we went you

220
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,669
know we came from the same town and
they've created this bond in this

221
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:46,059
connection and all that is done as
strength in this matter like this person

222
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:52,120
is someone and and so now they've
created this this bond that you don't

223
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,500
want to just trust them your like will I
know the people at school from that town

224
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,220
or wherever and I'm I trust them cause I
want people to trust me and that's where

225
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,840
I'm from

226
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,890
that's what I do and so because of that
you know it's it's one of those things

227
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:19,200
that it drives me nuts

228
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:28,519
thing about social engineering is
obvious services that basically this

229
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:35,340
offer to work and come in a socially
engineer from my perspective I think

230
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,130
it's good because your security guards
are really your first and sometimes when

231
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,080
a defense about getting into a building
access and those who when it comes to

232
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,330
computers I don't like it as much and
here's why people are always going to

233
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:57,340
click on stuff I do not care how much
you do you run set against the office I

234
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,450
don't care how much you run SEC
exercises the reality is people are

235
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,010
always going to click on something it's
just a matter of how much effort are

236
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,600
people going to put in to get you to
click that there's a great quote I

237
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,580
remember once when I was in college

238
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,419
business from the registry the wizardry
compiled with said programming today is

239
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,299
a race between software engineers
striving to build bigger and better

240
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,850
idiot proof programs and the Universe
trying to produce bigger and better

241
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,529
titties so far the Universe is winning
I'm here to tell you

242
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:33,309
security it is the exact same way we can
do everything you want you can build

243
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:36,250
better training programs you can build
better software you can build better

244
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,490
better protection mechanisms but the
reality is going to be somebody sitting

245
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,169
on the other side of the people I don't
want to rip where users but mitigate the

246
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:53,320
actions not the people you're never
gonna mitigate the people very short of

247
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,970
firing and rehiring and finding people
euro but you're never gonna fix the

248
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,159
problem if you want to fix the problem
you need to make it so that when they

249
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,309
click on shit it doesn't load something
clicked on shit for the first time tried

250
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,590
to run guess what are weight lifting
stopped it or something stopped for love

251
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,769
of God just make it harder to reality is
for most people in this room

252
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:18,940
the the people that are gonna be
targeting here are going to be

253
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:25,010
those five Chinese PLA people I showed
you pictures of about ten sites ago it's

254
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,270
going to be that script kiddie who has
nothing better to do

255
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:33,810
who found set and found a way to attack
that's that's what most of your targets

256
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:40,650
going to be the reality is that it's
your gonna get three in my mind there

257
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,670
are three levels of it you're going to
get your going to get your nation states

258
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:51,550
and you're going to get your criminals
you're going to get the ones who want to

259
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:58,110
steal your personal information so they
can sell it on the black darkness and

260
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:07,580
thank you so they can sell it to the
consulting on mine yes the cyber black

261
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:13,470
market so you're going to get people
those who are three levels and let me

262
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,910
tell you the first to two of those they
just want quick and easy they want to

263
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,080
find the lowest hanging fruit attack
those networks get that information so

264
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,580
they can turn around the script kiddie
can go into four channel be like and the

265
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,740
guy who still in the PII can go in and
he can go in turn around and sell it for

266
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,760
you know a couple thousand dollars they
don't want to spend days or weeks or

267
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,480
months trying to get extra information
they just want to qwixcore so they can

268
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,470
get their money or get their notoriety
the ones you need to worry about the

269
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,960
more organized ones who actually have an
intense because those are the ones who

270
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,810
are going to spend the time to find a
way to get your people they're going to

271
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:04,450
find a way to do stuff and ultimately
you know what I C training does it it

272
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:10,900
helps people to avoid the Nigerian
prince but that's really it it it's

273
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,190
never ultimately if you're going to get
to a point where someone is going to be

274
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,030
able to build enough trust with at least
one user to get them to click if you

275
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,430
want to worry about Jesse training worry
about a tremendous traitor levels

276
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,140
because the people that when they get
popped they now have credit for the

277
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,410
entire network

278
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,220
if you're smart and your users don't
have credit beyond their local systems

279
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:39,090
and no real permissions outside of that
then they can pop them all day you're

280
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,570
gonna get reports from your logs when
they get popped and you're gonna go and

281
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,450
say ok we're disconnected from the
network and we're going to explain to

282
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:57,680
you why you what you did was bad and
we're gonna move on so why can't we get

283
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:04,000
rid of its it's really the same reason
that this exists and I'm not going to

284
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,930
get to a flame war about it but the
reality is they both exist because the

285
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,970
decision-makers your old white guys who
don't know crap about anything except

286
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:26,520
making someone so I want to apologize
first to any salesmen who are in the

287
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:34,710
room this doesn't apply to all of them

288
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:42,840
musical background it it may not enjoy
that as much as I do thank you I was

289
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,420
actually surprised nobody had created
this is a mean for many great things

290
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:52,300
about having trouble actually had
created the reality of cells make their

291
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,910
money on commission their job is to sell
a product so they can get more money at

292
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,650
the end of the day

293
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,390
now some people I have met them have a
good friend who was a sales engineer and

294
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:10,320
he says product into something you will
say it can't do it and doesn't try to

295
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:20,110
sell people on stuff that the product
that he supports can't do and he sell

296
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:25,660
something that he believes that's
important thing from his perspective but

297
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:31,130
there are a lot of sales people with the
end of the day went to the highest honor

298
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,830
in their office who want to make the
most money they're basically used car

299
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,550
salesmen who have gone from selling used
cars to selling you know cyber yes

300
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:47,220
because cyber makes more money and makes
it faster rate I can go sela $15,000

301
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,140
Peter I can go so you know make it ten
million dollar sell to the us-

302
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,640
government and some large corporation
and you know make more money selling you

303
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:04,290
know a dozen cars you know it's one of
those things where do things will make

304
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,510
outrageous claims will try to convince
you have a problem that you may not have

305
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:15,000
to it it's not always their fault

306
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,730
a lot of these large companies have
training program where you become a

307
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,430
salesman you go off to salesmen and they
teach you everything they want you to

308
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,430
know about selling this product and
those things some of things they tell

309
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:38,510
you that stuff can do it may not be lies
but it's it's probably borderline and

310
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,180
ultimately what happens when you get
that kind of slick salesmen a con man in

311
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:48,270
your office this is what happens the
executives just say shut up and take my

312
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:56,880
money and the reality is money makes the
world go round rate companies want to

313
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,960
make a lot of money

314
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,990
other companies want to save some money
so the people selling the products they

315
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,980
want to make their money you want to
keep all your money if you don't want to

316
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:15,570
spend as much money so about us and and
the reality is snappy languages you know

317
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:22,500
buzzwords improved faves heck of alot
cheaper spending time to innovate the

318
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,420
reality of the situation I it's going to
cost me

319
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,330
tens of thousands if not millions of
dollars to pay a couple engineers to

320
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,240
make something new

321
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:39,620
incredible and continue to grow Dr girl
product but if I have to I can sell

322
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,480
people on something I can make a lot
more money and it's cheaper for me to

323
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,540
pay a couple of girls standing on my
booth for weekend but it is for me to

324
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,430
actually

325
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,700
engineers to do so

326
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:59,250
work so the site looks a little cut
short and actually think it repeats of

327
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:07,070
on the next one so I'm sure there'll be
is education is a lot of it to you might

328
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:15,590
have time to secure technically they may
have outdated out of touch information

329
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:21,690
it's a sold the small problem right one
of us in this room party faces which is

330
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,640
sometimes you have to do you wanna be a
manager if your technical hands on her

331
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:32,380
first inclination but the reality is
some point somebody had to do that job

332
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:38,360
and you know maybe they have less time
to be technical and I've had plenty of

333
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,620
managers who are the important thing is
to have known as management understands

334
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:48,050
our shortcomings that works out fine
when they don't they don't rely on the

335
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:55,980
people that stuff so

336
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:02,549
destroying the buzz of us who is used to
tell me bring me solutions not problems

337
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:10,169
and so I feel pretty crappy busted up
here for 45 minutes and just ranted and

338
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:14,020
raved like I have for the first 30 of
this and didn't come up with at least

339
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:20,780
some idea of how we fix so there's a
couple things I've decided that you know

340
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,549
we need to not do we're all guilty of it
I'm guilty of a businessman half my time

341
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,040
standing up here doing it

342
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,210
people constantly use the phrase echo
chamber we kind of created at these

343
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:39,309
conferences as well so things you should
not do the needless pitching

344
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:47,640
everywhere and we're like minded company
it's fine but when we go back to work

345
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,270
and you're dealing with management and
you're dealing with non-technical

346
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,790
persons this doesn't do anything
ultimately makes us look bad it makes

347
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,950
our opinions look worthless it does a
lot to hurt our own image and doesn't do

348
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:11,020
much to help her find a similar invented
that is is acting disgusted and acting

349
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:17,919
with distain you know if that's not
appear a bit about a couple companies

350
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,660
and it may be very heavily at the
company's I'm talking about and even

351
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,030
mention of you by name but the reality
is doing that in your work environment

352
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,190
again it creates a much of the same
atmosphere right if if you're the person

353
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,070
is constantly bitching this constant
complaining who seems to do nothing but

354
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,870
attack and doesn't come in and offer
support and offer solutions you're just

355
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,870
gonna get dismissed maybe not at first
but over time it will happen I feared it

356
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,870
happening to me and my last job no
relation to technical work relation to

357
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,940
other matters and got to the point where
I felt I don't feel like anything

358
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,160
changing when I complain maybe I'm just
being ignored at this point and so if

359
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,179
you start creating so much noise is that
the camp that nobody can identify when

360
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:04,290
you have a legitimate complaint forces
when

361
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:09,750
you know in my case when it's just joy
being Joe anymore showed up if they

362
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,070
can't differentiate that and you don't
create an environment that can be

363
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:18,620
differentiated then you're going to
you're going to get to a point where

364
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:26,350
nobody's going to take it seriously and
it was fun to listen to what you have to

365
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:34,210
get katzen it's talking about other
people in your office talking about you

366
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:40,700
know that stupid management of ours all
those idiots making the decisions facing

367
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:47,390
away money on you know be Christians
took some ribbing islander wherever the

368
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:52,070
hell and bitching about that sort of
stuff about your company bitching about

369
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:57,010
the products that you're looking at
about the you know though I had a

370
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,040
horrible interaction with their support
I one-timer their sales guy did this for

371
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:06,440
a show to go to that if if you're going
to do stuff like that it's important to

372
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,420
have information tobacco what you're
saying

373
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,700
ad hominem attacks is not going to you
need to be able to provide factual

374
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,050
information as to why you think
something is a bad idea or product isn't

375
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:26,020
good or why you don't need to spend the
money so it's very important that the

376
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:32,400
more the less we sound like we do when
we're here and we've been bitching cyber

377
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,760
you know those audible groans that's
great here it's fine

378
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,600
get out to as many condoms you can and
do that you have to go to three or four

379
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,570
years if you don't do it at your office

380
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,770
great the second you start doing it at
your office all the time you start to

381
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:53,550
lose any sort of credibility and we just
look like a bunch of like you know you

382
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:59,040
know complaining idiots who just want
you know you know about everybody else

383
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,390
in the office but we're not problem it's
a thing where if if you start to think

384
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,899
everybody's crazy except you maybe
you're the one who's crazy

385
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,690
that's that's what they're going to
start thinking is what you guys must be

386
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:17,240
nuts because you keep telling us for all
the crease so what should the first

387
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,980
thing is to educate every hope enable
your management to make smarter

388
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:29,359
decisions you know make sure that they
that that they know what you need to

389
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,010
make sure that they know what's going on
if you see some some news article or

390
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:35,569
something

391
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:38,789
mentioned on Twitter that impacts your
business

392
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:42,760
make sure your management season make
sure your management not saying send

393
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,260
them everything about every new 0 data
just got thrown out there if you see

394
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,049
some big life changing things that might
change the way your company does

395
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,899
business change the way that you're
you're doing so

396
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:59,140
workforce management and make sure they
understand the issues and then work with

397
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:06,309
them to help solve whatever those issues
are the relationships of your managers

398
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:14,569
technical resources with other companies
you know to have good relationships of

399
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:18,660
those if you have technical resources in
the company if you know people who are

400
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:24,099
engineers for developers or testing at
you know a company that you guys are

401
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:31,839
gonna be acquiring a product keep those
relationships fresh right things where

402
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,529
if you have people that you can reach
out to you can make you can help

403
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:40,970
influence what is your working on right

404
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:45,050
help others find out what's behind the
buzzword rate of your manager keeps

405
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,930
saying you have a cyber problem don't
Scott don't laugh and go drink that's

406
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:56,869
fine here but find out what the heck
direction do we have a system security

407
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:59,530
problem is there something on our
workstations that bad

408
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,599
do we have a network security problem we
need to put more ideas and we need to

409
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,849
have better log management what is the
actual problem because just yelling

410
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:13,080
cyber it's not as bad as you know going
into revealing fire caused about as much

411
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,990
panic so define those real issues and
help them to find those real issues if

412
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,480
they say will somebody came in and try
to tell me you know we need to get this

413
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,240
product because those points at that
company tried to come in and say that

414
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,840
you and then work backwards try to find
out what is actual problem you know and

415
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,840
then if it is if you need to do things
make sure that you work and I come takes

416
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,910
the next one which is engaging in the
process

417
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:46,619
many managers in the room true make sure
you have your most technical people or

418
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,849
these one technical person with you if
there's an issue that you're afraid you

419
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:55,830
don't know all the information to engage
in the acquisition of new technology the

420
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:01,119
reality is you need people who can who
can ask the tough questions and then

421
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,570
they can sense and people who will have
enough sense to know is the salesman or

422
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,890
is their sales engineer just
bullshitting about what it is their

423
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,820
product can do your best technical
people are going to be able to sniff out

424
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,800
that BS they're gonna know when
somebody's just selling you you know a

425
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,550
bunch of vapor avoid the condescension
and derision

426
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,380
I'm gonna keep repeating this we're in
these situations remain profession do

427
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,410
not get confrontational it does nobody
any good again this is the place for us

428
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:39,710
to do that if we want to complain to get
a couple beers with your friends

429
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,040
downstairs at the bar and talk about how
much you hate product caused those

430
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,300
bastards didn't do something properly or
they try to sell you some

431
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:55,010
BS and you still your network still got
in the car said earlier the Add Comment

432
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:01,150
look for facts and pass before if the
company uses a bunch of statistics to

433
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:06,810
reference wider product as great as far
as much details will give you you know

434
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,860
ultimately you'll find if you go to if
you asked the salesman for more

435
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,210
information they're gonna want to share
as much as they feel they legally can

436
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:18,280
sometimes because the reality is if they
think it'll make them the sale go give

437
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,610
you whatever it is you within reason to
get in but give me like a test

438
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:34,650
participate in the engineering process
when these new products required if you

439
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:40,980
can't be involved and acquisition phase
and in their actual decision making

440
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,910
process

441
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:46,960
try to get involved in the engineering
be sure to have these discussions about

442
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,220
the deployments how the system designs
gonna be so what's being done to make

443
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:57,170
sure that this new devices being secured
rate I can go drop you know half a

444
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:00,480
million dollars a couple million dollars
to put ideas all throughout my ginormous

445
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,080
network but if I drop them in place and
your engineering guys don't realize or

446
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,410
we should change the default password
from you know admin it doesn't do

447
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,510
anything cause now when the hackers do
get into your network they're just going

448
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:20,560
to turn off your IDs and that's
important thing right

449
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,190
hoping the guide the process ensuring
that we are getting that security in

450
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,830
from the time it's being deployed until
the time that its age and that it's been

451
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,640
running for years

452
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,190
encourage active testing and assessment
of products you know as you put

453
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:43,160
something new and if you have a red team
or blue team or any team but them let

454
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,050
them being on a let them walk on it let
them see if they can get it to do

455
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,510
something it's not supposed to do if
you're not doing that for everything you

456
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:54,160
put on your network I know it can be
shoot a huge problem but if you just

457
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,210
dropped a hundred ideas you know sensors
in your network

458
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,100
work and you aren't going back and
trying to figure out where these things

459
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,020
secured you've got a bigger problem and
that's when his work with vendors to

460
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,230
resolve issues that you find the good
vendors will work with you to find

461
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,690
something that is a security issue
that's a performance issue that the

462
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:19,000
management issue good vendors will work
with you if any vendor says they don't

463
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,800
want to work with you

464
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,610
worse yet they threaten anyone who comes
out with an exploit whether it's

465
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:30,150
somebody from your company and other
company or public researcher don't do

466
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,500
business that company they have no
business in this field if they can

467
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,430
accept the criticisms of their own
products and they can't accept that they

468
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,690
need to fix problems cuz if you're
selling security products and they are

469
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,680
insecure if we can't trust those
products how the hell can we trust

470
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:53,430
anything that's coming out of the last
one this is what you can do not I should

471
00:40:53,430 --> 00:41:01,480
do is not for everybody in this room
it's managed only so I know management

472
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,940
is a scary word for a lot of people have
done it twice and it is very scary but

473
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:12,130
if you don't have people who are
technical in these management roles how

474
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,870
are we going to get them there some of
us don't actually go into management

475
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:22,010
very become a manager if you're so
inclined become VP become a C blanco was

476
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,990
a CTU says the CSO whatever the
appropriate fit for your skill set for

477
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:33,520
what you do get involved and and and
take on those roles and learn if that's

478
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,520
something that even remotely interesting
to you if you aren't sure go talk to

479
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,840
your manager photo and find out you know
I'd wanna do more

480
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,600
manager type things I want to be
involved in these other situations most

481
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,960
managers are going to think over this
guy's going from a job

482
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,780
know they're gonna think it's ok in the
end the people who manage you and the

483
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,390
people who lead you want to see you grow
and if you're happy growing in a

484
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,320
technical rules for the rest of your
life

485
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,520
a good manager and good leadership if

486
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,980
you want to go into another management
roles and they should also be willing to

487
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:17,080
help enable that pass and so there it is
manipulating this process from the

488
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,830
bottom is very hard for it it's what we
come here at every Khan and we say the

489
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:27,370
same thing over and over and over again
the reality is that it's hard for me to

490
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:31,550
have a certain level influence when
there's a guy making two or three times

491
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:39,720
my salary appear who is worrying more
about about line than anything else and

492
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,590
sometimes those people have a vision
that you may not so it's not it's not

493
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:49,200
even right to assume that the other side
of the other thing to its management is

494
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:57,700
leading and you know you don't have to
manage people to be a leader if you want

495
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,890
to take on a leadership role in your
organization you want to help people in

496
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,450
your office get better you want to help
people grow and learn more and even if

497
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:10,460
that's your own managers go ahead and do
it going to stop you if you want to try

498
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:17,650
to to improve process you know I'm not
you may have to take some of your own

499
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,830
time I'm gonna be dead serious but you
know what if it's important enough to

500
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:27,670
you you should do it I'm not gonna lie I
would do it at my current job now some

501
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:33,040
ups and kiss my boss hears that it's the
truth if you like the company you work

502
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,820
for if you like the job you're doing and
you like the people you work with then

503
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,080
you should strive in some way shape or
form to lead those people to help them

504
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:48,200
grow to help them get better and then to
help and in many ways hope you're so so

505
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,740
it's very important to remember that

506
00:43:50,740 --> 00:44:01,420
near the end the ransom has done so to
summer be part of the process

507
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:07,790
don't act violently against it don't be
passive aggressive

508
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:13,680
and some change in the AM should admit
that in you know if you're not if you

509
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,640
don't wanna be management and your
manager leaves goes on to something else

510
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,790
for tires and a position becomes
available if you don't want that job

511
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,110
your friends don't want that drum who
are your coworkers don't want that job

512
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:31,960
if they're people you know are lots of
people here that you can be networking

513
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,230
with this week that you can become
friends with you can have this

514
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:41,110
connection with and you know that
they're good solid strong and they have

515
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:45,780
this desire to talk to them and see if
they'll come do that because the best

516
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,940
thing we can do is get more technical
people higher up the chain in will help

517
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,630
a lot of the props I don't really get
too much in the store before but you

518
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,960
know when I had the old white man store
but you're up my brother works for a

519
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,220
company that is very much based in that
mentality it is a bunch of old guys who

520
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:11,440
who don't have the technical know-how a
couple years ago heard about they were

521
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,020
excited they all wanted to have very
little technical understanding to

522
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:20,080
succumbing to has very minimal web
presence because it's still a fat head's

523
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,370
gonna go away and so for them it's one
of those things where they don't have

524
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:28,380
that those people at the top and even
the people who are in those technical

525
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,310
management roles for real to recruit and
so it's a tough thing for people to

526
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:36,980
fight against especially from so I'm
running out of time I'll take a few

527
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,330
questions if anybody has I have one side
a really have to get to wish like hell

528
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:49,120
Dave Kennedy wasn't really have a radio
can I please get there any questions

529
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:57,170
nobody ok how about my contact info for
anybody who wants it

530
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:02,270
you know feel free to reach out to me so

531
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:17,790
got three slides left forget dave is
Dave come

532
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:58,030
is what they know that is what they can
do and that's what you're gonna have to

533
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:02,600
deal with I mean it's sad it's sometimes
a reality sometimes you have to someone

534
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:10,840
become what it is you're trying to avoid
and so it's important to you know it's

535
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:21,040
balancing our it is is trying to trying
to balance at that desire to to change

536
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,320
the mentality but at same time having to
read into it to some extent because you

537
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:31,360
have those people who that's all they
understand that's all they know so I'm

538
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:38,830
totally running out of time I'm not
getting it dave is gonna be sad but

539
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:46,640
yeah david you're watching this is for
you so Dave Kennedy

540
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,920
thing about this for a while it seemed
to me that he was an inspiration for an

541
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:58,100
important recent movie character and so
you know any of the guys from hackers no

542
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:05,280
no it wasn't that is not good enough to
you know to be black I love you Dave I

543
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:17,910
love you I swear know how come nobody
has done this before I do not know but

544
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:25,780
let's admit it saves a hugger mugger got
three little twig seeking out for hair

545
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:31,170
dave's doesn't have as much as I used to
its and when this movie was being made

546
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:35,150
you know dave has done a great job
losing a lot of weight I commend him for

547
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:40,710
that movie was made a couple years ago
it was around on the bottom I'm just

548
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:48,310
sayin Dave Kennedy Euro so thank you for
coming out hope you find at least

549
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,050
somewhat entertaining
