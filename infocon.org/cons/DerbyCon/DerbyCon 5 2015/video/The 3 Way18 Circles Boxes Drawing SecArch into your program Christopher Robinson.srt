1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,770
that's pretty cool so I want to welcome
you here to track for this hardcore die

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:19,400
hard to be a good team for Lyfe yo so
I'm just interesting I was asked to

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,550
submit a proposal got accepted I thought
I would wrote a very interesting little

4
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:32,329
giddy about what we're going to talk
about my name's krob I do security and

5
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:37,670
stuff worked couple different places and
today we're going to talk about the

6
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:49,180
exciting world of security architecture
so this is kind of what drew him in that

7
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,680
tried to be very obtuse not really talk
about what I was going to talk about

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,120
what

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,250
so circles in boxes so everyone here
obviously is incredibly excited to learn

10
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:07,729
about circles and boxes but we'll see
how that goes I have a small little bit

11
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:16,259
of a warning for you I'm just a guy I do
some stuff hopefully today being kind of

12
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,680
learn a little bit about

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,990
interact better with the business and
interact better with our different

14
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,829
constituents that exists within the
organization so today we're gonna learn

15
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:35,920
about circles and boxes and lines
connecting service in boxes lands

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,470
collecting boxes to circle circles
inside the circles lead follow or

17
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:47,439
poisoning unicorns and pirates and
security architecture and ideally Wilson

18
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:56,140
told through the venue of cat memes and
other assorted internet things so it

19
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,430
short little survey here who here either

20
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,950
has security architect at their place or
your role is something new security

21
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,170
architecture

22
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:11,250
awesome cool cool cool so a lot of
people have different opinions different

23
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:21,130
thoughts on their head to your clicker
click damn you so I'm an architect in

24
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,069
that went off the screen that's awesome
so I people when you think about

25
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:31,430
architects I think this guy to do I
actually do work in an office just like

26
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,120
that in my underground bunker other
people might think of somebody like this

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,160
guy got a really cool protractor he's
designing a model model of a model other

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,760
folks like real architects might think
of this guy pretty amazing character in

29
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,690
the world of architecture but myself I
like to think of this filler when I say

30
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,370
architect the plane I'm glad that
they're so many architects here cause I

31
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,540
won't get tomatoes and pitchforks and
torches and such in the world of

32
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,100
architecture there are a lot of
different jobs and if you're lucky

33
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,959
enough to be an organization that has
architectures discipline normally the EA

34
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,769
the Enterprise Architecture at the top
of the world and then you'll have a

35
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:24,109
solution architects at my own either the
particular application or infrastructure

36
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:29,700
you might have infrastructure architects
architects and myself were in security

37
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,609
architecture and I think it's a very
similar disciplined enterprise

38
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,780
architecture because when you're looking
at infrastructure or solution

39
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,430
architecture it tends to be very focused
on a thing we're on online banking we do

40
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,130
the payroll system and those folks are
experts in a thing or a subset of

41
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,859
technologies whereas enterprise
architecture and security architecture

42
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:56,380
we have a very broad focus of things we
have to be responsible for but at the

43
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,960
end of the day we all just end up doing
PowerPoint and one word of warning

44
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:11,150
don't ever make an architect angry they
got it good so today we're going to talk

45
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,840
about our problem in our problem is
business is very complex moves

46
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,080
incredibly fast pace it's part of our
responsibility to help deliver cost

47
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,800
effective solutions to the business and
we need to tie together a lot of

48
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,190
different technologies or processes that
mean originally designed to work

49
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:42,670
together and I would say that one does
not simply catch up with architecture

50
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,540
and I propose to you that the
technologies and the amount of the

51
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,860
volume of people we have to work with
has far outpaced the ability to simply

52
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,230
sit down together in a conference room
in white board something out or go to

53
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,720
the bar hopping napkin out and draw some
little doodles the complexity of what we

54
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,500
have to manage the risks we have to
account for as far surpasses that and at

55
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,930
the end of the day our job is to help
articulate complex business problems and

56
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,130
I try to find procedural and technical
solutions to help solve the US with

57
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:28,060
models it's pretty cool don't call them
dolls so circles and boxes this is what

58
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,990
the inspiration for the talk was a lot
of what I do when I'm not doing

59
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,970
PowerPoint you're trying to diagram out
things and you circles and boxes and

60
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:44,240
triangles and rectangles and squares
which brings me to my first tangent so I

61
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,340
was looking for this graphic whiteboard
circle diagram and my dear friend Google

62
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,600
afforded me a large variety of
whiteboard things so I want to share

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,650
with you in my prayers presentation some
of the things we saw

64
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,889
a lot of the people and I T are amazing
are done by the way I can I know where

65
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:15,580
the best spot to be is how far can I go
through can you go all the way at side

66
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:22,900
track too but it's it's interesting that
the white perch fun you get to play with

67
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,979
him there some amazing artists out there
and I T Y or wherever some of the stuff

68
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:40,010
so impressive the small-school pirate
ship with butterflies and we can't leave

69
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:49,570
your Calvin Hobbes so my ports power
circles right so this is a model put

70
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,990
together by the open enterprise security
architecture group if anyone's really

71
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,770
worth TOGAF and the open group they did
a little project for security

72
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,919
architecture and this is a model of how
an information security program to be

73
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,300
put together on the outer layers of
program management and governance that's

74
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:17,430
the strategy that's the kind of the Y
and a little bit of the how you should

75
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,020
we should not go to jail for giving away

76
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,919
sensitive data stuff we don't know
violator customers trust and in the

77
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,229
middle of operations and these are the
guys and gals actually do stuff they sit

78
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:34,539
down the keyboard they types of mains
and they work through problems and

79
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:39,909
they're they're fixin stuff but this
exciting green box green circle security

80
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,590
architecture and from my perspective
security architecture is really the glue

81
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:49,210
that held together security program we
have to translate this esoteric stuff we

82
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:57,960
must be PCI compliant down to I have a
WebSphere server sitting on VLAN 12 with

83
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,840
these open ports so it's you know these
folks job our job again

84
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,940
incredibly excited to see so many other
fellow architects brothers and sisters

85
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,180
but it's it's our collective job to help
translate this complex business problems

86
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,260
and get it down to a technical enough
level that the actual folks that pushed

87
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:26,290
the bits can do the thing looking at a
slightly different way with boxes of the

88
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,990
top your program you've got the business
requirements and opportunities you have

89
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,240
compliance things you have to deal with
and you also have the constant

90
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,870
ever-present threat looming out there
and these are all the things that can go

91
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,960
into this the management program
management layer to go into governance

92
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,830
and help feed security architecture they
helped give us our or our action items

93
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:54,440
our list of things we have to go do to
fix the thing anybody here

94
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:03,570
Telegraph yeah took a file exists TOGAF
is a framework for doing enterprise

95
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,170
architecture it's pretty cool it's
similar to ITIL for those of you that

96
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,780
don't know TOGAF and actually there
there purely compatible but if you're an

97
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:17,990
ITIL shop took africana plugs in and
overlays it fairly nicely it doesn't

98
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,960
specifically address security
architecture with took a 491 they added

99
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,160
a chapter but before

100
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,510
TOGAF one through nine . oh it was you
should do some security that was seized

101
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,950
the sum total of stuff

102
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:47,910
yes

103
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:57,440
so great way for doing enterprise
architecture it's a structure it's not

104
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,630
perfect it tends to be a little esoteric
and cloudy as you know there is no

105
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,130
clouds just somebody else's computer but
it took us pretty cool it's it's a way

106
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,000
of doing stuff and that's a lot of DA
shops will adopt that the doesn't

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,780
directly speak to how security architect
music do their job though it gives you

108
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,110
some nice to hear some document types
here's a process here is generally how

109
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,090
the organization can run and that's why
we mention i think is probably a little

110
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,680
better

111
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,650
methodology for for us it works it it
from my perspective I I would advocate

112
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:41,020
not a framework for a methodology you
need to go for a best of breed every

113
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,080
organizations can be a little different
they have different needs different

114
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,710
drivers you're gonna need to pick and
choose the best of the best and that's

115
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,200
why lifeboats Absa has depending on what
you doin it

116
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,300
torches in the answering who what when
where why which is pretty cool its

117
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,270
people can relate to that in this is why
I'm doing this this is what I have to do

118
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:09,780
it if it works it helps so I rambled on
about this esoteric stuff let's talk

119
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:22,420
about some reward application this who
here works for either a government or

120
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,950
some type of financial services
organization so you may be familiar with

121
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,980
an organization called miss for those of
you that aren't part of the federal

122
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,140
government they do

123
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,700
standard a bunch of different stuff in
the information security space they have

124
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,699
a lot of really good

125
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:47,199
documentation on how leader a
prescriptive on things you can do so

126
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:52,410
missed a just-released the cybersecurity
framework and a lot of times but your

127
00:11:52,410 --> 00:12:01,269
gonna run into with business people but
we come at them with like Doc Brown from

128
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:06,679
Back to the Future with our helmet were
trying to talk to the dog park to

129
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,989
Einstein and they think we're the guys
with the tinfoil hats and because the

130
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:20,149
location has had the probably
well-deserved label where we are a lot

131
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:24,249
of the practitioners are in to fund a
scare you it's the end of the world the

132
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:28,850
sky is falling and the apocalypse so
when you come to your business partners

133
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,949
or you can talk to a developer hey
developer you please do this they they

134
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:36,989
tend to write us off cuz I think a lot
of crackpots so when you're trying to

135
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,999
justify I need to spend a million
dollars for this infrastructure to help

136
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:50,819
mitigate these risks business so that
they like to they don't want new off on

137
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:57,359
this remote mountain thinking crazy
things up so they want you to prove

138
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,989
you've done your homework you've talked
with other people you are following

139
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:06,299
sometime within this industry accepted
good practice and that's where the new

140
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:11,899
cybersecurity framework comes into its
not perfect but nothing nothing today

141
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,410
I'm talking about perfect but it does
help you try to organize things so they

142
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,730
have several functions and it got cut
off again man so you want you need to

143
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,059
divide up your controls and your
processes in to identify

144
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:30,660
unification protection detection
response and recovery I can fairly

145
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,609
easily give you all the things security
doesn't those buckets and then they have

146
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:40,109
this layer of thick all categories you
might call them business capabilities

147
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:43,570
depending on the parlance of your
organization

148
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,870
and it's pretty cool to give this list
of stuff you should do this is a good

149
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:55,000
thing that folks in the world should do
to help protect stuff and it's ok and if

150
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,340
you look at they also get into a sub
category level so we look at like risk

151
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,550
assessment

152
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,880
they say you're doing $3 billion
formation you're getting that from

153
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,390
different sources you're sharing
information they give you a list of

154
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:15,140
stuff you can do to get real there's
also this other fine group of ladies and

155
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:21,750
gentlemen the FFIEC so anyone that is in
the financial services industry so you

156
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:26,050
are there are a bank or you are
potentially major shareholder of a bank

157
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:32,390
you must follow you must have these
folks come talk with you occasionally

158
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,510
they are very kind folks and they have a
wonderful checklist that you have to

159
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:43,440
follow and they call it the fic cyber
assessment now it's it's it's fun

160
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,900
ish and end

161
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:55,000
you remember the NIST chop things up in
a certain categories in the big selling

162
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,010
point for the FFI cyber assessment was
it's compatible with nest it it works

163
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:06,780
with missed its wonderful except you
look so I've got cyber risk management

164
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:12,480
and oversight and threat Intel in cyber
security controls that doesn't sound a

165
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,030
lot like what mister was talking about
exactly this is what mister was talking

166
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,780
about

167
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:28,690
she saying what I love the white lady so
it's our responsibility so our

168
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,270
organizations are given this guide

169
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,280
operate in this framework organizations
given this guidance you must have to

170
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,920
pass this exam and compliance isn't
necessarily security but if you do it

171
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,700
right is certainly they help each other
out so what an architect can do is you

172
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,540
can take this general guidance we must
do these types of things

173
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,110
missed once this thing FFIEC once this
type of stuff and then down the bottom

174
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,150
here you can say I have these controls
we are doing these things so for

175
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,560
vulnerability management you know we're
doing patch management were doing

176
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,440
security posture assessments I have a
vulnerability management program i doing

177
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,400
these things you know the words aren't
exactly the same as these but you have

178
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,660
to have this matrix to help tie it all
together so you can go to the business

179
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:26,380
and say I'm asking four million dollars
because of this it's important because

180
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,640
of reasons so and in this group

181
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,690
it's not as hard a sell but if you get
into an operational group or at

182
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,480
Development Group potentially metrics is
really gonna be the key to help you

183
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,890
selling and then trying to maintain the
level of security that you want to cut

184
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,540
off the bottle bottoms awesome so
metrics is a great reason so I can say

185
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,940
I'm doing vulnerability assessment

186
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,460
everybody you know kept secret is he's
always patching

187
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:07,560
everybody has to have a patch manager
program you can't exist today is an

188
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:14,560
organization that patch they do it in a
policy doesn't mean you're doing it but

189
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,420
you have some documentation that says
that you're doing the most people have

190
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,540
tools and how do you know that your
patch manager program is actually

191
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,980
mitigating the risk its intended to well
you know i i my tool gives me report I

192
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:35,280
have a dashboard I can say I deployed
500 patches on 30 servers this month you

193
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,470
can kind of measure what's going on and
you can make a judgment you are we happy

194
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,150
with the you do we think we've
mitigating the risk here can I move one

195
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,120
of my eyes off of that and kind of look
at something else over here or do I need

196
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,110
it may be vulnerable maybe I have a lot
of stuff out in the DMZ and I have to

197
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,980
spend more time to do a process to spend
more attention over there because it's a

198
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:04,540
risk your party organization while I was
doing this coffee attribution to another

199
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,080
tangent one of the guys I work with at
Red Hat was computers ranting on Twitter

200
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,540
I know it never happens he was
complaining when one of our jobs and

201
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,840
redhead has been responsible for
incident response so we actually write

202
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,870
the patches to fix the thing so partly
to Bootle sorry we hope to help you fix

203
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,620
that so he was ranting about
vulnerability management and he kind of

204
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:36,900
summed up in this little chart do you
have a problem no documented in a patch

205
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,400
tell people you're done it's not that's
that's the simple against so moving

206
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:48,840
along so we talked about the controls
and your vulnerability Sands is a great

207
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,880
word is the sands top 20 so they tell
you here are 20 really great things so

208
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,800
if you do these twenty things you're
probably mitigating most of the risk

209
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,678
that your organization

210
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,929
and you can sit down and look at and
appeared to have matching sets can apply

211
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,629
to our vulnerability management example
this is a list of good things that we

212
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:14,049
can rely on its not a guess guess not
that crazy old guy on the mountain

213
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:20,879
screaming into the storm it's actually I
have this is the world relies upon sands

214
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:26,240
for good advice on how to do things the
right way and instead of me inventing

215
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,490
funny things we could do I'm gonna save
myself days of work and I'll say this is

216
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,850
a good enough list and maybe I'll just
one or two from my particular

217
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:43,259
organization but this is a pretty good
pretty good list of things to do so so

218
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,649
we have our guidance and we have a list
of how we can try to get to that

219
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:52,320
guidance now we need to find some way to
measure it and what I've seen with all

220
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,749
these days every framework has some type
of guidance they'll give you some way to

221
00:19:56,749 --> 00:20:02,460
measure themselves the maturity level I
prefer this is a Carnegie Mellon's and

222
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:11,350
also who's got their first this comes
from my but it was another or no I Saka

223
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,179
I saw actually publish this one too I
like this I think it gives you enough

224
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:21,769
meat that you can say you can kind of
want your controls in these different

225
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,340
areas and kind of get reflect on how
good or how poorly they might be

226
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:31,019
performing but as I mentioned several
slides back the FFIEC has a totally

227
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,320
different maturity model is different
names and categories and that's one of

228
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,369
the things that get you into trouble in
the boardroom as you come in and you say

229
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:44,059
this not somebody actually goes soldier
whose and download the FFIEC document

230
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:50,679
and he says well you said we're in level
two were developing but FFIEC says

231
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,409
that's immature or whatever the term was
so you need to make sure and state of

232
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:00,139
France with your prescribing if you're
trying to you're advocating a way of

233
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:01,400
doing things

234
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,920
make sure you say up front this is how
we're going to measure ourselves this is

235
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,780
a source of it again it's not me making
up a scale of 1 to 100 is this is this

236
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:16,050
is real stuff real people use these
types of things so what we can do is we

237
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,960
go back to the the next thing and I can
start to put in here is all minus

238
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,560
categories of Tony what to do you can
line it up with all the fic requirements

239
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,170
and here's what I'm doing to it

240
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:36,770
attention my list of sands top 20 stuff
to control and then you can start to

241
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,830
measure yourself you can give each one
of these are score so I can say in risk

242
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:48,060
assessment baby were awesome maybe were
of a three would be premature but maybe

243
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:54,880
my threat sharing or documentation isn't
as good one as well you can kind of

244
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,860
score these categories out here have it
roll up into a subcategory and then

245
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,740
ultimately you can say in the category
of identify our richard is 1.7 how happy

246
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:13,270
are you at a 1.7 I think a 1.7 kinda
sucks I think three great place to be

247
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,770
and that's where most organizations
should be at should be striving for a

248
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:26,320
for no one ever gets to 550 July no one
is perfect but I think you should strive

249
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,020
to ensure as you're going through your
model you're saying I want to be very

250
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,330
strong and vulnerability management but
I don't necessarily need to be as strong

251
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:40,680
in business continuity may be outsourced
that and the vendor manages all that for

252
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,980
me in a very robust well-tested program
so I don't need to be personally as

253
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,390
mature in that area so I can focus my
efforts and resources on something else

254
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:58,760
so now we're gonna change to the more
soft skills part of it hurting a big

255
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,450
part of our job so we have to think
these big thoughts we try to find these

256
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,430
frameworks that help articulate the
world and particularly the problems are

257
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,670
trying to solve and then we need to get
people to buy in because again we're

258
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:18,250
architects we don't do anything but sit
around all circle some boxes we're doing

259
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,410
the guy in the server and the guy
telling you should fix a server it's a

260
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,060
great idea

261
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:28,840
people should do that it's the
architect's vision architect's job is to

262
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,440
have a vision I need to articulate week
we want to be the most secure be the

263
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,650
best in you have the least amount of
risk in this area I think we need to

264
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:43,460
multi-factor everything in whatever you
need to have a vision on something

265
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,000
interesting thing about visions though
is this just another word for

266
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,620
perspective depending on what side of
the table you're sitting that means

267
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,360
something to different people so it's
our job

268
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,520
the architect's job because I think the
big fights how can we possibly protect

269
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,880
the e-commerce website how do I make
identity carry across a composite

270
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,380
application that sits on fifteen
different platforms problems that's

271
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,309
that's our job as big problems

272
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:28,950
my pal Philosoraptor likes big problems
if that was the case so you start to get

273
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:35,129
isolated you start to think about these
big risks what if china wants to steal

274
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:40,249
my lunch menu that would devastate our
cafeterias operations of China had our

275
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:46,480
secret recipe for Salisbury steak would
be awful

276
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:54,440
the circles boxes and triangles and you
get and I would caution you as you're

277
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,889
trying to be perceptive enough to avoid
future risk you want to avoid getting

278
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:06,929
stuck in the ivory tower and the ivory
towers where you get so so wrapped up in

279
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:11,369
academia or philosophical what if
problems that you're not really

280
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:13,669
addressing the business needs

281
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:21,679
how can I possibly make this Googleplex
sir talk to the flux capacitor you do

282
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,629
you need to think about how you're
actually going to address the problems

283
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:31,240
and that it it's risky and a lot of
enterprise architecture in security

284
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,409
architecture folks get a bad rap because
you're in this ivory tower your office

285
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,649
disconnected from your customer base
here disconnected from your business's

286
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:44,879
real problems and the solutions that
you're developing you're talking about

287
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:49,559
the problems that you're screaming about
don't really relate to what's going on

288
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:57,520
your business that's gonna try to avoid
that stay away from that the ivory tower

289
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,810
and an idea and when I see a lot of
Architects get into as you start

290
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,270
screaming about all these different
problems

291
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,270
oh my god this is awful this problem
here is awful

292
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,310
then the next thing this is just as
awful and you have so many kind of

293
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:19,580
critical hi issues that you're ranting
about that people start turning turn you

294
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,530
are they don't care if everything so
important nothing is important and

295
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,820
that's where I'm an advocate to you be
selective but we never can get rid of

296
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,670
all risk and any risk is bad but we need
to choose our battles are not gonna get

297
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,990
funding we're not going to get resources
they are gonna listen to us if we're

298
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:43,390
screaming about absolutely everything
you need to be selective in kind of

299
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,180
understand what your business is biggest
risks are but they're most concerned

300
00:26:46,180 --> 00:27:10,010
about question the advice here was the
picture ran to the day be very selective

301
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,860
in what you do what you want to remember
everything else get it documented in a

302
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,230
list of patterns put it in your threat
register whatever your doctor

303
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,390
organization uses for that type of thing
and periodically bring that out remind

304
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,390
people here we're focused on this big
business has to do this but that doesn't

305
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,400
mean everything else is just as
important encasement pull those out

306
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:36,260
remind folks and hopefully you fix a
problem someday so one of the other

307
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,750
issues bubbles up to the top list next
and you got to remember when you're in

308
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:50,320
this struggle you're not alone you a
person cannot do this job cannot fix

309
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,760
everything by themselves whether you no
one can know the thousands of

310
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,890
technologies that existed an
organization or the thousands of

311
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,669
processes no one person

312
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:05,919
and it really does take a village to get
the stuff done you have to build

313
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,119
effective partnerships your organization
so you need to build the dream team

314
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:16,049
you need to have people that are
executives and talk to the executives

315
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:19,499
and get your funding we need to have
developers that our partners that

316
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:22,859
actually can do the thing you need to
have people on infrastructure you need

317
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:27,230
to have other architects if you don't
have the buy-in of your different

318
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:33,090
partner teams you're not going to get
anything done so my advice to you is to

319
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,720
go out find those people that are
inclined to security they're sympathetic

320
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,159
to your message

321
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:44,220
partner with them understand their
perspective teach them why you have your

322
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,350
perspective and then eventually they can
start to do the work for you as well so

323
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,590
instead of just a voice now we have five
voices all talking in unison saying the

324
00:28:52,590 --> 00:29:07,559
same thing so you've got out and you've
built these silly a framework you kind

325
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,369
of identified your problems you
understand what controls you're applying

326
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:17,059
to them you've given them some some
level of criteria of importance or

327
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,480
maturity

328
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,759
now you need to have a process and
that's where software development

329
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,769
lifecycle comes in and if you don't have
an SDLC rest SDL

330
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:31,220
how are you freeze at your organization
you need to get one you need to talk to

331
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,379
your project managers teens talk to your
developers because if you can get baked

332
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:40,529
into those other processes in the
organization is just much easier becomes

333
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:46,499
par for the course so if you get baked
into the p.m. owes list of requirements

334
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:51,249
so we can have here in security
requirements baked in I have an artifact

335
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:54,379
I'm handing you a list requirements
let's talk about what's applicable to

336
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:56,250
this particular initiative

337
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:02,000
I get it in the beginning as opposed to
the day we're going live security guys

338
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,210
we're gonna turn this thing on what do
you think I think its ox horn now you

339
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,030
have you're putting a lot more risk than
you should

340
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:19,310
and the same thing is it if you get
baked into this developers practices

341
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:24,580
though some had a great talk about
security in our development working

342
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,380
together

343
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,790
didn't really great message if you can
get baked into the developers process if

344
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,280
you can get plugged it you can get a
tool that plugs into their I D involved

345
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,280
environment for their source code
repository that have two jobs done if

346
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,600
you can talk their language instead of
saying what abilities saying bugs or

347
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,900
defects it's gonna be more powerful to
them they're going to be more

348
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,520
understanding to do it

349
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,520
IBM had an interesting survey every
couple of years they come out with this

350
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:58,470
thing if you can fix a security bug
early on in the development life cycle

351
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,040
analysis and design if you can fix it
right as you discover it right as being

352
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,370
developed it costs an organization about
70 bucks to fix know a person about an

353
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:13,280
hour or so somebody's time if it gets
all the way into production when it's

354
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:20,110
deployed and live that same defect costs
around seven thousand dollars to fix so

355
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:24,600
if we can get baked into the process for
helping organizations save money for

356
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,480
being more efficient we're kind of
weaving in with the existing patterns

357
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,690
and processes and began adding values
fix it now

358
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,250
the risk is gone and we don't have this
additional costs we don't have down time

359
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,490
we don't have a fire drill we don't look
like the bad guys because we're

360
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,230
partnering with these folks its
relationships are critical to this job

361
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:50,020
you can't get you can't do it all
yourself

362
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,150
here's an example for sure boxes that
the artifacts for processes that can

363
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,470
help you know you've got to you need to
understand up here

364
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,100
your business requirements yet
understand what drives your business

365
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,730
I'm a manufacturer that has a different
set of risks and health care provider or

366
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:13,020
different set of risks software
development company you need to have a

367
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,260
formally documented set of policies that
could be one policy that could be a

368
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,830
couple dozen policies every organisation
be a little different but you have to

369
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:27,360
have some guidance the policies tell you
why why am I doing this in a very high

370
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,370
level of what you have to do and that's
kind of an Elvis over here on our world

371
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:37,289
has a kind of the guiding principles
guiding principles should support what

372
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:43,440
your business environment is and should
help support your policies below that

373
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,809
you got a program reference architecture
that's the the circle inside a circle

374
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:51,059
inside a circle we talked about the
beginning for me Ossa that that helps

375
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:56,190
people understand this is articulates
how we do the business of security is

376
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:01,880
how we divide the labor up and ideally
your program reference architecture

377
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,690
talks about if you have any legal or
regulatory compliance if you're using

378
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:11,970
any frameworks maybe we're told you shop
ASAP or whatever the whatever your mode

379
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,950
of operation is that helps get document
your program reference architecture that

380
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,929
flows down into standards requirements
and then as you're engaged in projects

381
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:24,490
those things those requirements it
driven into the solution architectures

382
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:29,799
and the solution architectures are put
together by a series of patterns that

383
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:35,980
the securities or use cases and those
use cases generally like to guidelines

384
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,100
and guidelines are operational
procedures and this little bubble here

385
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,520
should say actually do the stuff but
that says they would have told

386
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:52,330
resolution to put the same so wrapped up
so some final thoughts don't let perfect

387
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,570
stand in the way of good enough

388
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:02,130
we we are all generally either very
technical very passionate people we want

389
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:08,869
to build the Mona Lisa the sixth Sistine
Chapel sometimes a Denny's might be good

390
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:15,710
enough to build something a little less
don't get enough of the risk mitigated

391
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:22,040
don't worry about things that are going
to happen don't worry that the Russian

392
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:30,990
mob is out to steal Kentucky Fried
chicken's secrets recipe that you need

393
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,629
to worry about what you need to worry
about what the particular problems are

394
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:38,389
for your industry I would say I i verbal
fight a word today

395
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:43,470
you shouldn't community ties tribal
knowledge and this is where that's kind

396
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:48,800
of combats the silo that you see an
organization I have the WebSphere team I

397
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,950
have the.net team I have the storage
team we have enterprise architecture

398
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,310
everyone's kind of divided up this
little boxes and boxes don't talk

399
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:02,339
together very well and my suggestion is
we help become the glue will help become

400
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:05,410
that communication medium between them
and each one of those little boxes

401
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:11,599
hopefully they write it down but they
probably don't know they they have all

402
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,380
these little subject matter experts
these little areas of knowledge that are

403
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,010
critical to the business

404
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,210
my suggestion is you need to get that
that knowledge shared across the

405
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,520
organization you need to cross train
people you to share what's going on with

406
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,310
these different groups you to
communities you need to drive

407
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:32,660
perspective in the organization overcome
a legacy mindset who here has heard and

408
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:41,690
their date their job we've always done
it this way that's awful hate that it is

409
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,150
the worst that makes me so angry when
they say we've always done this way it's

410
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:53,740
hard it'll never work we we need to get
that mindset out of the organization and

411
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,920
legacy

412
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,079
mainframe necessarily but it's just a
static way of thinking he'd open up

413
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,380
people's perspectives and say we all
have a job we have we all here for the

414
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,400
business we all have different ways we
help the business but let's understand

415
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,210
that whatever we're trying to do either
we're in a very risky space or the

416
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,480
businesses looking to do something
really big we have to change we have to

417
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,140
adapt as if your static you're gonna go
the way of the horse and buggy and it's

418
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,869
everybody now as tussles

419
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:33,400
horses and buggies Amish and the Amish
don't really have computers engage early

420
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:40,109
and engage often most honest don't have
computers there take away I actually

421
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:49,670
knew a software engineer for idea that
was Amish he was kind of news on the

422
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,319
bubble engage early engage often in
their software development lifecycle get

423
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:57,950
in there as soon as you can talk to your
project management organization your

424
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:02,109
business analysts have them understand
where we have these requirements we have

425
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:05,799
these things we have to do whether it's
a regulatory thing I have to check the

426
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:13,460
box for socks for GLBA or just from a
value documentation as an organization

427
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,349
we want to understand when something
breaks how to fix it

428
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:19,490
advocating to get this documentation
created to get in there with those

429
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,680
people that do the thing and encourage
them to do the right thing

430
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,760
early and often build partnerships
outside your domain

431
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,280
find those security advocates find those
people that are going to help you and

432
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,849
you're not always going to agree on
everything but at least you can have a

433
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:40,740
good healthy debate about why somebody
may not want to do something and

434
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:46,460
hopefully the majority of the time
you're gonna help win the argument and

435
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,010
they're gonna help you carry out your
message help you do your job

436
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:55,360
and I'm subscribe to this methodology
you need to open source your security

437
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,620
you need to find appears that you can
share information with shared good

438
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:05,830
practices at my company we did this
really worked that might help you out

439
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,300
and you might have a great idea that
could help me out

440
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:14,750
you get back get peer feedback now
there's a whole information sharing

441
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,340
processes

442
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,260
FFI sack where they're sharing threat
intelligence get into all these

443
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,170
communities seeking understand what's
going on outside your world and as you

444
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,140
see things you should say something
about if you are experiencing something

445
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,140
share that with your neighbors because
the guys and gals next year doing

446
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,910
basically the same job give them a
handful maybe someday there gonna give

447
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:41,800
you a hand and I would also state it's
critical for our profession is to mentor

448
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,540
the next generation we need to find the
plane's rooms people that can

449
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,890
communicate effectively understand how
to do things and so that they can kind

450
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:58,940
of carry on as we get older guy as we
move on so if you take nothing else away

451
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:05,080
aside from Amish software engineers cure
all the things we are poised problems

452
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,820
like this could happen

453
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:15,270
Weekly World News the greatest so the
beer brand

454
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:21,210
take a hold of your identity in find
ways to communicate with others in be

455
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:27,660
that guy or gal and help drive effective
change micro book up on the unicorn

456
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,950
pretty cool

457
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:35,079
so this is how to get a hold me what
types of questions might have totally

458
00:39:35,079 --> 00:40:12,470
confuse you was that this was a coherent
guess there yes correct so the question

459
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,869
is that there are a lot of different
frameworks and they aren't necessarily

460
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:19,520
universally applicable and we talked
about the best of by prescribing

461
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,619
best-of-breed approach of picking and
choosing what works best for you so the

462
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:28,420
question is how ru mapping those
business goals into those capabilities

463
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:34,430
you need to provide and that's the first
and foremost you have to talk to the

464
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:39,089
business you have to look someone in the
eye and listen to their concerns

465
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:45,000
business people don't care about
firewalls they don't care about access

466
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,680
control lists they care about I want to
sell the thing or I want to move this

467
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,440
from here to there you to listen to them
understand what the business wants to

468
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,450
take a step back and understand legally
what are you responsible for my dealing

469
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,829
with healthcare information

470
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:07,380
well I better jurors help make sure I'm
watching out for him or you know I'm

471
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,800
looking at the privacy loss so I want
you understand what the business needs

472
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:19,490
what the rules are that's when you it
helps to have this partnership we

473
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:23,280
created a security architecture board
were invited a lot of different people

474
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,990
in and we talked about ok I went out
surveyed the businesses but they want to

475
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,940
do this kind of the playing field Berean

476
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,900
when we sat down and went through these
different frameworks for these different

477
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,160
list of controls and he said is this
reasonable and as a security guy I had

478
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,290
to do the bulk of the work ahead of time
for them but I would provide them I have

479
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,350
questions on these five things can you
give all show you everything but I was

480
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:51,250
specific one talk about these five
things and whatever else you want to

481
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,060
talk about when we built that list of
trolls are that list of things you want

482
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,200
to do we build actually built a road map
to help lay out what the Weatherization

483
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,400
need to get to beat mix that maturity
level we wanted and I absolutely agree

484
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,300
you don't need to be a foreign
everything I think you probably sheet I

485
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:13,120
think three is a pretty safe goal and
three is you have processes you have

486
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,000
documentation its repeatable

487
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:24,450
forrester automated everything so I but
she'd understand that's reasonable for

488
00:42:24,450 --> 00:43:04,970
my organization and across the board for
sinatra wanna go baby

489
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:17,410
and exactly you've provided them these
are guiding principles you help educate

490
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:21,880
them make the right choices and the the
danger is you might get drawn into

491
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,740
something birds to technical I should
not be the guy right in your firewall

492
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:34,250
rule anymore I was a Cisco guy like 12
years ago I i I can I can't do anything

493
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:38,900
I can show in a sec black and that's it
so you need to get this the right level

494
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,040
of technical people and also state the
most organizations don't have the level

495
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,760
of documentation they need to really
understand that solution and again I

496
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,859
would advocate all of you as you're
going through and you're working with

497
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:56,410
different architecture developers demand
proper documentation the people need to

498
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:01,560
understand how their app works it's just
not a box on a visit is this thing with

499
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,109
a thousand open ports and use file
shares talking to these different

500
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,369
services it is poked out to the Internet
talking to somebody else bringing in

501
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:11,630
data people need to have that clearly
documented so you really truly

502
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:16,920
understand what the risk is that system
outside of the box

503
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:34,440
any other questions comments made us I
do I actually there's there's a series

504
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,500
of books and its security architecture
patterns and there's actually three or

505
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,800
four of them if you give me your contact
information I can send you the author

506
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,380
really great guy I think he's from South
America but there's security patterns

507
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,030
and new security architecture patterns
and actually have one specifically to

508
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:57,940
services oriented architecture which is
pretty good I rely upon all those when I

509
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:03,079
was doing my architecture work in your
stuff and I'll let you know this week

510
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:30,359
question is a really fun terms but it's
kinda like Cloud it's very very buzzy

511
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:37,680
it's it's why I would say traditional
organizations should absolutely try to

512
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,900
find a way to better align development
operations depending on what your

513
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:47,150
organization is like how heavily
regulated you are continuous integration

514
00:45:47,150 --> 00:46:12,620
isn't a great choice for a bank
necessary

515
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:17,310
depending on where you're from

516
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:23,360
don't feel this pressure for DevOps and
as we're tools like containerization and

517
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:29,400
director Integration Server kinda helps
out but some organizations may not feel

518
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,090
that pressure or I get your health care
you you absolutely cannot the such long

519
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,670
life cycles and such heavy compliance
you can't do that and it but I would

520
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:44,760
suggest in order to training
organization to be successful you have

521
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,500
to adapt you have to listen you have to
be observing observing what's going on

522
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,240
in the world and I think developed as a
great there's a lot of good things in

523
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,500
the movement but it I have not even at
Red Hat we don't we have not

524
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:06,510
successfully deployed and where is open
source hippy dippy as you get but it's

525
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:10,960
it but there's a lot of great things in
DevOps order from organizations like us

526
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,850
your Google and its traditional
organization you have to I would say

527
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,370
again pick your battles find out what
what the pain point is is is the

528
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:26,860
business really upset that they don't
have a new version of software every

529
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,770
week if if they are upset about that

530
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:33,300
well what can you do what documentation
can you get what automation can you put

531
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,990
in place to help the developers be able
to deploy but also get all your security

532
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:42,860
scans on the back and you have all the
documentation together so I would say

533
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,440
they all I don't know there's no magic
bullet no silver bullet there but I

534
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,890
would say be choosy about what you want
but what you need to do and try to be as

535
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,060
adaptable as possible

536
00:47:54,060 --> 00:48:01,070
oh yeah

537
00:48:01,070 --> 00:49:25,700
so it requires a lot of work up front if
you have this library of patterns for

538
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,920
this reference architectures developers
love that stuff you hit this is I'm

539
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,670
telling you what to do but I am not
telling you what to do with somebody you

540
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:41,260
hand in the stuff and it's it's not
quite but it's almost a checklist you

541
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,790
need to do these types of things and
they like to do that and Solution

542
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:49,910
Architects also love patterns because I
can I know I often occasion

543
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,630
authorization pattern as I know what my
encryption pattern as I can just grab

544
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,760
the solutions I need based off the
requirements of the project

545
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,840
I'm going to grab these this library
patterns can snap together and for

546
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,840
DevOps especially you need to ratchet up
the auditing and the government's peace

547
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,370
much more heavily cuz you're not going
to be able to sit in on every daily

548
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,640
standup you're not gonna be able to
review every piece of code unless you

549
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,020
have a tool to do it so you need to make
sure your you understand that there

550
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:36,010
you're in for the long haul for auditing
review absolutely dancer question kinda

551
00:50:36,010 --> 00:51:12,330
awesome so I want to thank everybody I
hope you learn a little something hope

552
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,800
you like blacks are some funny pictures
have a great rest of the con- thank you
