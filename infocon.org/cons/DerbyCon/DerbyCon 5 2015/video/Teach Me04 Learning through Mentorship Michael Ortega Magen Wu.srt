1
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:41,989
he did very well maintained everyone so
hello everybody welcome to learning

2
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:48,399
through mentorship so we're gonna start
off and we'll introduce each other this

3
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,970
is my maternal sister Totenkopf to my
right here I did talk to Mom earlier and

4
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,239
she said thanks for allowing her little
cousin to come on stage and do a talk

5
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:05,600
with you so she is a consultant Robert
seven currently pursuing her degree

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:15,360
squats 333 kilos and she does she's a
fantastic human being we got bored so we

7
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,360
decided to read each other's BIOS so
when he's not a management at his

8
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,540
current company is by night he
moonlights as an international man of

9
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:35,010
mystery kinda like double 07 but like
further down the list like 22 and

10
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,950
together we work on the b-side Las Vegas
proving grounds so that's kind of why

11
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:47,450
we're here talking to you so this is a
mentorship talk right we want to stay

12
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,409
low and listen about not just our
experiences in the mentor mentee

13
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:59,740
relationship but also we want to hear
about your experiences as well as we

14
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,700
want to work with each other to build
relationships so that way we can help

15
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,479
each other learn and take these new
people are slowly getting a trickle of

16
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,879
people who are going to school for
InfoSec which is kind of weird and

17
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,950
although it doesn't teach them anywhere
near

18
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,860
everything that they need to know in
order to be useful in organizations so

19
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,170
that's why we're here so with that said
we want to make sure you guys stop ask

20
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:37,010
questions engaged in conversation right
this certainly we do I say hearing

21
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:46,709
dictates you guys so I think for me is i
i benefit very much throughout my career

22
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,480
to mentorship you know I remember when I
was very very very early on in my career

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,099
as an analyst why things is as I was
getting stressed out because we weren't

24
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,200
fix you know we weren't catching oh my
goodness the world's gonna end you know

25
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,890
when I and it was coming down to
business decision we didn't have

26
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,310
resources we don't have time and I
remember my mentor at the time told me

27
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:18,799
you know the avalanches halfway down the
mountain just wait and that really

28
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:26,600
helped put things in perspective to me
also asked as Megan talked about proving

29
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,680
ground has really helped us tremendously
learn about how other people learn how

30
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,579
to engage people and how to speak to
people so with that being said how are

31
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,130
we learning today so we're learning
through things like this people coming

32
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,579
here to Derby Conn listening to talks
listening to other people's ideas listen

33
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:50,269
to our experts say I was in to talk
about reverse engineering I don't really

34
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,450
know much about reverse engineering but
it made it motivated me enough so that

35
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,299
when I go home download some of these
tools and I'm gonna play around with

36
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,819
that and that's exactly what the second
part of how we typically learned is is

37
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,590
we take things that we're seeing other
people doing things that we found on

38
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,940
YouTube that we found out i excite and
we're trying it out for ourselves

39
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,900
there's a lot of on the job learning
happening as well

40
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,990
a lot of people don't know Sam and the
best way to learn seems to actually pick

41
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,210
her up and run with it

42
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,560
start parsing those locks are
understanding those feeds and what's

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,910
going on from there and also like we
kind of touched on earlier is the old

44
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,360
school hackers who have been in the
industry or the scene for a long time

45
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,590
we're mostly self-taught right we SAT
there be plugged away at the thing until

46
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,380
he finally got the show or something or
we prove her first I've heard we learned

47
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,669
crypto on her own but now we have these
new guys were coming in and went to

48
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:59,760
school right there there's classes some
of us are going back into universities

49
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,460
and teaching stuff so it's completely
different they might not have the same

50
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,610
mindset as us but they're still bringing
more to the table and we could benefit

51
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,020
from their relationship

52
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,750
yeah I just hired information security
analyst who has a degree in information

53
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,240
security information security officer ID
because they don't understand some of

54
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,310
the basic concepts they've never built a
system so this is one where I'm

55
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,520
currently mentoring him now to
understand how information security is

56
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,099
beneficial to organization so we were
curious ok well we know the different

57
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,409
ways that we learn and we know that
mentorship is a part of this let's send

58
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:41,960
out a survey on Twitter and see what
happens ray let's see what's going on

59
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:50,569
with everybody else so we have 63

60
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:57,059
well I'm here unfortunately one by the
video shows up and we had two issues but

61
00:05:57,059 --> 00:06:01,330
if you passport just a little bit before
the senate minute mark audio should

62
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:56,350
resume so open inconvenience

63
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,260
dress pants questions so he asked you
know

64
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,600
you keep a mint or from being coming in
manager well it's about communication

65
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,420
right

66
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,040
a mentor is someone who guide someone in
coaches them a manager tells you go do

67
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,130
this it's not their job to tell you how
or why you just go do that thing so if

68
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,410
you think of it as I'm gonna go on like
a nerd right here if you think of Sailor

69
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:29,660
Moon right you have Luna is the black
kitty and she finds Sailor Moon and

70
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,770
helps her a logger powers a Sailor Moon
and find other sailor scouts and

71
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:43,340
developing grow right so the kitty is
the mint or Sailor Moon is the mentee

72
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:55,990
did can I go write me I'll talk right
now so there's a lot of benefits to this

73
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,990
kind of relationship for the men's team
into the person who's actually learning

74
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,950
actually receiving the knowledge are
being guided is in person impartial

75
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,320
advice and encouragement it becomes very
difficult when you're in a situation to

76
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,540
be able to get separation get
perspective so having someone to bounce

77
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,070
ideas I understand something a little
bit from a more impartial view becomes

78
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:25,110
invaluable we talk about developing
networks and what time was just talking

79
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,050
about is helping others

80
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,950
comment or industry knowledge for the
benefit the entire industry building a

81
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,950
stronger support network through
mentorship and also just to build off of

82
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,900
impartial advice encouragement so going
back to know some of us are kind of

83
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,230
socially awkward and are dealing with
different things I for one am one of

84
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,210
those people who even if it's a really
miners oh my god I can't believe I did

85
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,990
this I should have done this this and
this and this and would have been so

86
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,500
much quicker it would've been so much
easier

87
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,060
etcetera etcetera and then if you have
someone

88
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,100
trusted who was in you go to the newly
ok I did this when I should have done

89
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,250
this and it's really all messed up and
it's nice to have someone there to go

90
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,420
stressing out over this it's not that
big of a deal you still got the airport

91
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,010
in you still got the shell it still done
or we still made the Sailor Moon

92
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:31,660
reference in the talks for the mentor it
improves a job satisfaction you talk

93
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:38,000
about peer peer recognition to mentor
something someone sees me to make sure

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,490
someone allows you to distinguish
between europe you and your other peers

95
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,680
so there's a lot of studies that are
coming out now that are like okay yeah

96
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,250
you know we we've done a lot of studies
we see that it's good to have a mint or

97
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,840
but now they're starting to come out
with more articles on why it's good to

98
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,850
be a mint or so first of all they've
noticed in the brain that as you help

99
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,990
someone it releases chemicals in the
brain that make you feel good about

100
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,410
yourself

101
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,230
ok I was able to help somebody in need
of not being you know a super big thing

102
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,440
you might not have been life-or-death
but I still help them out and they

103
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,810
appreciated it makes you feel good about
yourself and then also it helps you

104
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:26,210
build our relationship hour so there's a
podcast that armor guys mentioned in

105
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:31,060
another podcast he was on hold
management tools and he talks about the

106
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,630
three different types of power in an
organization so there's role power and

107
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,150
that's where you tell somebody to
perform a function and they'll do it

108
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,230
because of your role in the organization
ok you're the manager you're the

109
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,500
executive sonya told me to do something
I'm going to do it then there's

110
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,760
expertise power so somebody who has
established themselves in a certain

111
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,610
field when they say something you're
going to listen and follow what they say

112
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,740
so an example would be like if you sit
in

113
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,670
talk freely Chris Dickerson and he's
already being wholly do this on a red

114
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,640
team engagement chances are you're doing
ok well that sounds pretty legit because

115
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,560
it's Chris Dickerson telling me to
perform this thing on an engagement and

116
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,980
he knows what he's talking about and
then there's relationship however we're

117
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,839
over time as you're known as somebody
who's approachable and able to help

118
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,089
others it makes other people more
willing to help you out when you need us

119
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:38,990
well lastly I think if Saleh solidifies
your own knowledge for me myself when I

120
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,480
mentor someone it's very beneficial for
me to reaffirm hey I know this thing or

121
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,080
I was able to guide without getting
directly involved there's not a and let

122
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,500
me be selfish there for me as well as
outside of that confirmation of hey I'm

123
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,000
actually know something it's it's a
reward and it's it's something that I

124
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:13,830
get enjoyment out of it

125
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:29,540
that's a that's a great point in
avoiding a possible syndrome yeah

126
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,520
absolutely

127
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,830
a lot of us in the industry and there
have been a couple of talks about it

128
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:41,330
even where we talked about how we
struggle with no I can't talk about this

129
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:47,440
or I can submit a CFU because I'm not an
expert on this or somebody else on this

130
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,740
so that means I can't do it because I'm
nowhere near as much as this person

131
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:59,860
mentoring in reaffirming that knowledge
by mentoring and reaffirming that

132
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,220
knowledge it kind of helps relieve some
of that pressure that imposter syndrome

133
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:15,860
put on us to be the best you know better
than anyone ever was right so we want to

134
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:24,320
move shift in talk about you know what
the measure ship paradigm really is tiny

135
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,810
mention I'm kind of a manager so I don't
put together a slide deck without having

136
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,400
a circle diagram so I need to do
something like that

137
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:41,650
know what I really saw was really having
five stages in in a mentorship program

138
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,780
and and talk about each of these but the
really about preparation about finding a

139
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,180
mentor or about you know making sure
that you meet cultivating their

140
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,300
relationship and then making sure that
you have a clear separation and it's

141
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,180
also important to note that this is an
iterative process you might not go

142
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,380
through it exactly the same way with the
same person overtime overtime gonna find

143
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,440
a different or or you're gonna be a
mentor to someone else or to multiple

144
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,390
people so what's the first thing that
you want to do its really make sure that

145
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,180
you're prepared that's going to require
some self evaluation and and don't get

146
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,980
me wrong this is gonna have to be on
both sides both dementia or MNT need to

147
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,940
make sure that they properly prepare
properly prepare that means

148
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,320
understanding your values making sure
that you understand your your work

149
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,210
habits and style so for me I'm early
bird person I get off at 3:30 in the

150
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,530
morning and do what I need to do that
means that I should not be mentoring

151
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,300
someone was a night owl was up in two to
three in the morning when I'm getting up

152
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,750
right so understanding yourself doing
that evaluation also it requires you to

153
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,590
understand what what you're strong and
what's your weak points are and whether

154
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,490
that's personal professional

155
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:05,000
where you need to really hone in and
understand what's going on for the

156
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,060
mentee its understanding what your goals
are making sure that you're able to

157
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,660
clearly communicate that hey i'm looking
for mentors to help me prepare might my

158
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,770
first talk that's my goal in next 3
months goal and we're going to go out

159
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,370
and she need help with that so now comes
the question a lot of us were wondering

160
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:32,190
is how do I find my mint or right it's
not like the dr. Seuss book you know are

161
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,970
you my mom where you go up something
like a will you be my moment or just

162
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,340
especially if you haven't built a
relationship or you haven't been

163
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,450
formally assigned its kinda creepy

164
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,339
before so just rambling

165
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:46,709
come up to someone and ask that now
sometimes depending on the person it

166
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,290
might not be greeted him I feel like oh
wow that's really why are you so my talk

167
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:55,100
you think that I'm really not feeling I
have the free time I would be happy to

168
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,999
mentor other people it doesn't work as
well because you know either they're

169
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:06,499
traveling a lot or they have a large
workload or very have a large number of

170
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,009
mentors and mentees that they're taking
care of and they don't feel like they

171
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:14,819
could give you enough attention that you
meet so we asked how do you how did you

172
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:19,889
find your meant or well about half home
said that is a senior person on their

173
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:26,209
team about 25 percent said it was appear
in their social groups of someone they

174
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:35,839
met it was like Derby Conn and DEF CON
etcetera and then another quarter said

175
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,860
other and we didn't capture whether it
was a formal or informal relationship so

176
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,800
again we're gonna try this out to you
guys coming in a couple of shows how you

177
00:16:47,800 --> 00:17:04,220
balance your mentor mentee how many
people actually use that was was

178
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,439
actually formed death like a formal
program work

179
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:36,259
actually I did before I arrived at seven
and they did things a little differently

180
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,870
but I found this really interesting and
kind of helpful so when you first

181
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,730
entered the company you were assigned a
buddy for 90 days in this is the person

182
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:50,590
you could ask any stupid question how do
I you know lock my time how do i bill

183
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,259
expenses how do I do this or that and
they are supposed to answer with as

184
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,429
little judgment as they can muster right
and then after that ninety days it's up

185
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:03,879
to you to say okay well I've been with
the company for a little bit I really

186
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:08,519
worked with this I work with this person
and they really know a lot about this

187
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:14,840
field so I would like to identify them
as my mint or if they have the time and

188
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,029
they don't have there been over
committed to other men to you then they

189
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:22,509
get a sign as your mentor I thought that
was really interesting and then over

190
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:29,360
time once a quarter you got it was a
more formal meeting with your mentor and

191
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,139
you determine ok well I learned as much
as I feel I'm going to learn with you

192
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:39,179
and I'm gonna move on to this person is
my mentors and there's no hard feelings

193
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:45,059
and it was really interesting because it
allowed to continue to grow I think the

194
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,960
other two things as when you're looking
for men tour is make sure that you're

195
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,019
not doing this in the back you know go
out there and make get recommendations

196
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:57,500
you may say hey I really want to learn
AB psych or i really wanna learn

197
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,509
PowerShell go out to your local meetup
go out somewhere and find out who who is

198
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:09,460
the expert who can help me out who
helped me out understand this and also

199
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:15,149
we can text on this earlier is you may
require multiple mentors right

200
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:19,070
not everyone just like in our industry
right now not everyone is an expert in

201
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,909
everything having multiple mentors to
help you out there officially so don't

202
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:28,179
try to find a single resource to solve
all your problems are to guide you

203
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:32,700
appropriately and everything just not
gonna find it doesn't exist you're not

204
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:39,899
gonna find one person that fits all of
your learning needs right and hopefully

205
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:45,210
they won't get hurt if you tell them oh
well I'm

206
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,869
I'm meeting this person learn about this
one still meeting with you about

207
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:56,599
PowerShell absent so why things that you
want to make sure it is when you meet

208
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:01,059
that first meeting I think it's always
very critical to the relationship you

209
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:05,200
wanna go and use that use that knowledge
that you got in that preparation when

210
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,009
you were self reflective and thought
about what you needed about who you are

211
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:13,179
what you are and bring that in
considering how to market yourself how

212
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:17,109
what are you gonna tell your mentor what
what what what are you gonna tell your

213
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:21,269
mentee about your self again we're going
to talk about this a little bit later

214
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:25,729
but this is gonna be a very vulnerable
process as well you gonna meet you can

215
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:29,889
expose things about yourself the say hey
I don't know about this but I'm really

216
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:34,399
good at this and also it's important to
note that as we're going through this it

217
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:39,820
sounds like this really frigid and
formal process it doesn't have to be the

218
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,950
mentee mandatory meeting to be like at a
bar once every couple of weeks and you

219
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,779
know how are things are pretty good and
wanna learn more about this

220
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,109
oh you should check out this talk cool
what about PowerShell will you should

221
00:20:53,109 --> 00:21:02,419
check out of intense talk on saturday
that's so that check to clear yeah

222
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:21,609
the Smirnoff what time is your talk it's
near the pool on the roof

223
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:30,220
track to teach chocolate so if you wanna
learn more about PowerShell been

224
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:38,210
stalkers can be really good no pressure
next next part of the process is really

225
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:43,259
make sure that you cultivate the
relationship you know again that self

226
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:48,070
evaluations to really help you figure
out what's the right structure hey maybe

227
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,019
every couple weeks I bars perfect for
some people other people it's we need to

228
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:57,409
meet every Tuesday at 7:30 between 7:30
and 7:45 and we need to go through these

229
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:02,769
three bullet points and it really works
for different people in different ways

230
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:07,730
make sure that you ask questions and
that's on both sides

231
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,549
a lot of times people don't know what
they're asking for our don't understand

232
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:15,789
exactly what they need to ask their
fight questions just like if you were

233
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:20,600
completing the years security assessment
anything understanding you make sure you

234
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,609
understand what the situation is and
then as we discussed at a certain point

235
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:31,399
in time you might feel the need to break
off the formal mentor mentee

236
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:36,399
relationship and move on to a different
mentoring that's fine just make sure you

237
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:40,340
don't bring the ridge or Dubai all of a
sudden you're not answering each other's

238
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,919
emails because you never know further
down the road when you're gonna be able

239
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:52,940
to help one another is a really really
really small community almost scary fall

240
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,989
so if you bring a bridge with one person
you might be inadvertently burning that

241
00:22:56,989 --> 00:23:01,730
bridge with like five or six other
people who could have helped you or who

242
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,080
you could have helped

243
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:13,120
the other thing is is making sure that
that this is also why setting goals is

244
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,620
extremely important because you want to
make sure that that that separation is

245
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,299
not offered you don't want to cause any
friction between you your mentor you

246
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,519
meant to you having a clear objective
say yes we decreases Kohler know you're

247
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:32,230
on your way to making sure that
separation is as smooth as possible so

248
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,289
it's not all sunshine and roses right
sometimes we're gonna come across

249
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:40,269
different challenges and the release in
you know about finding someone that's

250
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:45,110
the perfect montuori more perfect mint
tea for us and some of them were just

251
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,029
make up talk about a couple of the most
common ones that we've seen while

252
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:53,769
running proving grounds so first of all
its level of engagement there have been

253
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:59,710
quite a few times where we've been
tasked with reaching out to women or men

254
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:06,090
to using hey we got reached contacted by
the other person here and they're saying

255
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:11,340
you know you're not delivering X
deliverable by this date to make sure

256
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,500
you're on track for talk or German he
feels a little ignored are you on

257
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,100
vacation you doing something it's cuz
you need look no because they're having

258
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:30,590
anxiety attack over here because their
talks coming up so it's important to let

259
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,980
people know about levels of expectation
like I need to have like at least a

260
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,139
weekly email to know that still gonna
help me out with this thing that I'm not

261
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:48,529
just drifting or if you say you're going
to perform a task or give them some

262
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:53,480
information that you actually follow up

263
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,929
the next one is making sure that what
you're saying it's clear that

264
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:02,110
communicated that's why you asked to
clarify questions that you making

265
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:08,400
statement sometimes not all what you see
is what you mean it is not interpreted

266
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,510
correctly so making sure that you're
giving the right advice that advice is

267
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,370
being interpreted correctly you're
taking the right actions and also that

268
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,919
as a minute to your explaining to
someone ok I want to be better a

269
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,710
powershell ok well that's great but what
particularly do you want to do with

270
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,910
PowerShell because there's a lot you can
do with it evidently

271
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:48,390
sorry but I'll be at your talk tomorrow
at 2 p.m. tomorrow

272
00:25:48,390 --> 00:26:00,140
track for an important to express
yourself on both ends and then sometimes

273
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,500
you're just gonna come across someone
who's really difficult who doesn't want

274
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,630
to work with you who's fighting you
every step of the way sometimes this is

275
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,600
usually can happen in the formal
mentorship programs like at work and

276
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,669
stuff you're gonna be a sign someone you
can't get out of it you're just like I

277
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:22,540
would rather chop off my left hand and
talk to this person ever again right so

278
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:30,280
we touched on this i'm sorry we touched
on this difficult time does the little

279
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,220
bit earlier but this is very much like a
dating relationship it's aku not

280
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,910
everyone is the right fit for you and
understanding hey this is how I best

281
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,650
work this is what's going on

282
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,250
may not is this person may not be beat
being difficult they just communicate

283
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:51,620
different fashion and that fashion just
doesn't match with yours

284
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:58,300
alright so we left a lot of time open
for questions and answers we also have

285
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:05,490
kind of a call to action where we hope
to see more things like london besides

286
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,030
Las Vegas and a couple of the other
besides where they take first time

287
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:15,460
speakers and pair them up with someone
in more stylish who's done it a couple

288
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,630
of times because it helps you know it
helps them for their thoughts more

289
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,280
clearly slides don't suck is horribly
and when you're giving the presentation

290
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,340
it's kind of nerve-racking so it's nice
to have a couple people in the audience

291
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,910
that you can look at you like ok cool I
have something on my side even if this

292
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:39,150
is the worst ever they sold off my back
and then they have feedback for me to

293
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,450
make it better for the next time right
and I think the other part of the cause

294
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:49,730
actions participating organizations like
besides dudu first time speaker talked

295
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,870
but also act locally there's a lot of
local meetup Meetups

296
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,160
cargo area things like curbside there's
a lot of great professionals are there

297
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,950
in the social environment that can be
your mentors that you can leave now and

298
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,820
get help and also it's nice to go home
to Derby Conn first of all how many

299
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:15,190
people is their first because

300
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:20,940
I perceiving come to every single day
becomes the first and I will i know i

301
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:28,620
will never miss it if I can help it
because it really is a tightly-knit I

302
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,480
have not gotten the scene by but any
other conference that I do it because I

303
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,030
feel like I can go down to the bar sat
down next to someone that I saw

304
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:42,860
present-day of hay or non-alcoholic
beverage and let's talk more about your

305
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:48,730
presentation and then not have him get
that kind of Rockstar complex you know

306
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:56,260
that's cool I'm gonna go hang out with
my friends over here a couple times I

307
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,100
don't have time for drinks right now but
we're gonna go down to GB and get some

308
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:06,460
food you want to come with and that's
one of the great things about conflict

309
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:13,020
mahler more intimate are generally
willing to help on the road

310
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:32,419
you know i text message

311
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:39,269
post on Facebook now you know I think it
goes back to making sure that you

312
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:43,480
properly prepare for that relationship
right setting those goals so it's not a

313
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,350
clear you know you're not just meeting
to for some ambiguous purpose you have a

314
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:53,919
goal and also making sure that you
clearly understand yourself saying hey

315
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,629
man I am up at 3:30 your you know not
giving up until 10 we you know we don't

316
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:04,730
have time to meet maybe someone else is
better for me or vice versa

317
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,859
and it's also not just about the whole
thing one of the best ways that I've

318
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:13,059
communicated with someone that I didn't
want them to be my mentor anymore was

319
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:19,789
just like hey I want to learn more about
this particular subject and this person

320
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:23,840
has offered to help me more would it
offend you

321
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,999
you know moved on to do you know we can
still talk blog it's not you it's me

322
00:30:28,999 --> 00:31:46,060
Luis Silva proteins

323
00:31:46,060 --> 00:32:13,610
program and it was run by Marissa fagan
doozy but fortunately for a whole bunch

324
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:20,280
of reasons it kind of came apart but it
was agreed because what she did was she

325
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,820
grabbed people who around the world
actually looking for 20 take some time

326
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:33,640
and mentor somebody and set them up with
someone was looking for a minute or in a

327
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,840
particular area India based on interest
she would introduce them so

328
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,340
unfortunately that's no longer active
but if somebody who has more time than

329
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,810
me

330
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:50,630
ya know like that is amazing I really
think it and again it's it's really

331
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,680
going through the process putting
yourself out there I think it is very

332
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:11,030
difficult for individual like myself
who's introvert can sleep left to right

333
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:17,030
but no it is it is putting yourself out
there making sure that you know I'm

334
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,890
looking for help

335
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,530
reaching out like I got my sector of
sight

336
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:28,590
those are channels on IRC that you know
I think we have folks in all of the

337
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:59,120
world globe in question back sir so
there was another talk or other

338
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,340
resources where you can learn about how
to be a better mentor betterment to you

339
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:09,690
in actually there's a really good talk a
couple of years ago by I was put your

340
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:15,980
name but she gave a stalker on how to be
a better man torment II and it was

341
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,919
actually I think it was like two or
three years ago if you want I can look

342
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:25,659
it up and then treated on my Twitter
account so that way you guys can go and

343
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:35,480
watch and download it but it gives some
really good tips

344
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:52,830
I think a couple of other conferences as
well so yeah we're by far not the first

345
00:34:52,830 --> 00:35:01,200
or only what they all are I don't know
but I'll try to look them up and put him

346
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,960
on Twitter

347
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:16,350
yeah well that's a great question
therefore be a couple of different ways

348
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:21,609
one really put you put yourself out
there right say hey would you like to be

349
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:26,750
my mint or to say hey I'm working on
this project could you help me a lot can

350
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,700
I bounce things off for you so you know
it really can't some of my meant some of

351
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,560
my best mentors 11 mentors where they
they knew they were helping me out but I

352
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,460
didn't say oh we might meant or if they
knew that they were helping me with

353
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:53,550
specific project specific thing yeah
yeah yeah they're probably thinking oh

354
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:57,359
ok so we would definitely like to take
think

355
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,180
confer along to speak on this topic it
something we definitely feel very

356
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,740
passionate about very glad especially
with our role for besides proving ground

357
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,830
we've done proving ground for three
years now we've been able to start your

358
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:19,109
30 restarting your 32 years so we did
we're going into our thirty year now

359
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:23,850
herbicides but we we in that time we
have helped over 75 individuals to

360
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:29,680
deliver their first talk along with
phenomenal people who have helped to be

361
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,880
mentors and there's nothing more
rewarding I think from my perspective is

362
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,250
watching these people come up

363
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,390
deliver their first you know ready to
give their first talk from nervous how

364
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,509
and a walkway just so release so and

365
00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:45,279
also I'm gonna go back to thinking Derby
Conn doctors for letting us get this

366
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:52,229
talk but for having the bible does a lot
of us have I know so many people who

367
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:56,319
they wouldn't feel comfortable speaking
at other venues but they feel

368
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:00,869
comfortable enough given their first
talk at Derby Conn you know going up to

369
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:05,630
people in approaching one another and so
yeah just all the staff and volunteers

370
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:21,899
you whenever they're just like to see me
or does he is he like your handler and

371
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:27,419
like to make sure that I get to the
place on time

372
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:35,209
also movie for being an awesome coach
speaker he'll open Ben 10 and random ppl

373
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:41,719
Derby Conn who let me kinda likes my way
into their conversation it's great

374
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:45,729
because a lot of people will be like I
don't know if you noticed it but we'll

375
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:50,529
have like a semi-circle in the lobby and
then if someone approaches from behind

376
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:54,969
and just gonna listen they open up a gap
for you to intern join the conversation

377
00:37:54,969 --> 00:38:01,209
and that's really freaking cool yeah and
I have tons of people like to thank my

378
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:06,059
family my mentors all these fantastic
people noted herein and the folks that

379
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:11,279

unofficial mentors as well and if you
