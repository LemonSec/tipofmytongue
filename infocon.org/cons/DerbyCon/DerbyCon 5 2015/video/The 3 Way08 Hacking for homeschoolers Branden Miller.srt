homeschoolers for those of you that have

4
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,199
hurt me present before I rarely do
anything technical as I'm in the

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,230
technical world like every day all day
and even after work so I usually do

6
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,550
something like borderline I talked about
technology but I don't do anything

7
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:49,070
groundbreaking so who am I i love to
wear a onesie drink hot chocolate talk

about health care of my family charity
consultant I work from home now which

9
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,230
are really love it took me a little bit
to get used to how many people we have

10
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,609
working from home was a shocker when he
went from like a corporate environment

11
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,570
to home it was but I did I struggled
with it for like the first three months

12
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,930
I was like there's nobody that's not too
I can't go downstairs ok yeah well my

13
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,570
wife actually put a sign on the stairs
that said school is in session you're

14
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,729
not all out so she knew I would just go
down there however so obviously my dad

15
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:36,900
after kids 15 12 and 9 husband Christian
and I am the official dean of the women

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,890
way academy and all explained that story
a little bit later how many people do we

17
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,030
have that homeschool

18
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,630
how many of you guys are in Kentucky
alright so you you said you had to say

19
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,770
your self upright did you fill out the
paperwork yeah

20
00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:00,630
yeah I know you're not by the way you're
not on camera so feel free to answer I

21
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,049
will answer according to what the state
says alright so officially I i'm the

22
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,009
Dean on the counselor

23
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,390
we actually do like the whole structure
because we make fun with it even my kids

24
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,670
are on staff so that's kind of how we
did it if you have questions don't wait

25
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,900
till the end just raise your hand right
there there's a lot of material that I

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,269
myself discovered doing this
presentation you know putting it

27
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:30,900
together and it really blew my mind
whenever you know I thought I knew about

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,730
the history of education in our country
because that's something that I was

29
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,239
passionate about and then whenever my
wife found out what I was going to

30
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,940
present on she said okay by the way
you've had most of it wrong here you go

31
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,079
my notes and so I was like whoa really
okay and because she has OCD she cites

32
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:56,129
everything and it's all in perfect order
was tabs and color-coded it was great I

33
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,250
want to go and what this talk is not as
groundbreaking none of the information

34
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,810
on putting out here except for the last
part came from me that all came from

35
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,260
source material that I have at the end
some of it I sourced you know at the

36
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,910
bottom of the slide the rest of it came
comes at the end of the presentation and

37
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,370
what this talk is we're going to talk
about social studies and history a

38
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,760
little bit too that's actually important
to understand why our educational system

39
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,639
is built the way it is today

40
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:32,160
it also ties into why my wife and I
decide to homeschool will talk about the

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,380
STEM program and some facts and myths
that are associated with the STEM

42
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,109
program talk a little bit about
psychology and then a lot about me

43
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:51,019
because I'm presenting and you're here
so it's all about me so we'll start off

44
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,060
at the first one

45
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,500
this is something that has always
intrigued me and I've always kinda

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,040
laughed about never could find good
source material but I found it so I'm

47
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,200
gonna sherrit show homeschoolers do not
score is highest standard on

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,739
standardized testing such as the attn
s80 as traditional students that true or

49
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,880
false it's actually thought of course I
cannot let you into that but the actual

50
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,500
statistics in this is from Princeton
Review who is responsible for one of

51
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,450
those two test will tell you that
home-schooled students actually score on

52
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,889
average 30 percent higher on
standardized testing have a theory as to

53
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:37,930
why that is and tell you a little bit
about that later so social studies and

54
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,990
history this is referring to talk about
the early school

55
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,090
the reform era as it's known as for the
progressive era as some people call it

56
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,800
and then home schooling and and how that
came about so early school I went back

57
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,060
as far as 1,700 try to find as much as I
could

58
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,000
1705 mid 1800's 1830 right around that
time frame

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,830
schools were pretty much non existence
only about 33 percent of children in

60
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,990
america went to school right now is kind
of a holdover from our past is same way

61
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,340
and English society only the the rich
people really send their kids to school

62
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,120
and they would send him away a lot of
times or they had a tutor full time they

63
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,330
are private usually very unorganized in
other words they didn't have a standard

64
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,820
curriculum they had kind of a what they
called the classical theory of

65
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,110
instruction which was just a series of
courses like Latin and arithmetic

66
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,740
English and writing things of that
nature

67
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,770
penmanship was talking a lot of schools
I think they should bring that back

68
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:49,550
personally there was no compulsory
education on average school began age

69
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,450
five and went to about 15 before he
graduated if you were in the upper class

70
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,849
obviously it would go a little bit long

71
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:03,929
they were prepared for college at that
point usually it was wondering

72
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:09,539
schoolhouse there were no age gradient
ur age grade system or systems at that

73
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:15,709
point and they pretty much followed this
belt Lancaster method which was the

74
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:20,619
older pupils who tended to be more apt
would actually help teach the younger

75
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:25,759
people that's actually what we do and
and and are going to my daughter who's

76
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,550
15 actually assistant teaching my nine
year old girl does two things number one

77
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,159
helped her learn the subject material
better and make sure often in the

78
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,709
subject material because she has to
teach it so it better prepares her for

79
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:45,769
whatever she's she's learning early
schools once again this about 1802 her

80
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:51,490
1837 1900 we started to have what was
known as the man reforms there was a

81
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,059
college professor in the Northeast I
forget what college or university he was

82
00:06:55,059 --> 00:07:02,249
but he went to russia and he studied
their school system they were supposedly

83
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:07,059
some of the best school systems in the
world they had a largely edict educated

84
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:12,849
population Z the number of people that
were literate or better than most other

85
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:20,249
regions in the world at that time the
known world should say he really pushed

86
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:25,789
for the same content and all schools so
he said you know we should have a core

87
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:30,639
curriculum you hear that again later if
you haven't already heard that in it

88
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,979
should include the following items and
at that time it was really the items

89
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,059
that a lot of the schools were teaching
so you had your arithmetic you're

90
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:43,619
writing your Latin things of that nature

91
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:47,999
it was the first time they began to
focus on teacher education before this

92
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:53,199
point most of the teachers are people
that were knowledgeable and a subject so

93
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,369
they taught school

94
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:59,589
the problem was they had to teach six or
seven subjects of your special

95
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,039
specialization are your skills in math
you were still on that one room

96
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,399
schoolhouse need to teach all the other
subjects were 82 like our elementary

97
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,750
school students now but in high school

98
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:16,010
all right she went up to age 15 they
introduced aged rating which was

99
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,710
considered you know each of your
subjects would be taught to a certain

100
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,010
age level when they would stay together
as they matriculated

101
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:30,020
went up to a different level that we
continue to have it today and in

102
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,300
nineteen hundred this is you know kind
of freaky

103
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,050
well first of all I had to go figure out
what states want a part of this in 1934

104
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,990
stateside compulsory education so I was
like wow that seems really low and then

105
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,440
you gotta realize swelling in 45 states
that time right so Arizona New Mexico

106
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,230
Oklahoma Hawaii and Alaska that's five
states offering their so basically ten

107
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,240
states didn't have compulsory education
now they didn't mean that hidden gota go

108
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,840
to school for longer than age 15
required to go to school it just meant

109
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,050
that there wasn't a law on the books
that said you had to go to school into a

110
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:13,180
certain age is fourteen I just had our
modern school system starting really

111
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,040
about 1910 they start to introduce in
this completely different way of

112
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,010
teaching students it's known as the
progressive era of school

113
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:29,610
the purpose of school switched it went
from teaching these scorer clashes these

114
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,310
classical training is what they called
it chew what was known as content

115
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,010
knowledge and other words we teach you
something you tell us what we talked you

116
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:45,470
and then learning how to live so giving
life skills about 66 percent of children

117
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,620
attended school yet compulsory education
pretty much all over the nation at that

118
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,170
time each time a new state would join
the union they would introduce her

119
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,610
enacted law for compulsory education

120
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,250
the problem was only about 50% of kids
actually went long enough to receive a

121
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,150
diploma

122
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,580
a lot of states at that time compulsory
education still ended up fourteen or

123
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,350
fifteen years old

124
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,770
and then this is I cut and pasted this
is the purpose of education or modern

125
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:20,010
education is to produce the managerial
and professional leadership needed for

126
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:26,280
rapid economic modernization what I did
not realize is industry and corporate

127
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:33,080
america had a huge impact on on the way
that we began to teach our students and

128
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,320
the purpose was raised give them the
skills so that they could go into the

129
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,000
workforce and grow their company are the
industry that they were part of

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,180
interestingly enough at this time trade
school so they also started doing a lot

131
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,980
of the trade system they hadn't England
you know since the beginning of time it

132
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,050
kind of faltered towards the late 1800's
in america where they brought that back

133
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,990
because they recognize they needed
skilled training are skilled tradesmen

134
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,090
to do particular task that it took you a
long time you know to gain the knowledge

135
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,800
skills and ability so I just thought
that was interesting you'll see this

136
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,260
statement again and our modern schooling
homeschooling is right out of my facts

137
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,600
wrong in my life said so it makes sense
once I started reading her sources to

138
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,390
begin with

139
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,040
going as a movement started in the
sixties after you think about it this

140
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,750
makes a lot of sense what was happening
in the sixties had some little fight

141
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,890
with another country right Vietnam War
right with that came along the hippie

142
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:47,510
movement what that time evangelical
Christian Sri like we stand for and they

143
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,920
started actually pulling their kids out
of school systems whether it was legal

144
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,020
or not legal at the time so that was
kind of where the movement started in

145
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,600
the eighties it really picked up and
other people started to understand that

146
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,210
these kids that are homeschooled they're
actually doing well and society a lot of

147
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,700
those missed that were being perpetuated
like your schools or how are your kids

148
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,420
won't be socialized right my kids
receive more socialization than kids in

149
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,260
high school high school elementary
school and middle school and its cuz we

150
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,990
have the ability to do a lot of other
activities where they meet

151
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,140
new people you're not socialized if you
sit next to the same person everyday you

152
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,800
become accustomed to that person that
doesn't help you when you meet a new

153
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,080
person right so nineteen eighties home
school is actually legal in about 50% of

154
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:44,870
the state's is actually 26 of the of the
states but I rounded and then in 1993

155
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,700
the first time that it became legal in
every state now will warn you that every

156
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,040
state is different and some are
drastically different one of the things

157
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,140
that I told to put in here and every
time I went through this presentation

158
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:05,390
was like oh I have to add that HSL da if
you know nothing else are you take

159
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:12,000
nothing else away from this presentation
look up Google HSL da they are the home

160
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,880
school Legal Defense Association they
are to homeschooling as eff is Chu

161
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,850
digital rights so they have lawyers on
staff have lawyers in every state that

162
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:30,110
every time I change comes and law they
will actually look at that and they will

163
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,839
defend you if your abiding by if you pay
your feet I think it's like $25 a year

164
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:41,510
I'm not sure my wife pays it I'm not
allowed to handle money

165
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,079
Dave Ramsey helped us you too can do it
but you just gotta take my cards away in

166
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:55,250
order to do it so cash 50 bucks now
don't ask me for anyone so yes so HSL da

167
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,459
look at it is a lifesaver they explain a
lot of different things

168
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:07,149
question so far alright so the first
thing that I outright told was this but

169
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:13,010
I did sources so these are kind of the
methodologies behind teaching and a lot

170
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,100
of these are integrated into
homeschooling the beautiful thing about

171
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,959
homeschooling is number one you don't
have to be a trained educator some of

172
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,770
the better homeschoolers I've met don't
have a degree they definitely don't have

173
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,880
an advanced degree can't say that I know
of one person

174
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:38,270
so but anyway I'll go over each one of
these so unit studies that is what the

175
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,930
approach that we takin my house so what
it is is you build your curriculum based

176
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,450
on a single topic and then everything
that you do supports that topic so once

177
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,840
you know once again I mentioned my first
or second side where Christian we

178
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,000
believe there is a God we believe
there's Jesus so everything that we

179
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,780
talked about whether it be science or
art or whatever it is that's always the

180
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,740
main thing right

181
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,130
it may not be the only thing it's not
but it will be a recurring theme

182
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,360
the other thing is all-in-one curricula
so this is a lot of times which you'll

183
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,710
you can buy from from different services
their homes going services out there

184
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:28,350
they put together wonderful packets and
you can literally say I don't wanna do

185
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,960
the research to figure out the text
books I want to buy all go with the

186
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,990
trusted source are all talk to a friend
and see what they use

187
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,810
we started out with the system called a
backup abacus a wonderful system then my

188
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,330
wife decided she didn't like the Mascus
mass not her strong suit and she didn't

189
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,780
like how they taught the math so we kept
a backup and then replace the math with

190
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,870
Massey she and then now she's to the
point where she selects each object for

191
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,630
each child because we've been doing this
for a while she's an educator by trade

192
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:05,690
she does have a degree and so that's
just how are natural progression lent a

193
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,040
lot of people just start off with the
all-in-one packages there's nothing

194
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,100
wrong with that right try it out

195
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,510
ask your kids how they thought it was my
kids had my wife hated the man she

196
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,270
thought they liked it yes sir

197
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:32,010
it exactly yeah so what he said because
I want to make sure that mixtape is if

198
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,330
you start with an all-in-one you're not
gonna break your kids right if they

199
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,390
learn something that's going to be
corrected just may not be there learning

200
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,460
style a lot of times

201
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:50,210
student pace learning this is really a
methodology it's kind of a mode but the

202
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,440
theory behind missus they drive their
own education so they will tell you slow

203
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,750
down or speed up right at the next one I
can't see my screen so online education

204
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:07,970
there are a lot of schools that are
actually accredited by their state

205
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,830
department of education that offer
online schools there's also a lot more

206
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:20,300
on accredited organization so keep that
in mind in kentucky which they have to

207
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,899
they're both I think a little but
they're actually accredited by the state

208
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:31,350
of Kentucky let's see Thomas learning
this is what I like to refer to as a

209
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:38,090
toad didactic that word wrong that's why
stop auto didactic this is so driven

210
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:44,430
learning so a lot of Montessori started
out with this this concept right you go

211
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:44,970
in

212
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,380
there's no there's like ideas of what
you should be doing that day but if a

213
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:56,640
child goes off shoe play with a toy then
the educator will integrate whatever

214
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,350
that topic is into what that child's
doing so it's pretty cool very time

215
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:08,310
intensive it requires a lot of training
I'm schooling this is basically wire it

216
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:14,930
is there is no plan kid wakes up they go
out they decided not to go outside and

217
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,460
play and then you as the educator decide
what it is that you're gonna try to

218
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,110
teach its all about teachable moments
right your child walks up to the

219
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,290
sidewalk they're about to cross the
street you stop on each arm but look

220
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:27,830
both ways

221
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,080
writes that kind of thing

222
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,159
and then we have obviously community
resources I was never a fan of the

223
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,200
library system I always thought it was
just a drain on tax taxpayers dollars

224
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,950
right now I heavily support the library
system in Fayette County because they do

225
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,190
a lot of really good programs throughout
the day mostly after school

226
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,360
weekends and they're wonderful they have
great book clubs that I mean there will

227
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:51,280
be the Oprah Winfrey book club any day
so many questions about these yes yes

228
00:19:51,280 --> 00:20:02,560
so every time I bring up the fact that I
hated public libraries somebody always

229
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,030
tells me one more nugget that just makes
them better so go to your public library

230
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:14,880
see what they have to offer you already
paying for hers another our next stop so

231
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,610
there is a shortage of stem science
technology engineering mathematics

232
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:25,460
talent for the number of stealing jobs
in the workforce fact or fiction is a

233
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:32,540
huge topic every magazine you pick up
talks about this I said undecided or

234
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:41,250
undetermined and here's the reason so
almost every article newspaper magazine

235
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,380
whatever it might be the new station
they get all their information from the

236
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,670
same source now I provided what they
source are provided the statement that

237
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:59,000
they get a lot of the reporting from now
let's and highs this there's some 40,000

238
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,390
Computer Science Bachelor Degree earners
each year but roughly 4 million job

239
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,140
vacancies for computer workers that is a
typical statement from the Department of

240
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,230
Labor and the Department of Education
here's the problem let's take a look at

241
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,890
what they said there's forty thousand
cops I bachelor honours ever hear how

242
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,640
many people in this room have a computer
science degree that's actually more than

243
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,310
normal

244
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:33,130
there's a lot so 40,000

245
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,730
an entire nation is not a lot how many
people in here that don't have Comp Sci

246
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:45,530
degrees are and I T RA computer related
field right of a business degree right

247
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:51,240
shoulder you look at the actual numbers
are small they don't account for people

248
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,580
that don't have degrees at all

249
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,740
how many people don't have a degree in
this room and you work in a computer

250
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,340
field we're not counted

251
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,510
well I have a degree so you're not
counted at all there's no specific

252
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,230
statistic that coverage you that I've
found and I've been researching this for

253
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:17,230
almost 12 months now so I can't find one
the other one is the definition of a

254
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,330
computer worker that's anyone that uses
a computer to complete their daily

255
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:30,360
activities it does not count cashiers so
I thought that was an interesting little

256
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:37,420
thing show anyone basically that uses a
computer daily say an office worker not

257
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,200
a 90% non-computer science person on an
engineer and architect they are

258
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,250
considered a computer worker what does
it matter that we only have forty

259
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:54,280
thousand still are this is just sorry
computer science degree earners out

260
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,510
there a year whatever we have other
people that can do the job search start

261
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,530
to read into some of the statements the
public statements are being made I guess

262
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:07,880
I'd this statement has been sourced
several times and several articles and

263
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:15,360
it's actually a little disconcerting for
me yes yes that's actually in the report

264
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,140
to Congress matter fact one of the best
videos I've ever seen in my life was

265
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,360
micros testify testifying before
Congress where he's talking about our

266
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,300
skilled labor force are as he put it the
unskilled labor force so it's the best I

267
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,960
think it's seven minutes but you can
watch he directly talks about this about

268
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:42,340
how it doesn't matter how many people we
have that have college degrees if we

269
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,390
can't build a building because we don't
have a skilled laborers to swing a

270
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:53,130
hammer write something my wife brings up
all the time is you can make the best

271
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,170
product in the world but if you don't
have an artist to sell it or did draw

272
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,909
that marketing brochure you're not gonna
sell it

273
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:13,989
so we need our liberal arts majors right
that's i mean he said we need them

274
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:17,729
always liked him cuz I think different
they're weird now we're landing Aaron

275
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:25,989
are thought a lot of times but ok so
let's talk about stem so time check ok

276
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:32,039
so science technology engineering and
math if you actually don't chew the

277
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,869
Department of Education website which I
have sourced at the end of this they've

278
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:39,349
actually broken that out it's the
acronym now is this long

279
00:24:39,349 --> 00:25:04,940
yes ma'am yes so cool understand that
and they're putting steam cracker down

280
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,220
so they're adding arts back into it

281
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,580
yeah so that's a plug for Rocky bridge

282
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:22,130
branch sorry rocky branch are excellent
point thank you for bringing the steam

283
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:28,680
steam now you got me saying steam still
actually it's a beautiful thing actually

284
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,760
started in the nineteen nineties it
actually they the Department of our I'm

285
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,370
sorry the National Science Foundation
formulated the finished product in 1997

286
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:46,350
and actually start of the University of
Massachusetts they gave them a large sum

287
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:51,390
of money and said can you actually take
this program and put it into practice

288
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:56,990
and they said probably not but what we
can do is teach the teachers that would

289
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,380
put this program and practice so I was
an excellent way to start they actually

290
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,940
kinda like Steam added their own bitch
the acronym and they said it's science

291
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,610
technology engineering and math teacher
education collaborative they understood

292
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:18,650
no amount of money could replicate this
all over the country without teaching

293
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:26,210
the teachers here's another disturbing
point that I discovered this bottom

294
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:34,610
bottom line was actually I copied
impatient this from the stem tak

295
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:40,520
documentation given to him by NSF have
we seen that before that's the same

296
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,840
exact statement that started this whole
modern era of schooling right so the

297
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,860
purpose of the stem program is the same
purposes 1910 whenever the government

298
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:57,820
said we need to cater our educational
system to our industry and corporate

299
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,800
america so it's still not about
necessarily thinking across all

300
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,510
verticals if you will

301
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,190
it's still about learning something
specific so that you can help corporate

302
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:18,830
America or the industry base I'm all
about 33 thinking I wasn't that way so

303
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,610
we started homeschooling I'm always made
me understand

304
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:27,240
driving forces behind this here's some
statistics I won't get into all of them

305
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,330
cuz honestly most of them don't make
sense so eighty-one percent of

306
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,270
asian-americans and 71 percent of
Caucasians attended schools that offer

307
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:43,380
the full range of stem what does that
matter right to say eighty-one percent

308
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,130
of asian-americans attended the schools
that doesn't mean that they're taking

309
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:51,059
the classes means I attended the schools
right you can still select what classes

310
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:56,179
you take it's based on your state that
determines what classes are the minimum

311
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:01,210
standards I only took two years of math
in high school all taxes required me to

312
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,820
take and I would have taken 0 if they
would not required it would probably

313
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:13,700
filled with PE or something which I
guess so but this is the full full range

314
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,350
I was lucky my high school offered each
one of these classes actually had an

315
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:23,470
Honors Program and it's one of the
classes too I was a none of them and

316
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,780
then they came out and said other
minorities are drastically worse they

317
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:33,000
did not have any statistics that they
would support that there was no number

318
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,140
broken down by any other race or or
origin it was just Asian American and

319
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,660
Caucasian and the other was the other
one so I think it's important that they

320
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:49,100
go back and do that study right i mean
if you're going to use statistics you

321
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,750
have to use statistics for everything
she can compare the numbers are

322
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:59,669
drastically worse if it's 82 percent
according to government or I guess that

323
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:04,980
would be the opposite of its 80% it's
not drastic right we have no perspective

324
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:11,760
what the numbers they've given us no
doubt that it's bad but I've been in a

325
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,950
lot of inner-city schools that offer
very few math even for state

326
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,830
requirements they don't meet the
statement of them sometimes that's why

327
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,080
sometimes state's takeover schools
because they can't meet the minimums

328
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,559
16 percent of high school students are
competent mass that's based on annual

329
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,250
competency exams and then
internationally ranked 29th in math and

330
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:40,390
22nd science yet we still lead the world
in industry in innovation I don't see

331
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,440
that as a problem yet it may be a
problem in the future I'm not a forward

332
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,230
thinker I don't think ten years in the
future right and it's not me so our next

333
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,070
break

334
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:56,309
logic and reasoning is formally taught
in less than two percent of schools if

335
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:01,059
it isn't sure it feels true I couldn't
find any statistics whatsoever about the

336
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,250
teaching of logic or reasoning skills
and once again

337
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,880
logic and reasoning is that it's the
bridge between all subjects it doesn't

338
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,360
really matter if you can specialize in
one subject if you can't write your

339
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,210
ideas down on a piece of paper or convey
them to someone else it's not a good

340
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,080
thing

341
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:26,090
ok psychology who cares psychology isn't
a part of stem so we're not even discuss

342
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:32,559
it there's no state emphasis on the
Liberal Arts in any state it's usually

343
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,000
the number-one programs cut from schools
are and this is really sad they say we

344
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,649
have an obesity problem and children but
PE is always the first to go and

345
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:46,779
elementary school and then art and art
related programs and high schooler

346
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:51,159
usually the first thing to go starting
with ban how many people took banned

347
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:57,669
this blew my mind a lot of people to ban
disband her does music have anything to

348
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:03,460
do with mathematics absolutely so I know
what those lines are little symbols

349
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,080
right but immediately my wife was like
that's a quarter note I like heard that

350
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,750
before

351
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:17,399
color another note trade and it's how
many times you be in whenever she

352
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:24,120
teaches math or she did one of our kids
were little she would be on a desk 1234

353
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:31,809
helps and counting it starts making
another spin option your brain fire to

354
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:34,160
put two things together instead of just
saying

355
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,070
that's for things I gotta figure it out
right I take one away I have one to

356
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,290
three right

357
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:46,840
started sounding out really did wonders
and our kids math progression once again

358
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,750
no emphasis on sales marketing any other
soft skill where people were about soft

359
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,180
skills even know where all the lot of us
are ITN don't like to hear that right

360
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:01,460
one of the person behind locked doors so
now from this point on I'm gonna start

361
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:07,200
talking about some of the things that we
incorporated into our school academy and

362
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,230
I will start with these are Kentucky
state requirements so if you want to

363
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,670
open up a home school according to open
a homeschool but your home school your

364
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,760
children according to the state of
Kentucky these your requirements now I

365
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,920
find this absolutely hilarious
Department of Education has set of

366
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,950
requirements has anybody been on the
governor's web page for homeschooling he

367
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:35,550
actually has letters demanding the
requirements so what he will say is

368
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,660
there there are things that are better
reared says like you have to be

369
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:45,100
available for inspection of your
curricula material actually says that in

370
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,770
the law

371
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,510
you know the governor says whenever they
come to your door handle this letter

372
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:54,210
that says you require to direct all
communications to my lawyer you don't

373
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:58,000
need a lawyer but they will never come
back I guarantee it and I know that

374
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,300
kazan HSL da on their website they are
the lawyer of record for most of these

375
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,230
cases in there never contacted so
there's some crazy things that can

376
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,080
happen

377
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,070
HSL da 25 bucks recommend anyway so you
have to notify your superintendent in

378
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,760
writing within 10 days of the beginning
of the school year you have to establish

379
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:25,040
a homeschool on paper with a woman you
have to enroll your children your

380
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,390
actually slept have a physical
enrollment form that our children right

381
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,820
name age security number of those kind
of things you have to record and

382
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,290
maintain scholarship reports that's
great

383
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:42,790
a sign reads you have to keep attendance
directors you must have 1062 hours and

384
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:48,580
270 days of instruction is fighting all
my neighbor kids were angry because we

385
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,500
had like 500 school days last snow days
last year nobody went to school

386
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:00,590
my kids are out by the summer though
this isn't fair you have to decide on

387
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,850
the curriculum they don't see how you do
that you just decide on a curriculum and

388
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:13,720
then you have to teach core instructions
in English I never knew that ok so this

389
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,000
is how we went through our curriculum
and instruction we determined we were

390
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,710
gonna do unit studies which has multiple
subjects to teach one topic like I said

391
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,380
we're christians so our underlying topic
has gotten everything we do from science

392
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:32,950
to our folks back into that we almost
went with the all-in-one by buying

393
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:38,010
packages here we need all 11 but then my
wife said I think I can do better and

394
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:43,310
she did and then we toyed with the idea
of online but we didn't we didn't go

395
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,140
with online we wanted to instruct her
kids forgot to pull him out of school we

396
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:51,250
wanted to be the ones to teach them
right kind of made logical sense force

397
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:57,820
until high school I'll get to that in a
second so here's the modes that we went

398
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,790
through we dabbled with online we're
definitely parent led now that my

399
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:08,580
daughter is in high school she's a 10th
grader we decided that we wanted her to

400
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,040
start preparing for college by
interacting with other students more

401
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,280
heavily so she already interacted with
students with some of the projects that

402
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,740
we did that i'm gonna explain but we
wanted a little bit more focused

403
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,860
attention and then dual enrollment
starting next year I'll of Kentucky

404
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,610
about this dual enrollment thing all
that's required for your child to go to

405
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:35,690
college as a statement from your
guidance counselor that's me on that

406
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:41,430
says your child is responsible enough
and has the aptitude to take college

407
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,910
classes and then you can go to community
college

408
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,340
wonderful yes

409
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:57,260
yes you can

410
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,930
your kids after you do the instruction
you can have them to CLEP test they get

411
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:07,080
college credits for that they can take
AP exams so yeah there's a lot of

412
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,700
opportunities the game college credit
right and a CLEP exam across a hundred

413
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,880
bucks will save you several hundred
dollars in college fees but I'm really

414
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,210
pushing heavily on my daughter right now
I recommend having a lesson plan this is

415
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,550
the one I started out with my wife never
ceases video shows makes fun of me

416
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:33,070
because like she does a stuffed her head
she was an educator for years and I have

417
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,230
to write it all down I can't remember
from one day to the next what my goal

418
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,360
was right but I'll show you what I do
now now that we've been doing it for 10

419
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,920
years

420
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:54,650
yeah this is publicly available I think
it's from yeah there you go

421
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,380
lesson plans for teachers at the bottom
and this is just one of their several

422
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:06,680
ones one of the show ya one of many her
some examples Pinewood Derby I'm having

423
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,690
income scales love Cub Scouting right my
son is excited about it one of the few

424
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:18,930
things he gets excited about weekly show
instead of just building a car and

425
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:23,790
honestly in Cub Scouts my parents but of
course my son Bill his cars he told us

426
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,380
but instead of just you know given him
some tools and set them free in the

427
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,920
garage when every seven I walked into
the process and here was our process i

428
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,500
SAT my goal I want to introduce him to
told he had never used his beat the

429
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,170
crowd out of nails with a hammer before
but I wanted to teach them about sauce

430
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,680
and safety and I wanted to be there with
them while we did it together and

431
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,190
actually ended up doing in the living
room which my wife was a happy about but

432
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,570
we'll get to that later and then the
ultimate goal was to build a race car

433
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,540
what is done look like that that's
something a lot of people struggle with

434
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,480
you don't teach in my opinion just to
teach you teach so that you can have a

435
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,040
conclusion and point to your child and
say we did these steps here's the

436
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,550
results have some fun with it right a
lot of people feel that they have to

437
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,470
teach because their daily plans says
they have to teach that's not the

438
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:21,050
purpose of education so this is the plan
that we went there before we even touch

439
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,930
the would move on out on the internet we
found a lot of really good sources she

440
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:30,900
would be surprised at the number of like
physics and engineering people that

441
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:38,550
model pinewood derby cars and then this
is crazy we got to win test the car that

442
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,860
he picked up with the statistical model
from some guys website and like USC or

443
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:49,220
something like that UCLA it was great
that like 400 versions of cars and we

444
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:55,010
did it we learned about friction that's
very important whenever you have a

445
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:01,290
unpowered gravity powered car as
friction right how do you reduce drag we

446
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:07,640
built the car and then we raced the car
so here's the end result of bossa would

447
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,570
she ever felt by so it's really the
whole block as Alex's we went on the

448
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,780
internet we test all these different
designs he didn't want to go for speedy

449
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,100
wanted to go with what you thought was
cool I was ok with that his car so we

450
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:29,100
came up with this very aerodynamic are
the only thing I get on this whole thing

451
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:35,470
was I did the same thing because I love
my son I think he did a great job but i

452
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:39,210
wasnt car so I i say he did it right

453
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:44,630
yeah he did all the cutting himself he
did all the designer himself and you

454
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,570
know 23rd place now in his den there are
only five people but we didn't you know

455
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,640
we didn't talk about that right so one
will fall off so that guy was a man you

456
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,200
know he couldn't even repair it sorry
kid you know you did a good job though

457
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:05,240
good job so yes so that is what we do
with homeschooling now my older daughter

458
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,270
some of you have heard some of this
before because

459
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:14,770
she was sheer doing this presentation
was here last year jeff was my daughter

460
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:23,680
last year she was talking about going to
Africa and this is what we did so I

461
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,540
wanted to teach she said that I want to
be an artist she thought to be a

462
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:34,750
photographer as I can I know nothing
about art you know that statement you

463
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,040
know our because it's what you
appreciate are you know are when you see

464
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:45,880
it I don't know art right buildings like
oh wow its cement congratulations you

465
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,370
made it stand up that start to me and
she wanted to provide access basically

466
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:59,500
the HSE model here to children in Kenya
to receive the same level of education

467
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:05,140
she's getting it already helps that my
mother-in-law has a mission that she

468
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,520
goes over every six months to Kenya and
we have adopted a clinic and a school

469
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:18,700
she wanted to provide education to the
school is done looks like we wanted a

470
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,830
working Rachel pie and whenever you go
over to the HFC booth they have it all

471
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,300
the way over to the left hand side it's
just a little Raspberry Pi with wireless

472
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,440
dongle plugged into it and software
right that's all we were looking for the

473
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,180
first year she was 13 she was computer
user that was it

474
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:44,240
so my plan to teach about the Raspberry
Pi because it was a self-contained

475
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:51,280
computer 25 bucks I think it is 35
remember I'm gonna build an XBMC sure

476
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,420
her and the reason for that is if you
know anything about XBMC it basically is

477
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,110
already there you just have to download
it correctly install it on the sdcard

478
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,880
plug it in

479
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,890
hook it up to a TV done right so it's a
good baby stuff I wanted to gain an

480
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,390
appreciation for Windows which after a
show you one of the pictures here you

481
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,380
understand that she now has the same

482
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,180
credi appreciation of Windows the rest
of us probably do I made her do a fresh

483
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,750
install on everything even though the
computers I gained an appreciation of

484
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:29,190
Linux because i dont have an
appreciation of Linux I hate Linux but I

485
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,119
made her do everything command line she
now understands Linux command line she

486
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,660
won't use it and I don't blame her and
I'm not going to make her but I wanted

487
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:42,650
to understand what goes on behind the
scenes how does the software hardware to

488
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:48,299
make the light blinker whatever build
and deploy Rachel high and then this one

489
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:52,519
was hurt she said i wanna talk at one of
these conferences and I said I want to

490
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:56,500
move on and I've never been able to get
a ticket so maybe if I ride the

491
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,690
coattails of my daughter now give us a
ticket so she was selected to go to

492
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,220
smoke on and I went up there like a
champion I was onstage what they're

493
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:11,049
running long came up it was great and
then she taught at the car did a topic

494
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:16,289
at Appalachian shoot for digital
evidence Circle City con she's been in

495
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:21,920
Nashville at bsides Nashville this is
actually led to her she is now this

496
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,170
semester taken the public speaking
course so that's one of the emphasis

497
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,940
that she's learned is gonna be a better
public speaker to get out of this

498
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,720
practice but if i dont have the
foundation I'm never going to get better

499
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:40,589
so I was like whoo hoo when for that so
this is the first thing she did on her

500
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:46,880
own she went out and found this program
called Lego cat has anybody heard a Lego

501
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,670
cat so AutoCAD drawing an engineering
program right to make designs she found

502
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,720
Lego CAD which you do is import a
picture in the Lego cat and it will tell

503
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,390
you a part you need to build that
picture it is cool so this is my

504
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:09,070
Raspberry Pi case she felt herself
against her in a little brother

505
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:15,910
so from there she built the Rachel pie
so I made her go out and get the car to

506
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:24,440
the development site hold down the the
OS installed and tested I was going the

507
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,640
cheaper out something and it's a mission
trip we gotta save money right I bought

508
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,020
the wrong wifi dongle someone every
plugged in it didn't have the drivers

509
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,310
already loaded so I made her go out and
get the drivers and load them she did

510
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:45,970
not appreciate that but she appreciates
Linux this is heard about our eight

511
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:51,650
doing fresh install on Windows after
hitting yes to everything right and then

512
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,480
I said hey really good job now we got to
secure these devices is Johnny online

513
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,270
tell you any computer and Africa will
end up with a virus or malware within

514
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:07,060
the first day you turn it on so we went
through use she can't believe I did this

515
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,430
sometimes I look back and I'm like man
I'm a horrible father so I made her pick

516
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,110
out either the CIS standard the NSA
standard or the deal just a standard and

517
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:23,260
then go through the bike all two hundred
and fifty pages and security and 50 you

518
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,500
know I remember my horror stories of
doing that myself and I was like stop

519
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,900
we're gonna go to Microsoft and see what
they have to say and then we would use

520
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:37,290
Microsoft so yeah that's why she had
that look on her face as she hated me at

521
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,560
that point this was kind of the finished
product

522
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,250
what you don't see as the other laptops
under their think we ended up taking for

523
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:50,540
laptops on this trip once again she knew
she had a lot of problems with wifi so

524
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:57,840
her thing was what can we do if this
wifi thing messes up thanks and so I was

525
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,160
like I don't know what would you do if
she does maybe we need some kind of

526
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,090
physical thing so that's why she got the
cat5 cable and of course about cat5

527
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:10,350
cable cable on a small and connectors
and she had to make it

528
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:16,510
yeah so she did go to Africa and this is
her testing out before she turned it

529
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:22,680
over and Shiite by the way it was her
and my wife my wife and barely turn on a

530
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,960
computer so my daughter was completely
alone during this whole Africa trip

531
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,990
teaching the locals so this is her
teaching some of the locals is my

532
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:38,680
favorite people Salloum a wonderful lady
she actually supports an orphanage a

533
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,450
community school and then the the masai
tribal schools that we we support so we

534
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:50,390
talked her so that she could teach them
here's another project will so she left

535
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,000
in 2014

536
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,160
so I had the other two kids right now is
like our mom's not here so I guess dads

537
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,660
teaching you are going to talk about
we're going to talk about what radio

538
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:05,060
wave propagation and we're going to get
rid of cable will actually we had

539
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:10,140
satellite TV at the time I'm tired of
paying $180 a month show this is my

540
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:16,860
daughter and my shine after they had
googled HDD and tennis they had selected

541
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:22,310
this box and turn it down here I made
them ensure that we already had all the

542
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,630
parts I didn't wanna buy anything so
they had to go through all these

543
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:30,960
different websites and all these
different you know models of antennas

544
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,490
and this is the one that they selected
and we turned our TV I made them walk

545
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:39,760
around the house to each of the TV and
see where the best placement was course

546
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,740
keeping a nice little list of where they
were and so now we don't have satellite

547
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:52,930
TV and completely cut the court last one
African 2015 when her daughter came back

548
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:57,110
from Africa she said I really loved what
I did over there I really want to be an

549
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:04,480
artist what we need to do is build on
what we do so luckily at Shahrukh Khan

550
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,520
whenever she was given her presentation
johnnie long after the last five minute

551
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:14,450
what he did was bring us two of his
ruggedized Pelican posh with the

552
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:19,750
stipulation that she finished them they
were in boxes so this is my daughter

553
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,420
working with Sam kit

554
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,549
each about four o'clock in the morning
shot during which I really don't

555
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:28,190
recommend for the kids by the way they
should saw during the day whenever

556
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:35,040
they're fresh when she learned a lot
right and then we deployed that we

557
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,569
talked about it besides Nashville thanks
Jeff

558
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:43,170
love you at this is her so she still
want to be a photographer but this is

559
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:48,230
her first two books deep books that
she's actually gotten Georgia we'd mins

560
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:51,940
pen testing book we started going
through that and then the other one is

561
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:56,910
black python which looked at laughed and
put it on the shelf

562
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:00,700
like if you can't do it I'm not gonna
try it I was like wrong attitude but I

563
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,359
won't make you and then whenever you
into Africa we actually were able to do

564
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,569
two things went to Uganda first help
support johnnie setting up a hackerspace

565
00:49:09,569 --> 00:49:17,549
and these are each of my children
teaching robotics and electronics my

566
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:20,790
nine year old is one of the people
teaching he would not have been able to

567
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:25,420
do that had we not home schooled right
he would've been sitting in the corner

568
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,079
probably playing on his iPad but because
he had enough skills this foundational

569
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,730
skills and logic

570
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:38,829
you know as a nine year old to train so
johnnie said let me try we'll see what

571
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:45,680
we can do a really good job so many
questions

572
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:53,070
yes sir

573
00:49:53,070 --> 00:50:09,060
yeah so the question is if her home
schooling how do you do a special needs

574
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:09,920
issues

575
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,620
excellent question each one of my kids
has special needs so yes you have a

576
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:40,040
special need ok that's a good question

577
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:46,050
show what we do is show my shine
whenever we adopted him a cleft lip

578
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:52,000
cleft palate that resulted in ya show
he's he couldn't hear from like the

579
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,710
first three years of his life so now as
speaking and reading issues in order to

580
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:03,470
read it helps if you can hear so we
actually rely on the local school system

581
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:11,100
you cannot be barred from using this no
state arouses you cannot be barred from

582
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:16,060
using local school system to address
special needs because you are a taxpayer

583
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:20,400
you are guaranteed that right now what
they will do is make you fill out every

584
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,920
piece of paper that you did not fill out
because your kid wasn't in public school

585
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,120
so be prepared for that

586
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,180
yes

587
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:39,200
yes so

588
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:48,710
conventions maybe five the one for this
areas and Cincinnati on the east coast

589
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:56,550
of New South Carolina Dallas area and
somewhere in California they have

590
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,589
experts said whenever I come back from
one of these conferences and I'm like

591
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:03,680
yeah you know I had dinner with johnnie
long it was great and she's like who she

592
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,579
went to this one in cincinnati she's
like Mike Smith who should like he read

593
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:15,530
our text books for you know history and
should like now I got a text book as

594
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:21,770
autographed and now I know how she feels
whatever I get home from a conference so

595
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:27,369
yeah specialties are an issue but rely
on your state I'm lucky I'm a military

596
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:33,010
retiree show because you guys pay really
good taxes I get really good health care

597
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:37,410
so what the schools don't pick up

598
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:41,799
TRICARE will pick up for me it's great

599
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:48,799
