1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,589
thank you guys for coming back home pick
it up and told they get your timing I'm

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:11,250
Kevin bomb that's right we have to pitch
down here are our screen is a little

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:19,699
messed up against remember they can I do
I T hacking stuff also founded the many

4
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:23,570
poner pentas Dropbox project

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:29,529
hello everybody my name is Michael view
I'm manchester's well with the kitchen

6
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:34,300
for 3 laps I do a lot of hardware
hacking on the side and it was gracious

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,809
enough to hand over the project to
myself so I'm currently the maintainer

8
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:44,719
of that project a little bit but we both
worked for three labs for us to labs

9
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,260
division of security is a big accounting
firm we have for sale ads to penetration

10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,710
testing on its all that fun stuff like a
lot of you guys here if somebody's

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,370
looking to get into that we are hiring
all the time entry-level and experienced

12
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,230
auditors and testers whatever so
shameless plug because they paid for us

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,729
to be here right so what are we talking
about today it's 500 hacking projects

14
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:13,000
but yet you actually get six so phone us
a little bit about frugal hardware

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,310
hacking so true hardware hacking you
know I think barrier to entry for

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,250
hardware hacking is I'm afraid I'm going
to break stuff and it's hard and I don't

17
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,280
want to spend money that's definitely
how I was I did screw up alot alot of

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,530
things and in that kind of stuff but you
can do it on the cheap

19
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,659
can be a little creative do it on the
cheap but it's not hard

20
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:42,770
basic tools if you can afford and want
good tools definitely get good tool

21
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,350
you get a fluke multimeter if if if
you're trying to do either cheap benefit

22
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,299
if expensive tools are holding back the
cheap tools work pretty good too many

23
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,140
people out from the harbor freight tools
like how could it's awesome

24
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,179
$6 for the multimeter get the coupon
from their fire it's like three or

25
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:03,950
something like that you know and and a
nice too because I do a lot of stupid

26
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,079
things like not having the right setting
up my multimeter before and testing on

27
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,340
twenty books so I felt a multimeter
every once in a while so let's get the

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,459
cheap multimeters wire cutters it's nice
to get a nice soldering iron but again

29
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,000
you know a cheap one works too so that's
one of the big places to kind of start

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,349
your frugal hardware hacking and then
the other I i i buy a lot of cheap junk

31
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:31,230
from overseas to good places let's not
junk heap awesome stuff from overseas

32
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,560
literally you buy some of the stuff you
know so here's here's the Arduino nano

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,120
$1 82 I can't think of anyplace I could
get it shipped in these states $1 ready

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,170
to get started with free shipping from
China so the two good places even a few

35
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,739
been on Aliexpress like the Chinese
version of Amazon but it's just insane

36
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:56,920
but you can buy their so get hardly
knows a logic analyzer will demo one of

37
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,480
those you know knock off of the sea life
you are in the router hacking talk he

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,299
talked about the sea logic logic
analyzer is cheap knockoff of that i TTL

39
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,510
adapter is a nice thing to have its just
a serial adapter for talking two routers

40
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,760
things like that but then buy other
stuff to help you out you know you can

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,440
get bundles a jumper wires for $0.99
resistors and capacitors is crazy so

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,950
this is $5 here for a thousand
capacitors like 50 little individual

43
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,400
ziplock bags someone is handwritten on
every bag what the value the pastor is

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,169
five bucks like again when are they
paying these people I don't know I feel

45
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,739
bad buying it but hopefully they're
getting paid for it so better than

46
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:48,090
nothing and pro-aborts as well so yeah
you know i buy stuff that I think I'm

47
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,180
gonna use a month from now because it
takes a little while Japan China but you

48
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,759
can find it stuff in the mail from China
all times every couple days like the new

49
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,970
toy to play with

50
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:02,550
so that's that's that's just you know
you can do it for Glee not that bad and

51
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,500
so all the projects we talked about
today are are are under that round it's

52
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,900
like you know let's let's find something
expensive and let's hack it and see if

53
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,330
we can do it and if it screws up doesn't
work we're not out that much money and

54
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,530
we learned something so the first one
the RFID bad Snooper I did a talk

55
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,480
similar to this just this project a
couple years ago here but there's a

56
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,040
little bit better ban said that cuz I
figured out since then how to get it to

57
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,090
do the proxy mark the head cards if
you're not gonna head cards thats they

58
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,130
look like the proxy card 20 whatever
really comment proximity card badge type

59
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,920
type type system works on 25 kilohertz
and you can buy up rocks market

60
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,020
$300 or something like that little sniff
the card and playback the car for two

61
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,050
suit so he can do that much more cheaply
in the first half of that is stiffen the

62
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,900
carts in the car where to go faster got
a lot of flights were gonna have these

63
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,560
slides onto me Porter dot com website
will have that up here too so don't feel

64
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,020
like here I'm going too fast so I have
to so we're gonna take a cheap cheap

65
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:19,240
RFID lack like this and that was built
for like it's not built for the hit cars

66
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,400
built for these little token Sarah in
402 simpler protocol but it turns out

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,270
that the circuitry they build into those
decodes the signal in a way that you can

68
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,400
get the head card credit card with it as
well

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,090
Michael can pass that around and we're
gonna do that as we just can't find a

70
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,409
couple certain

71
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:44,429
well I'm gonna hate myself so to do this
project you need one of these locks it

72
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:49,349
was $10 two years ago it's probably even
cheaper now you need an Arduino nano

73
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,129
there are 350 two years ago

74
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:56,019
slide but its entirety to from China the
logic analyzers I know they're cheaper

75
00:05:56,019 --> 00:06:01,589
than that now to its insane

76
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:07,379
need a couple jumper wires and there's
this one can you do need to connect the

77
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:12,899
board and UDC adapter power that locks
getting passed around and and the

78
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,829
biggest kind of most challenging thing
with this project is to find that the

79
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:19,419
modulated signal so there's there's a
pin on that there's there's a signal on

80
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:23,669
that board somewhere that's coming from
the antenna got partially decoded and

81
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:27,379
it's going to the chip there's a chip on
their that's that's processing it will

82
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:31,129
use up tap into that signal and read
with Arduino as well

83
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:36,319
couple ways to find it weird thing is
those boards for these locks every time

84
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,749
our time I get a different design
cheaper to redesign the board because

85
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:44,839
they can get cheaper components I got
like five different versions of it every

86
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,339
time our order small batch of the ones I
have a project I website they'll be

87
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,769
pictures showing where I found you know
the single pin on this one was the

88
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:56,819
fourth one down on the bottom of the
board and there was a place to do around

89
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,709
here is another version where they
actually had a list of headers and you

90
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:06,409
know there is called to this project you
not only do the RFID like there's a

91
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:11,029
memory chip there that that holds the
key codes for badges that are in there

92
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,529
and so you can actually use these other
pins here to read and write that memory

93
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:18,869
chip printer set those signals a really
cool like she packing platform just play

94
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:25,399
with blocks as well but this is where
logic analyzer can come in handy I'm

95
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,780
gonna show you real comeback

96
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:37,200
so I've hooked his logic analyzer up to
the board I can do I can use my computer

97
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:45,100
one-handed so this is that logic
analyzer it sucked up to that pin that I

98
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,550
was talking about we had to find the
right pin and and we actually used that

99
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,840
logic is only one way to find it you'll
find a different areas have different

100
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,530
signals and if I look at this pen you
know it looks like it's just got us

101
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,940
standing square wave and actually see
its 225 kilohertz where wave which has

102
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,950
no time 25 killer protocol so we think
we're close if I throw this hid prox

103
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:18,680
card on it and do the same capture and
don't jiggle around things it looks

104
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,900
about the same but I'm actually zooming
its 925 kilohertz anymore and it's not

105
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,580
an even squarewave anymore if you look
really close its like compressed and

106
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,580
stretched and compressed and stretched
that's one of the modulations that this

107
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,610
vid card uses its frequency shift keying
and so like a compressed set of waves is

108
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,589
a 10 and a bandit has one or maybe the
opposite so we're actually seeing the

109
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,130
signal that's the number on this card
this card is not smart it's done any

110
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,880
time it gets into 125 killer its RFID
feel it just starts spitting out its

111
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,600
number using this modulation so so the
first step and you really need to do

112
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,000
this step it's kind of fun to do get the
logic analyzer spend a few bucks and

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,800
just you know play with it but I needed
to build the

114
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,529
the project here because the next step
is we found that signal now we're just

115
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:14,339
gonna hook an Arduino onto instead and
the Arduino has some nifty features like

116
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,070
interrupts and timers so we can actually
use those features and bill basically a

117
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,589
stopwatch that's that's measuring the
length of each of those different

118
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:29,800
signals so if I know I meant started
when I stopped when the singing go slow

119
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,529
and find the microseconds through that
and measure that and used to do some fun

120
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:40,230
math and you end up getting a card
number so I've got the pro I will have

121
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,250
on the drive home only post in this
stuff out here if it's not there already

122
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:55,230
but I'll show you it in action so here's
just the third car down there so I'm

123
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,630
already doing it so so this card says
its number 246 there are some key points

124
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,190
the use of the numbers longer so if I
put it on there gonna start to say I'm

125
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:10,610
seeing card number to 46 this one says
271 same card number 271 so the binary

126
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,810
you see there is the actual signal that
the card is sending out and then the 271

127
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,230
as the master Dakota so after 10 bucks
well 12 bucks if you go 10 bucks for the

128
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:25,300
the bad the card reader and another two
bucks for the Nano you've got half of a

129
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,950
próxima which is really hit card if you
get close enough to the reader so that

130
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,220
is the first project

131
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:46,339
question have I worked on shrinking it
down from the flock size so I i hesitate

132
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:53,240
to say I have this awesome idea and I'm
so freakin close so these these bad

133
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,520
readers like Lake it has to power the
card and get the signal and all that but

134
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:06,180
if you put another small coil next to
this this reader and then put your car

135
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,990
between it that coil get the same signal
as the big coil in the card reader but

136
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,059
it's much weaker but the exact same
signal

137
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,879
and I'm sure I'm positive you could
build a device that's probably about

138
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,699
this big that you could stick onto the
site of one of those who card readers

139
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:29,819
and just have a kind of vampire tap off
those signals when people are reading I

140
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:33,359
just haven't been able to build a clean
enough circuit to catch it caused the

141
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:38,169
signal is so weak so if anybody is is
awesome about that P you could shrink it

142
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:44,149
down that way but for this part of it
like being able to bring a car near read

143
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:48,179
it you kinda need the big antenna you
need to have a big enough car I feel the

144
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:53,109
power this card for it to modulate the
signal

145
00:11:53,109 --> 00:12:05,199
questions on that first project gonna
take a hit reader outside option yeah

146
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:12,769
yeah yeah so one of things like actually
have one so this is my my black version

147
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:15,769
which was high the Arduino and some
batteries and stuff inside of it and

148
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,429
have a just log it and stick it next to
the existing when can people going big

149
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:22,509
office buildings you there's two or
three of these anyway like you know

150
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:32,849
maybe the scan their badge on mine so
alright so that's this new person that

151
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:37,049
gets the number of the card now if we do
it so the speaker is kind of cool to

152
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:44,769
rebuild one of these and and you don't
need to many components for it you need

153
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,419
an antenna and were actually use the
antenna is an existing key the case when

154
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,039
you buy these lacks an exact came with
ten keys for 10 bucks to get to lock in

155
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:57,019
10 keys are you can use one of the keys
the antenna for this project but that's

156
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,919
only three components as well as the
Arduino to build this this this this

157
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:07,369
before part and I'll show you why that
is so I i've manufactured a few PCBs if

158
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:12,599
you go to the many pointer website will
have the the board the templates you

159
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:16,489
could at shareowner manufacturer on but
it's only three components you know you

160
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:19,759
can do it I'm proud aboard you can get
together however works for you or even

161
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:27,629
do it in a solderless breadboard
something like that so first up is to

162
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:32,699
turn the key 5 into the antenna the key
fob has the coil the antenna that we

163
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:36,389
want but also has its own circuitry
inside of it already that it's gonna

164
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:40,379
give its own signal so we just need to
destroy that circuitry I found it works

165
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,639
best kind of drill through a little
drill or maybe cut it with a knife but

166
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,959
you just need to break that little black
bow blob there is the circuitry to break

167
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,559
that it stops working

168
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,569
the other thing is it's really hard to
solder out of those really fine wires so

169
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:58,259
you're much better soldering onto the
the two little solder points there that

170
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,079
their circuit reason so once you cut
their circuit you've got some extra

171
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:05,949
points for yourself to be a don't try to
move the antenna exclude in the wire to

172
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:11,739
cell phone use wreck everything so
there's a picture we have included are

173
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:16,929
drilled through it and then you know you
can't see once I have little leads on to

174
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:22,279
it and if you've done it right you can
use a multi tester and just test the

175
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:27,469
resistance the continuity through that
coil and it won't be zero because

176
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:30,699
there's so much why are there you get
about 200 200 homes that means you did

177
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:37,459
it right now is me doing that said the
circuit is really simple the way the

178
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:43,049
circuit works is that D nine on the
Arduino the data pin is giving that

179
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,669
signal that you saw kind of it needs to
turn on or turn off to give the 1010

180
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:53,509
signal and this little circuit over here
with the capacity of the adductor if you

181
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:56,739
put a capacitor and inductor inductors
just a coil where you put the two of

182
00:14:56,739 --> 00:15:01,649
those together you get a circuit that
resonates and we're choosing a capacitor

183
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:05,659
that works with one of these keys to
make it resonate are 25 til it hurts so

184
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:09,889
if you put this this just capacitor
inductor circuit into one of the fields

185
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,689
like one of these badges make the hunter
25 coloreds feel it's gonna start

186
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:18,679
oscillating 225 kilohertz in kind of
help build up that field will now if we

187
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:23,559
start like clothes that circuit with
this transition as ISO setting is a

188
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,190
switch

189
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,660
your damping that field see basically
got a circuit oscillating here 805

190
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,580
kilohertz and you're turning it on and
off to dampen or or not damn bit and in

191
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,410
the end you end up with doing the same
exact thing is the card is doing so to

192
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,640
build this you solder that circuit
together you can get the code code is

193
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:51,310
really simple from gay.com and the demo
for this im just gonna show this video

194
00:15:51,310 --> 00:16:09,080
so yeah we'll pass that on to state that
around Michael

195
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,800
project to moving quickly but that's ok
a bit more Demi Moore demos coming up

196
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:33,400
any questions on the spoofer if you do
they make RFID

197
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,090
don't then you probably could yeah I
would think so if you have rewritable 1

198
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:43,130
I've been work with rewritable one
before what kind of writer do you need

199
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:56,360
then ok ok sounds like a radical tags
like a proximate to write to it up to me

200
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,230
see if I can get this device to write to
it they get those the next month I'm

201
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,560
gonna turn it over to my friend Michael
here was gonna talk about attendance

202
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:12,380
drop boxes so the Dropbox the wonderbra
primarily talking about today is the

203
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:18,060
mini poster which show Kevin came up
with originally in 2012 version one was

204
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,659
actually based off of this little guy

205
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:28,239
which is a tp-link 703 N that looks
exactly like this 702 but it's not you

206
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:35,139
have to get the 703 and from China to
get the 702 it does not work with a four

207
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:39,249
gig memory card and the the one
disadvantage with this is you didn't

208
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:44,769
need an external battery for it it's an
awesome little device obviously very

209
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:48,229
small compact but it takes a couple of
different things put together to make it

210
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:52,679
into a Dropbox so last year we got
together and start thinking about what

211
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,619
can how can we make this better right

212
00:17:54,619 --> 00:18:00,049
how can we make it more convenient so
what we decided to start using was the

213
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:08,159
the thirty forty which is one of these
guys rights I'm sure you are familiar

214
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:14,149
with the tp-link 3043 popular these days
doesn't internal battery internal

215
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:20,559
wireless same USB and then an Ethernet
port as well as some other advantages

216
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,940
I'll talk about a little bit with the
toggle switch but you can build your own

217
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,080
the code is out there are many ponder
dot com if you want to use it and trying

218
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,479
to make it a little easier as well but
for right now they're just build

219
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,820
instructions of you follow the
instructions I had good feedback they

220
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,859
say they work so you obviously need one
of these

221
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,169
get a

222
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:48,239
any kind of USB Drive USB Drive you want
I like the 16 gig preserve its cause

223
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:52,950
they're nice and small they don't get
hung up on anything right now still

224
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,210
using barrier breaker haven't tried the
was it

225
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,440
chaos chaos comer to have to look at the
code make sure seven work but barrier

226
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,359
breaker install that they are so many
poner overlay package that you download

227
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,239
it's a star file so put that on your
menu poner extracted as a setup script

228
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:14,519
and it basically builds them any harder
for you so very straightforward and then

229
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:23,070
you can install the notes from the
website itself so that's what you have

230
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,299
to do on the many poner you have to
actually set up the USB capability in

231
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:35,820
the tp-link 30 41st there is a there is
a trick to modifying the FSM

232
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:41,920
so this is what europe a stab you want
this to look like for the first time so

233
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:49,110
your target is the overlayer devices St
STA too and then you have some different

234
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:55,560
options up top there so you do that once
then you have to do the paper route goes

235
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,410
all familiar with that very
straightforward process those are the

236
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:05,450
commands it to use you have to edit at
see Config Aftab again in a couple

237
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:11,440
things you want to change your target
now should be / and put a delay in your

238
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,390
option and they're now when it boots up
it'll be booting off of their boot up

239
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,500
but then I'll read the operating system
off the USB Drive so now you have that

240
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:29,140
16 gig that's the magic trick to that of
course you install any packages you

241
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:35,880
wanna get a list of recommended packages
that we like to use the Site I said

242
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,180
before playing the overlay is very
straightforward run the setup script

243
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:46,420
like I was saying okay so the
three-position switch on the side we

244
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,169
came up with

245
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:53,929
this little thing called many boats that
were too many mode allows you to do is

246
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:58,019
you can control it through the
three-position switch so the opposition

247
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,480
has always set up but then you have the
ability to predefined so if you wanted

248
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,820
to set up for walking with kismet if you
want to set it up for a rogue access

249
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,700
point to turn on you know I don't know
tcpdump with some German flags are

250
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,830
starting nmap scan or do do whatever you
can think what you can do is take a look

251
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,220
at the site for just a file structure on
one of these right just Linux so under /

252
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,019
many poner many modes you can actually
build out files folder structure and

253
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,950
when it boots up in a read that and they
will become a mini mode you put bash

254
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,779
scripts for Allscripts or Python scripts
in there it will execute that code so as

255
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:39,669
you flip the switch will execute that
code for you so walking into a pen test

256
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:46,629
I can now have the setup to do two
things wrap the back and if gosh I get

257
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:49,999
there in there something else I don't
think it would be really great if I had

258
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:55,440
more walking device I could go into the
web interface

259
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,809
wonderful HTML skills here you can go to
the web interface and use the drop downs

260
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:06,980
revenue many mode and then instantly
flip the switch its debt that new new

261
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,489
settings so very easy I was kind of a
goal because I'm extremely lazy so I

262
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:16,029
like to automate as much as humanly
possible

263
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:22,460
moving forward started making what we're
calling the Black Edition is based off

264
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:28,100
of the thirty forty as well as one of
these guys right here so it's still

265
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,700
thirty forty but what we've done is
taken out to the led to power LED hard

266
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:40,080
to see but to be right there basically
just broke that so there's no longer

267
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,739
power LED on it so it will flash it to
the correct antenna and gave direct

268
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:50,879
secure a serial access so you don't
actually have to open it up I've done

269
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:57,190
that for you and of course wrapped in a
very stylish matt black bible

270
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:05,700
who doesn't love matt black vinyl but
not the area's know the eighties tonight

271
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:15,629
but with some of those thirty forty
pretty easy to actually hang with some

272
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:19,869
of those changes you can see Michael
here there's a four pin header therefore

273
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:22,889
the serial interface so you not to go
find pads or whatever there's actually

274
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:28,309
pin holes for it and others not a good
connector for the antenna connector it's

275
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:32,940
a matter of knocking off a resistor and
soldering iron citing the intended to

276
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,659
the point where there is a resistor was
so that's how you can do to yours as

277
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:37,809
well

278
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:42,889
absolutely and I i cant take full credit
for all this actually somebody on the

279
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:49,320
menu planner forums originally Posted
this I don't remember his name but he

280
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,769
gave me the original idea to to do the
antenna mod it is it is very difficult

281
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,450
obviously it's a very small in there
you'll notice a little black piece of

282
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,119
tape what I do is I knocked up the
resistor

283
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:06,399
put a piece of black tape over the other
end otherwise I and upside down to both

284
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:16,940
doesn't like that very much so that is
the point of black also comes with three

285
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,520
TV antenna obviously could come need one

286
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:27,980
so we are working on new interface
trying to go with marble web based thing

287
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,500
it's not gonna be full functionality

288
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,120
that's not the goal obviously I'm a big
believer in the command line I'd like to

289
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,880
take things but it's hard to do from
your phone right if you're dropping this

290
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,020
box off you want to have some ability to
get into the box and do something with

291
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,460
it while you're on site so the goal is
really just a built-in web interface you

292
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,050
can point click and pull down so many
modes or or change in settings are

293
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:56,060
starting nmap scan do some some basic
function so you guys have any ideas

294
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:01,640
that's what I'd love to hear from from
you on created another package of many

295
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,800
modes hopefully we'll be coming out soon

296
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,490
was really hoping to have it done for
this weekend but that just wasn't gonna

297
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,850
happen and the forums if you look at the
forums there's actually a new thread

298
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:18,590
that started for future ideas so I'm
trying to gather ideas for anything you

299
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,420
guys would like to see it do in the
future will certainly take those and see

300
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,220
what what we can do it though so there's
functionality that you wanna know

301
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,260
karma's a bitch when I get asked about
that quite a bit but there's other

302
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:57,080
things that we want to do let us know
the questions were they are led to it we

303
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,050
certainly could look at that no I never
given it any thought

304
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:07,080
yeah one of the problems it is a flush
mount LED so it is pretty difficult

305
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,170
solder in there I'm not the world's best
soccer but certainly could give it a

306
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:12,550
shot

307
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,970
that's that's a good idea and also lot
of these anna nova 30 40 but many of

308
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,590
them have extra GPIO pins that are in
use that you could find a pad desire to

309
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,850
seek potentially you know look up so you
know I think the power LED an office

310
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,660
controlled by the CPU urges goes out on
the powers out yeah but there's other

311
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,780
pads but there's other pets that
actually a GPIO you can actually

312
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,910
manipulate those know what we're talking
about LEDs that's what I want to mention

313
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,050
the so the reason I broke the power LED
is because you can't control through GPO

314
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,030
it's just on the powers on and there's
no ifs and buts about it but the other

315
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,250
three LEDs are on there you can actually
control through GPO settings so I can

316
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,780
make it go completely dark put in a
corner and you're not going to see it

317
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:05,740
rape or also we like to use the LEDs for
finding stuff right so LED is on we go

318
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,360
around for plugging it into different
parts when it gets a connection the LED

319
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,190
turns off

320
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,179
you know they can use that as as a
little feedback in the care so we also

321
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:20,690
have three LEDs to contemplate with
right and you had a second question but

322
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,940
the web interface it's not on a get home
right now I'm actually not the one

323
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:31,919
developing it cause clearly I do not
have the skills to HTML anything so it's

324
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,850
actually going to be based off of sort
of you guys have ever seen that

325
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:41,509
interface where I'm working with the
developer of sore right now he's

326
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:46,879
actually creating a new interface which
is where r prototyping it out right now

327
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:53,919
he should be launching in on his site
next week so stay tuned to that but yeah

328
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,340
it's not about putting the code up on
get up and make it more official you

329
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:04,710
know right now it's it's me and I really
do I want I want help I want people from

330
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:25,320
the community to China you know and tell
me what you have a question Bluetooth

331
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,230
serial adapters no I haven't haven't had
the time to do one of those yet there's

332
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,690
no room in the box so would have to be
an add-on like maybe tape onto the case

333
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,950
but it's certainly something that's a
good idea

334
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:43,299
one of the challenges you come in as
it's like that one USB port so you gotta

335
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:48,820
kind of shoes on a USB thumb drive there
are a lot of Bluetooth part gets messy

336
00:28:48,820 --> 00:29:02,860
yeah

337
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,600
power but I could probably do some
creative hacking to get something to

338
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,170
happen very small parts inside there
though that's probably one of the

339
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,470
downfalls with thirty forty the 703 was
nice to work with its kind of a square

340
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,150
box and the board's thin so you have a
little air space in there to decide on

341
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:25,809
other wires and doing things the thirty
forty if you are certainly welcome to

342
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:30,710
take a look at this but the serial port
there's there's so little space I

343
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:36,679
actually have to mail out a slot on the
cover to get the numbers in there so

344
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:52,720
it's it's very very tight inside show so
next up local WiFi antenna so how many

345
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,280
people have tried building a contender
before I did those things and i cant and

346
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,870
im gonna build one and I built one and
it didn't work for crap and then I found

347
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,549
a design for like billion it was a
little tedious because it's very exact

348
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:10,710
measurements in this and that I built it
didn't work for crafts and I came across

349
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:16,730
this is really cool so i thought id
share this is just a number of different

350
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:22,929
pictures of the clinton is so helical
antenna the orientation of the signal is

351
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:29,660
actually I'm going to say this but it's
not vertical or horizontal like a linear

352
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:35,940
antenna but actually it most signals
aren't truly linear or circular they're

353
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:42,730
just some variation of both of these
were pretty well even for that and you

354
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,669
can build them for a variety of
different frequencies like the one we're

355
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:52,120
building here Sutra 2.4 gigahertz but
we'll see a calculator rekindle 145

356
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,540
gigahertz if you wanna do a $2 na
hEireann or something like that but it's

357
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,260
nice because I built it actually works
so apparently did something right

358
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,210
compared to those other two it wasn't
that hard expensive to build either

359
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:11,320
let's take a look at that the first one
I felt was this wooden version 1 I just

360
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:18,600
the key things with the we'll get to it
is just the spacing of oil so they

361
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,470
wouldn't want was nice to have
woodworking tools to actually cut groups

362
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,390
although all that fell in the right
place but I thought well here for the

363
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,570
kind that everybody's gonna have you
know radial arm saw that they can do

364
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,940
this kind of stuff so let's find an
easier way but that was the first one

365
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,960
the second annual pass it around is is
what I came up with kind of a kind here

366
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:44,560
it's a very flexible platform she really
only need a few parts they skip that

367
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:50,770
already added skipping you basically the
people who send their love each other

368
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:58,380
parts on it sorry like senator reflector
and that with the reflector needs to be

369
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,330
basically as big as the wave like the
way you're doing so this is 2.4

370
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:07,740
gigahertz which means the wavelength is
about 4.8 inches this plate is actually

371
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,770
just a tiny bit shorter than that so I'm
probably moving a little signal for any

372
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,030
you know for certain ways that are
coming at me but I wasn't worried too

373
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:21,090
much about it you can find pretty much
any flat metal reflector to be reflector

374
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:28,050
and then you need some way to have this
coil be based appropriately and have

375
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:32,900
internal diameter of just over 1.5
inches and we'll see how we get to that

376
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:41,470
it's that might be out there to be a
little bit too small but not really

377
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:49,910
enough to smaller worried about ya yet
succinct drain pipe I think was so so

378
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,530
here we get the parts we need we need 14
gauge wire which isn't hard to find his

379
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:58,350
$0.18 afoot at Home Depot you need a to
be wrapped around its 1.5 inch OD

380
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:04,710
unfortunately none of the PBC again the
store as 1.5 inch OD but this tail piece

381
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:10,810
for your bathroom sink or whatever is
exactly 1.5 inch OD so that works out

382
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:17,880
well like two bucks for that we need a
flat metal discs for the bottom

383
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,430
and I just shopped around like I was at
Walmart he could have gotten hot cocoa

384
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:26,350
and use the bottom of that can hear at
Home Depot they had some I think that

385
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,400
was aluminum flashing that was like five
by eight inch which should have been

386
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,930
perfect I liked this metal plate there
was an electrical liar because it was

387
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:41,200
very rigid and another thing you need is
a little piece of copper metal strip

388
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,060
disease or cider will talk about why we
need that it's true impedance matching

389
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:50,230
how do we build that things come around

390
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,770
well the first thing is gotta figure out
how we're going to connect the 22 that

391
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,640
reflector I've done with hot glue I saw
somebody had a good idea of connecting

392
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,120
it with zip ties and that's how this one
that's going around goes on as it is

393
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,410
plastic and they're kinda nice you can
disconnect they hold it really rigidly

394
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,370
so I just hard to see but I've got holes
in the plate there and then holes in the

395
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:16,050
tube that lineup and I just because it
ties to that connected and the up to

396
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:21,780
mark the 24 that coil I kind of skipped
how you get to that there's calculators

397
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,760
out there on the Internet where you say
ok I wanna 2.4 gigahertz 1010 in this

398
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,850
case i said im gonna use inches as my
units to point where 240 2425 megahertz

399
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,320
or 2.4 gigahertz so it's telling me my
wavelength is four point eight seven

400
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,070
inches diameter to my need to use and
that's what I said so we see the

401
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:46,190
diameter the diameter of the coil needs
to be 1.61 inches so I'm thinking if I

402
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,050
wrap

403
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,440
14 gauge wire on the outside of a 1.5
inch 2 I've got to be pretty close to

404
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,840
one point six inches of the diameter
that coil itself you know how many turns

405
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,490
so if you if you end up with a longer
and more turns you get less efficiency

406
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:08,720
began a narrow bandwidth you know kind
of the 529 is probably a good range for

407
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:15,000
the length and all that kind of stuff
yeah that's how you figure it you can

408
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,550
put five megahertz in there and in the
smaller antenna but it would work for

409
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:23,040
five gigahertz please interrupt me cause
I know if you have questions cuz I don't

410
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,000
think to look up as often as they should
remark to hear a spaced it out one and

411
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,810
three sixteenths inches and then
actually went to the other side the two

412
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,760
been made the same spacing but offset by
half of that so that I could figure out

413
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,470
how the warnings to go around the two
and then you know the next trick is to

414
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,980
find a dollar something around like a
broom handle that's a bit smaller than

415
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,740
just wrapped tightly around you get a
nice shape that way it's kind of tight

416
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,500
and I can take that call aware and
actually wrap it around my to you can

417
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,720
see the first step that I did was to
wrap it around and just you know roughly

418
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,710
tape it as close as I can to those marks
the coil was you know had a little

419
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,690
attention to it so is pulling itself out
of place but it kinda close enough that

420
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,280
I gotta lined up pretty well where the
next step what then was just take the

421
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,070
electrical tape and hold the wire right
over those marks in as a whole new era

422
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,880
is Mark's tape it down and that's why
you see coming around now so it's

423
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,030
actually pretty simple I think it turned
out pretty well there's other options

424
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:26,100
well like I said you could cut out wood
or other materials crews to actually get

425
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,860
the wired to fall into the right place
this seemed like a nice approach someone

426
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,070
who doesn't need any power tools other
than maybe some of the plaintiff that's

427
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:42,490
higher connecting to play down here epic
oil around the two so the antenna mounts

428
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,040
this is one of the challenging parts
it's not as easy to find at Walmart got

429
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,370
two options you can you can buy a
pigtail lead what you need is an RPS I'm

430
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:55,150
a it's the same thing is your standard
antenna has you can order them online

431
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,270
and Amazon are from China or something

432
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,070
I've built a couple of these antennas
were all I've done is taken a standard

433
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:09,650
whip antenna she's about so many routers
here I should have one handy so I would

434
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:15,150
take one of these is Mike Michels baby
route but if you look inside of these

435
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,150
you'll see there's actually a little bit
cable and there before it gets up the

436
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,880
antenna

437
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,120
I've torn these antennas apart and use
them as my connector so I don't have a

438
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,970
don't wanna wait for ordering a pig
tails you could do that

439
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,680
tear apart in 10 you've got like how
many of us already have a couple hours

440
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,260
sitting back down to the basement cuz we
upgraded industry in the box but so that

441
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,520
antenna connector you got to connections
the shield of the ground of it needs to

442
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,040
connect to the reflector and then that
sent central pin the signal pin need to

443
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,840
connect the bottom of the antenna coil I
think of a better picture that coming up

444
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,450
here but before we get to that we had to
think about impedance matching so what

445
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,400
does impedance matching I'm not in our
engineer and it's really confusing for

446
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,080
me but basically my understanding of it
is if you got an alternating current

447
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,160
going through a circuit it's gonna have
impedance which is kind of a combination

448
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,780
the resistance of anything that's like a
resistor in the circuit as well as the

449
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,370
reactants which is the opposition to an
alternating current of certain devices

450
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:24,170
and things like that passes or whatever
and so to be able to transfer power from

451
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,350
one circuit to the next that's an
alternating current you need to match

452
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:33,190
the impedance of both sides I don't know
the magical people come up with this but

453
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:38,520
there's a guy who did this r/c groups
dot com I should have a screenshot of

454
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,080
that page but I don't but he actually
spent a lot of time testing a number of

455
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,070
different ways doing impedance matching
on helical antennas like this at 2.4

456
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:52,880
gigahertz in similar frequencies cause
he was building them for tracking r/c

457
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,920
like drones and things like that and he
said he came up with a couple of cool

458
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,560
isn't doing it the coolest and easiest
one he calls it a wave trap and you're

459
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,570
basically taking a strip of metal that's
an eighth of a wavelength wide by 16

460
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:11,730
convey the wave-like law which ends up
being a five-eighths inch by 5 16 cents

461
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:16,980
gigahertz just cutting out a
supplemental that size and soldering at

462
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,020
right after the the point on the antenna
so here's the first step I cut out that

463
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,300
little chip metal just the right size
and then I put a little be decided just

464
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,230
an edge of extinction have to solder
copper wire and then here's what it

465
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,690
looks like when the whole thing is done
so it's gotta be a certain distance from

466
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:40,100
the antenna connection point and then
it's gotta be so down to the wire

467
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,118
because I've got its side on the
internet connection point the shield of

468
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,460
the antenna connector is connected to
the reflector I've got that wave trapped

469
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,460
in there and based on the website I read
he said it works it seems too because I

470
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:59,580
sent an actually works pretty well for
me that's kind of the toughest part so

471
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,380
one of the things that I thought would
be cool would be to take one of these

472
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:10,160
antennas and you know I've done some of
the you know sitting in the city hall

473
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,540
parking lot like testing their wifi with
like an intent on the dashboard knowing

474
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,900
look suspicious so I thought when I look
less suspicious fires had a teddy bear

475
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,310
on the laptop or walking around but just
teddy bear so this has the antenna

476
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,790
sticking out the foot and reflectors
here in the head and I've got the

477
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,020
connector in the back lot about putting
a mini poster in sight of it so it's

478
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,680
also closed cuz you got the antenna
connection I'm a poner

479
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,119
yeah it's not that suspicious though the
first time I tried you know really used

480
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,080
it it still is kinda suspicious

481
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:46,970
make it a little more suspicious I don't
know that's the WiFi antenna any

482
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:52,750
questions I do not know the games I am
NOT an hour of Engineering and I

483
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,390
yeah the the calculator will tell you
what it should be

484
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,600
I'm sure I did a sloppy job so it
doesn't match that one of the things I

485
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,700
understand this huge clinton design is a
bit for giving it has a wide bandwidth

486
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,130
so if you don't got the coil just right
you know and and my experience is that

487
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,400
because like I said I built the content
it didn't work

488
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,240
yeah he didn't work I built this is like
how this works

489
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:29,680
yes so we actually talk this morning
about like paint Bank of routers inside

490
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,560
the building and we are testing like the
ability to connect to them and I

491
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,290
definitely saw stronger signal at the
bear the night with just the whip

492
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:41,110
antenna will not in the parking lot it
was only like the the power level

493
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:47,090
indicator on the on my wifi adapter was
only you know maybe five to ten more it

494
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,950
wasn't that substantial difference but
that's a substantial difference the

495
00:41:49,950 --> 00:42:03,910
power level indicators pretty short
ranged actually works

496
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:16,380
the only antenna that I purchased and
tried was a cheap aluminum Yagi antenna

497
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,829
thats like a square bar within like
aluminum round tubes through it and that

498
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:32,200
thing I think works worse then a whip
antenna

499
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:38,339
I'd be interested if too if I could ever
went through the effort of getting some

500
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:41,320
equipment that can measure gained I'd
love to like try some of my antennas

501
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,770
against like commercial antennas and
antenna do a bake off cuz I think

502
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,180
someone else did act like you know I've
purchased I purchased an antenna that

503
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:58,109
can go to school questions this next
one's going to be quick

504
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:02,410
it's a little inline sniff her so the
inspiration for this coming from a place

505
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:07,390
that so if you saw the estate place at
some years ago with the Snowdon leaks

506
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:12,140
one of the leaks was hey here's some old
documentation from the essay about

507
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:18,730
different gear that the NSE uses that
has fancy code names and does cool

508
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:22,290
things and i know its top secret so
don't actually putting slides showing

509
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:27,320
that actually here but here's just a
website that someone came up with hey

510
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,210
let's build the NSA place at which has
let's get some community open source

511
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,960
versions of each of these Dennis a tool
that they've built and so they had a

512
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,190
list of what are the ones you want to
build one of them here that they listen

513
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,990
to it was called fire walk by the NSA is
calling you build your own to you to

514
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:47,630
come with their own name for it that's
absurd as their tools but so there's

515
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,530
fire walk as a device that looks
identical to a higher standard rj45

516
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:56,050
socket but allows data to be monitored
monitor manipulated and I thought I can

517
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:04,500
build something probably kinda like that
yeah we can get my head around yeah yeah

518
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:11,490
I built one of these in and lost a talk
on somehow so sort of the parts for this

519
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:17,800
it's it's real important parts we got
this next 30 20 router which is similar

520
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,060
to the T peelings what's cool about the
next round it's got to USB to Ethernet

521
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:27,020
interfaces it's also really cool because
it's got a mega flash vs alot of TV

522
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,460
before she got a little more space for
programs on it but it's the same thing

523
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,720
yourself clashing with openwork like we
talked about what the many poner so

524
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,270
we've got our own Linux many variant
down there that we can manage with the

525
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:42,569
basically a little round with Linux and
then the stealing thing here as a power

526
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:45,570
over Ethernet splitter so the theory is
if you find a company it's running power

527
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:51,580
our Ethernet you could put the snow
middle of a cable and the power Ethernet

528
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,600
power your router and you still have an
Ethernet jack for whatever computers

529
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:02,600
plugged into it

530
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,400
well so I got a picture of that so so
this is this is the that set hooked

531
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,360
together and i actually headed up and
running and sniffing worked really well

532
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:17,430
you're not ended up passing the power
through it so if you know a PC is gonna

533
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,980
be connected this works thanks PCs are
power Ethernet but you can put this

534
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:26,330
behind an IP phone but another variant
III had put together this is the one

535
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:32,560
that lost attack on somehow but so you
know found a standard socket wall socket

536
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,110
the cover plate and you know kind of put
the wiring together I've got up in the

537
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,820
top the red there is the guts of that
next router in the bottom is just a

538
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:49,730
little Dec regulator that will go from
47 votes is power within what forty

539
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:55,590
volts far are you cannot bring it down
to 50 to the router runs on so if you

540
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:59,580
know that they've got a pou device down
the line you could use this to kind of

541
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,200
tap into that and just drained a little
power off of that that router only runs

542
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,700
like a hundred million up so we're not
really pulling much much juice with

543
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,980
doing it and this did fit in the whole
thing

544
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:18,030
five minutes holy sh oK so that's that
we're gonna go really fast thats place

545
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:22,840
you could hide it you can install
network stuff on it

546
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:30,200
yeah so these are beyond the website I
went to the next thing you know really

547
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,630
cool thing so because you don't have a
USB device and maybe you connect with

548
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,610
your WiFi you can run TCB jump on it to
capture the traffic going through the

549
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:41,500
Ethernet ports and then shipped out via
the wifi to your laptop with neck at

550
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:46,100
their command to do that so I can live
capture and stars on my laptop's that

551
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:53,590
story locally on the router and then the
bonus one will get to see it really fast

552
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:57,590
so I talked about how a lot of the
Arduino devices have that left two ya

553
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:02,850
chip you can use it as a USB adapter and
we talked about that this morning but

554
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:09,230
there's an Arduino board called leonardo
or the Arduino micro not the many but

555
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:14,310
the micro they're both based on this
ATMega 332 you chip and that has a USB

556
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,600
adapter built into it they don't need a
separate FTDI USB adapter and that means

557
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,810
you can make this device very easily a
USB keyboard or mouse what does that

558
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:26,920
mean what you could do a teensy style
USB attack if you marry that where you

559
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,290
just plug it in to a device the device
think it's a keyboard and you send

560
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:34,550
keystrokes like shell commands or
something like that or I built a script

561
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:39,320
to also know a trial where you plug it
in and it pretends it's a mouse to my

562
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,970
son a system and and it just moves the
mouse cursor very slowly kind of over

563
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:47,540
matter seconds in like a sine wave
pattern or whatever so if you try to use

564
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,870
the mouse likewise mouse drifting but
the other thing I thought about that

565
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,490
when I was getting ready for the
stalking my laptop kept locking was not

566
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,010
be nice to just turn it in to send a
couple miles strokes every five minutes

567
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:05,800
as a lock because this is cast the
corporate yeah so don't do that michael

568
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,350
says kaczynski count and the last thing
to do with this with the Arduino

569
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:18,390
Leonardo is making me but it's pretty
cool what the makey makey is it looks

570
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:24,829
like that but it's really simple circuit
basically the other making making is is

571
00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:31,140
a very high level resistor so this this
red circuit is what it normally looks

572
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:36,229
like he's got power which is 50 Conrad
going through a very high resistor to a

573
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:40,059
day depend as long as that that's the
only thing connected to it says im

574
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:44,079
positive im I'm a number one because
I've got power going to that but now if

575
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,579
we could something with even slightly
less resistance like a banana in that

576
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:52,999
circuit between ground now it says I'm
grounded I'm negative so you just turn

577
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:58,619
that switch off by touching a banana and
so they have a series of those you know

578
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:03,349
my little module here as 50 making nikki
has 18 of them but this is how you build

579
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:04,609
a circuit for it

580
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:08,589
you download the making a key code I
soldered together on a proto board here

581
00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:15,920
you can get this on the website now just
do the demo really quick which is only

582
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,759
bring up this so this is the making a
key piano works when I plug it in

583
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:39,569
so now it's got a keyboard and its
taking keystrokes or something everytime

584
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:52,039
I touch you so that you can build on
