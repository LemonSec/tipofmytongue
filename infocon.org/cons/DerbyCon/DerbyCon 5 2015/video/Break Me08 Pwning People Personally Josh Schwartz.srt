1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:45,090
good morning everybody

2
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:53,320
how many people at the party last night
wow that's a weird a weird thing to see

3
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:03,300
across 10 diagram model who was there
and who is here and I'm pretty surprised

4
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,939
but I guess I should have believed in
all of you a little more and for that I

5
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,600
apologize thank you for coming

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,080
how many people went to third Street
dive afterwards steel slightly less ok

7
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:23,920
ok so this is ponying people personally
or all the alliteration all the time I

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,460
guess

9
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:33,230
here's my about me sign the best day
I've ever had at work and then just to

10
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,630
kick this off I suppose we're just gonna
have to play a little bit of a pretend

11
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,380
game right I wanted to use real examples
but two heart attacks too much stuff so

12
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,990
just to make the stalker just kind of
started off and I came up with a premise

13
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,060
that before this is originally treated
for season 2 a brick-and-mortar came out

14
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,920
and if you've seen more to your

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,150
yeah it's a good show and imagined you
know an episode or two in the when the

16
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,590
season ends and we can apply the same
train of thought and it's still gonna

17
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:09,070
make sense we can pretend that no we
want to get inside the computers are

18
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,870
inside the servers that that how's
everything that has ready before the

19
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,890
season releases rights are gonna pretend
that they said yes you can you can read

20
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,769
team us you can come into our
environment and do whatever you need to

21
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:27,530
do to see if it's possible to steal the
RRR good send the goods being whatever

22
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:33,790
they happen you know storyboards
recordings so pretend now the first up

23
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:43,620
of cloning is recruited sins as bad for
you now we're gonna pretend actually be

24
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,120
quite creepy in order to accomplish this
you may be finding yourself ask my pants

25
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,390
is really creepy throughout this don't
worry that the first step in our in our

26
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,780
return instance is going to create a
creepy dock and use Google Docs for a

27
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,060
number of reasons and I'm using Google
lot for this and if in your head you're

28
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,000
saying she can't be putting stuff in
Google don't worry about it was being

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,970
stuck in there anyways let's assume that
our target is also putting stuff in

30
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,900
Google so they don't mind are putting
everything

31
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,000
there's a lot of value in it and in our
dock that we're gonna me wrapped up

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,540
something very personal profiles on
people to get some leverage and then

33
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,560
you'll see what we do and we're gonna
they're gonna build with pictures links

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
and notes and one of the reasons we're
gonna do this manually instead of

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,329
automating it all because as we do it
we're going to learn about the people of

36
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:42,489
a bit more and this will be useful in
creating a initial fish to get in and

37
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,780
then later determining who's valuable to
move too much and yes maybe you're like

38
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,930
creepy maybe like this time consuming
and maybe you're thinking well what is

39
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:59,569
my target company has a lot of employees
hosted by adults with Arabic writing

40
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,329
that we're looking for it

41
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:09,590
know right we're going to focus on the
things we want and then from that gonna

42
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,720
use that to find the exact people I want
my organization and then using those

43
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,579
people I'm going to get the thing I
actually want because they have access

44
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,739
to it already

45
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:28,169
now first up that I usually take is just
go like linkedin looking for no jobs

46
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,979
because I want people who already work
they're not top ads and just the thing

47
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,620
I'm interested in this case

48
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,880
morning big fan you can see as a
LinkedIn tabs I have opened that's just

49
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,070
the first what had you up all the sudden
start looking through it now as I was

50
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:51,380
going to screenshot everything and this
is going to actually if I put all these

51
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:57,440
screenshots into Google Drive Google 20
see our on so that later at any point in

52
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,570
time I'll be able to search for any
keyword if it appears anywhere in a pop

53
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,370
up with a screenshot something like this
for you to search for it and pop up on

54
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,330
the screen shots I can see everything
that was there when I originally sought

55
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:20,039
and there's a few tricks that I use on
OSX specifically because I can't search

56
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,110
within a folder seems like a pretty
basic functionality but its existing

57
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,639
drive it's just such as everything in
there and if you're doing you know

58
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,639
multiple engagements multiple targets
wanna be able to organize files so the

59
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,060
easiest way is just to name your
screenshot so they always have some kind

60
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,460
of identifiers so just ignore me to
script this but here's the command that

61
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,090
will change your screenshot name so I
can save my like engagement name is

62
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,880
bricked Nicholas bob is the guy that I'm
boxing at the moment so i cant call Bob

63
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,270
Nicholas that way I can have an
identifier of what I was kind of doing

64
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,349
at the time and then also you know the
project I was working at the time and

65
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,639
then to make uploading easier I can just
change the screenshot

66
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,039
location right to my Google Drive folder
with other so you have a script that you

67
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,870
constantly run as you from one target to
another updated a quick type in the name

68
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:17,539
of the person go so here we start on
LinkedIn was the first guy pull up and

69
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,810
and this is basically two screenshots of
like what I did when I decided to run

70
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,300
through this exercise in this is Casey I
just take screenshot the top of this

71
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:32,360
profile works read it obviously works on
the stuff I want pretty useful to me

72
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,900
takes me shopping study finds Google+
page on his personal website Twitter

73
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,180
Facebook page which has a really strange
information like is a lil instant

74
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,889
messenger name very it's still in guys
still on so if you want to add me fuzzy

75
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,200
not instant messenger

76
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,510
and then we just can't move on to the
next person now this guy when I told

77
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,280
them up I actually saw that he doesn't
work there anymore so it's kind of

78
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,970
screenshot of the page didn't dive on
him because he doesn't have access to

79
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:13,160
the things I want to repeat the process
again next person storyboard are going

80
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,320
through the same process for another
person in the end I end up with

81
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,920
something looks like a picture that dude
pictures avatar name there's like 10

82
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,820
Twitter Tumblr Facebook Instagram web
site YouTube Google+ where he lives on

83
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,390
her message as you know and some notes
about you know what he actually does and

84
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,200
why might be interested in him and I
have something the next person I have

85
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,360
something for the fastest and I just
three here and it's not a lot of

86
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,390
information personal financial picture
of him I don't have a ton of information

87
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,980
I don't really know a lot about this

88
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:56,070
Maximus screenshots so maybe I missed
something so I searched and I find is a

89
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,160
list of all the screenshots I had when I
was looking for something that smells

90
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,700
but then I also find her body present
and what are you doing up there in my

91
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,680
search results for Maximus told us up
well these guys are hanging out in real

92
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,150
life that's a very interesting fact
maybe these guys know each other maybe

93
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:21,720
they're good friends maybe they all went
to the same university other other girl

94
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:30,370
here so the reason of doing this is not
just solely to creep on people and while

95
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,530
it is kind of fun it's really about you
know finding someone to attack but

96
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:41,450
somehow it's actually more about
becoming this person because we can

97
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,620
craft a fish with you know a highly
targeted email judging on things that we

98
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,220
found on social media but if we find
enough stuff on social media about

99
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,870
someone we can just completely
impersonate you can become them and then

100
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,880
use that

101
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,190
trust that's already established between
people to their friends and I only built

102
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,260
three profiles here I was the first
three people I found my LinkedIn search

103
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,480
and interestingly enough all three are
connected in some way and typically I

104
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,060
would spend actually I would spend about
a week

105
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,030
building thirty 30 more profiles and
more profiles a half more connections

106
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:27,600
more taxer just doesn't know it isn't
always best to pick the two people that

107
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,360
you find the most closely connected
maybe it's good to find two people that

108
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,580
worked together at one point but maybe
you think they don't work together maybe

109
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,240
it's best you find people that you know
there's a slight familiarity but they're

110
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,390
not just like buddy buddy so because
Brandon Maximus hang out in real life I

111
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:57,740
prolly wouldn't use because I wouldn't
use branded Maximus they might be

112
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:08,290
chillin in real life at some point in
this file so let's put our and Google's

113
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:18,640
gonna help us here and I think someone
cool for parents are registered a

114
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:26,960
similar email retinal 11 and you know I
just had an extra one to the email he

115
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:34,120
actually uses so it's not too strange
and I'm gonna become my man in a

116
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,280
duplicate everything from his Google+
and so this is the original on the

117
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,210
duplicate on regional

118
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,170
I think it's different in this case
other than some dates of when things

119
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,190
were created as how many followers I
have and how many views

120
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,690
you can we can fix that actually now
when I use this personality that I

121
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,640
treated to

122
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,280
I'm not gonna just like start sending
two steps first up is gonna just be

123
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,650
established contact with people see if
he if they're actually going to talk to

124
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,380
me they're actually gonna believe who I
am because my first step is bringing

125
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,780
power out it only takes one person
that's like my nose isn't real

126
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,040
airport it and then suddenly my whole
campaign it's really that I have to bury

127
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,350
my tactics too much but if I pick a few
people I send targeted emails and they

128
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,480
say and yeah like I can totally check
this thing out for you that I can send

129
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,280
my actual payload and I am pretty sure
they're gonna running back not sure why

130
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:41,710
so here's what are normal dish looks
like standard email and when I'm doing

131
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,830
isn't saying hey I got this new kurta
time you know does it look ok on your

132
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,080
screen looks fine on my laptop my moms
that looks bad on her computer

133
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,630
come up with something better and hatch
my old dogs don't think it is dis be

134
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,700
duplicated their Google+ profile he was
gonna populate a lot of things for us

135
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:07,410
including the avatar that any recent
posts they had to put this inside the

136
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:16,680
circles it gives a lot of legitimacy to
the standard email you can just like you

137
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,020
can't have a jar to Gmail and yes you
can standard gmail accounts not gonna

138
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,790
block charts actually this is the list
of things that are blocked and there's

139
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,950
also a compressed archives that are
going to be scanned and blocked it they

140
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,529
have these types of files inside them as
well

141
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:40,029
now if you encounter official people who
apparently you know maybe running inside

142
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,629
a Google or that it's possible that they
could have a policy that does blocked

143
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:49,790
shots and that's a pretty common thing
that I've run into its actually not a

144
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:55,249
super problem even if you wanna even if
you still want to charge because Google

145
00:12:55,249 --> 00:13:03,999
actually yes we do is upload the blocks
file type to Google Drive and then we

146
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:07,839
share it to the victim and we can
include a message in there and then what

147
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,350
they're going to get a good look like
this can be sent on behalf of via Google

148
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,079
Drive with the same name and it may even
push my name my speech email up the

149
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:20,999
screen summit their screen resolution is
small enough and it's gonna say hey

150
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:27,879
here's the following files lol downs are
charging that you and click open for all

151
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:31,779
the populated info on the side with my
picture with my recent posts are still

152
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:40,389
there in Google search that the final
thanks google it if they download it's

153
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,879
like the style may be malicious but how
many times have you seen that still ran

154
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:51,079
it probably time and you may be thinking
does this work on taxis to better asset

155
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,689
does demo da txt comes right thru
delivered via Google Drive why not

156
00:13:55,689 --> 00:14:01,750
can send it through email but Google
hosted 41 that you like so here's here's

157
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,990
a real example

158
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,170
internal red team for a large company in
the Bay Area and they acquire companies

159
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,319
from time to time and we read team them
and I'm trying to get into a newly

160
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:23,070
acquired and I decide to target a UX UI
designer my girlfriend is a designer

161
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,040
I think I like I know a lot about this I
can easily pretend to be so this is

162
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,120
gonna be a really really awesome and so
from the parent company pending on from

163
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,840
the parent company I'm a guy that works
there and i've seen that we've acquired

164
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,410
the new company and I'm thinking like
that new companies super cool I would

165
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,130
like to go there instead because you
know it's got my office and I'm here at

166
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:51,150
this big company I think this is pretty
possible so I register this guy a brand

167
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:57,150
new Gmail phone is and I picked him also
because when his portfolio when you go

168
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:02,230
to quickly contact as it looks listing
his email so if someone sees this you

169
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,570
know like verify that it's the right
person where they reach out to his

170
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,740
portfolio and they might just reply to
my email because there's no I thought

171
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:20,870
that was an ass a hick at my names came
to UX UI design at company I came across

172
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,900
your profile online reach out now that
we are on the same big corporate

173
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,010
I'm looking to move to a smaller
opposite more and more intimate projects

174
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,010
I was wondering if I could pick your
brain a little doubt someone so

175
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,170
companies design team get a feel for the
culture in general scope projects before

176
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,610
I get too serious

177
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,150
sorry for bitching at historic prefer to
reach out to fellow designers directly

178
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,350
on the corporate now this was someone
that I found online during my initial

179
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,980
social recon and I saw that they were
designer I also saw that they posted

180
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,770
online publicly saying he reached out to
me as I want to hire people I want those

181
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:05,970
and i think is pretty successful and it
it feels no response and I'm very

182
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,890
anxious and every 10 days I get no
response I was expecting instant and I

183
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:16,000
felt sad that's your cue thank you

184
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,620
but then actually something magical
happened I get this damn it was great

185
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,720
and very serendipitous meeting you this
morning

186
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,600
coincidentally cat CC'd here happened to
catch your Email Backup filtered into

187
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,700
her spam folder this morning as well as
I mentioned they think it would be great

188
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,530
for the three of us to meet both live in
San Francisco be happy to meet up one

189
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,460
morning Thursday or Friday next week
work for you it certainly wouldn't mind

190
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,670
meeting at your stinky something sight
glass that is alex has been trying to

191
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:59,330
schedule a time for you to come by our
office for demos which i think will give

192
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,380
you a much better sense of the broader
company culture however we're moving to

193
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,319
a new office let me know there's a
morning works at this point I'm trying

194
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,190
to do is what's happened

195
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:17,400
this guy was actually doing the thing
that I've made up actually looking for

196
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,820
this job at this company actually worked
at the parent company and a leader on

197
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,400
the only reason I didn't get an instant
response to a message once lesson

198
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,260
learned here if you speed up a new gmail
account for someone to impersonate them

199
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:40,760
to let it eat like Council like you know
something that's better and if I send

200
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,270
some emails to some other counts I
controlled and like reply and waited a

201
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,460
few weeks this would not have gone to
spam but she knows that I created it

202
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:58,450
like email and they take it to stand
because that's part of the stuff that

203
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,910
this company uses internally and maybe
even part of their own merged my email

204
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:10,490
into another thread so suddenly my not
comes in and he liked our products to

205
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,600
take care of this emerging
communications together for us and they

206
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,320
go in and they like the same person so
now there's like one big threat with

207
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,700
them talking to this guy and I'm not
part of it and now in the Cliq plants

208
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,800
they're applying to means that have him
so that I learned this after the fact

209
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:34,300
and so basically I was like this of
course I send back this email I would

210
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,750
love to let me check my schedule and
I'll let you know what just better also

211
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,470
I've been working on some front-end UI
design trying to learn a bit of coding

212
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,710
on this website to diversify my skill
set up it I have a dental that I would

213
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,470
love to get your opinions on wasn't as
appreciated here but I think you guys

214
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,250
might find interesting it obviously
isn't official so you might have to

215
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,210
right click and click open to get it to
lunch

216
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:06,500
so this this app that's attached which
is a dmg cuz waiting ten days I hadn't

217
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,560
stopped doing other things and I had did
one fish and I got back this weather

218
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:20,040
like this message says job is not
installed compiled into Adium so the app

219
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,470
just as a Java error message and the
fact that the DMG whatever and I get two

220
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:42,750
shells and does not get a job there how
r ya so so you know maybe I can always

221
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,010
be psyche and a wizard and get that
lucky with officially and it doesn't it

222
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:54,450
doesn't always feel like that and you
know it's happening I am Not sure what I

223
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,650
was thinking when I decided to pick
these images to put their I thought

224
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:04,550
there'd be some context but honestly
sorry not turn so a little more personal

225
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:11,700
Google Hangouts direct messaging real
high you can see one of the interesting

226
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:23,200
things is if you've ever used in your
life that doesn't you can even like go

227
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,720
to options and you email so there are
three cop one is if you're into the

228
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,380
Gmail portion like the old legacy part
of the out and you try and copy someone

229
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,510
they're going to get this message that's
like so-and-so once the contact you now

230
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,760
there's this weird Google hangout
connector that exists that causes it to

231
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,250
show up like this so if you see this
it's almost always like this for

232
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,970
everybody but at first it has their name
on it and then the normal Google stuff

233
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,570
at the end if you click No here the next
time you send a message and the third in

234
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,010
the message will get this but it doesn't
have the fake name any more interesting

235
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,310
convo Google's trying to obviously
prevent the thing that I'm doing

236
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:13,280
if they say no after that they're
assuming you're a very spam you know in

237
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,200
person and they might want to block you
so the option to block now becomes

238
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,000
possible so be mindful that each
messages sent this in

239
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,500
but if you add them to a circle on
Google+

240
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,180
just trying to direct message that they
get like this and it looks really

241
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,420
doesn't have a fake email in there now
they get an email also looks like this

242
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:45,560
and I get this pop up within the
hangouts hangouts you see this at the

243
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:51,080
top so and so has added you to a circle
click Add one click and add them back

244
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,780
email one click Add circles indicated as
the back now once you have held you back

245
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,430
it's pretty interesting and if you're
asking like those is working people

246
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,790
actually use Google+ apparently yes and
here are some of my new friends this was

247
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:11,450
like five minutes of adding people and
to people added a couple people added me

248
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,150
after that that we're like friends of
those friends that I went and looked up

249
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:20,200
what they had to do it and now all these
people I can like direct message

250
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:28,760
now there is if they're inside a Google
or a custom they'll get a message looks

251
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,270
like this

252
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:37,220
left is the the web version like your
organization and then in the house

253
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,980
version like this at the top

254
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,570
now as soon as they like or interact
with the window at all the message

255
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:49,460
disappears so it's kind of a kind of
fish but it's kind of not and it kind of

256
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,730
depends you just have to be mindful that
that will show up so if you're

257
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,060
pretending to be inside the company but
if you're pretending to be on your

258
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:03,900
personal email at home after hours or
something like that that's actually yes

259
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:21,000
into it so they're starting to pay back
its gone and if they scroll it

260
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,150
disappears like after a few seconds so
with the default settings if they back

261
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,960
to a circle they they don't get the
funky message that's like someone is

262
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,370
trying to contact you

263
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,530
they just get contacted they don't have
the option to like approve you to

264
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:46,290
contact them because you're not mutually
trusted circles this you're not in the

265
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,840
same organization will still happen so
it doesn't hurt people circles on

266
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,440
Google+

267
00:23:52,440 --> 00:24:01,100
see what comes out of it anyone that has
a back message can leverage and so

268
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,620
here's another example of this is kind
of like when things go wrong here and

269
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:12,100
pretending to be this gentleman here on
the right now like a sack of the day

270
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:17,300
not till 5 p.m. then I get a response
all hey sorry I just saw now I'm using

271
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,390
this guy and hurting this girl because
he's kind of like but not quite the pool

272
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,670
from the sales team he leads a bond
sales team and she's on another sales

273
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,540
team and I can see that they worked
together in the past so I think they

274
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,920
have some mutual work together on a
daily basis

275
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:41,410
presumably so I get the message at five
and then around like I see that this

276
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,990
person saw as I say hope are you still
online so I figured there at home which

277
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:52,740
is probably a good time to target them
they say yes the streams of course

278
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:59,809
I'll talk tomorrow as I'm thinking
confirming my identity and another who

279
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:04,429
is this I'm standing next to James right
now

280
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,499
apparently apparently in the Bay Area
people were kind of heat

281
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:17,470
the good news is there's this button and
I just go away and move on I was nothing

282
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:23,210
there is no no no reports this weird
thing to security after I deleted it I

283
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,110
thought I should have just pretended to
be someone that he knew from college

284
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:33,440
like training him figure who this is
more it probably wouldn't have made a

285
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,639
difference by this anyways known
reported it ok so assuming that the

286
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,730
person repenting to be is not literally
standing next to the person we're trying

287
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:49,149
to target will probably a show and let's
assume that going forward the show we

288
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:52,850
have gives us like interactive SSH
session so we basically are typing at

289
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,549
the terminal on their boxeo

290
00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:24,379
and there is here I'm not gonna drink it
all morning

291
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:34,080
dialogue inside OSX to be secrete prompt
with anything and allow people to type

292
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,230
stuff in and you can choose whether
there's an OK and a counselor just an OK

293
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,330
and then you can choose from the console
basically making a pop up and say

294
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,639
something that Apple just assume the
iconic normally there is a couple of

295
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:49,850
different versions are you could get it
was like a little triangle on it you

296
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,460
could get it with a red circle on it
depending on the type of so and this is

297
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,169
basically just meet howling the system
preferences to activate and then pop up

298
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:01,320
a dialog box

299
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,380
that says software update requires a
password to continue

300
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,159
and that's it if I type it I get this
directly back to the terminal whatever

301
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:16,860
they type xscape goes away and I see
that they exited anything in which case

302
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,649
prompted again

303
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:21,870
your computer normally does it ask you
for your password an enormous you until

304
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:28,450
you type in not streams and then maybe
their system password password is

305
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,990
something that like households more
secrets maybe they have one past were

306
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,240
some other password manager just a
password manager pop up and say you know

307
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,500
like one Password requires a password

308
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,409
you know the last past doesn't even
exist could require a password so I

309
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:50,480
thought maybe I could use this and just
to show you like what it actually looks

310
00:27:50,480 --> 00:28:00,350
like an action when you run this command
tell the keychain access app secure

311
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:06,419
teaching how to prompt and say
resynchronization please enter your

312
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:20,159
token value using your continued does
not work probably tax return so this was

313
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,490
like hey you something on Windows using
powershell and it looks super legit so I

314
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,259
shot out to a friends really hit me up
on Twitter right after I personally

315
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:36,419
awesome music at checkout PowerShell too
and so this is three times the

316
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:41,700
PowerShell pops up with a small part of
the natural UI for Windows I would

317
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,590
totally type my password into this I
don't know that you guys were all very

318
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:51,980
paranoid but if my computer asked me for
my password so I was like that's really

319
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:58,750
cool but I didn't get to use that as an
engagement whereas on Windows box and

320
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,029
PowerShell is blocked at nine

321
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:07,210
and so in some cases no PowerShell sign
like Microsoft blocks that by bit nine

322
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,619
maybe you can get around to saying
PowerShell to the newest version is

323
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:16,669
someone going in an outing on the new
houses if they are is there a time when

324
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:22,259
though that may be a new version but so
you can't do that that's a job US jobs

325
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:26,450
the only thing you might want some
scripting language something that you

326
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:35,109
could use the computer and run something
doesn't have to be an executable so and

327
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:39,159
this is a shout out to one of the very
billion Spanish members of my team who

328
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:44,159
always comes up with the most devilish
things to do and you know sometimes I

329
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,989
chopping people's hands off and mailing
them to their kids to ask for password

330
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:51,619
which we don't normally do that but
sometimes it's something genius like

331
00:29:51,619 --> 00:30:00,460
this this is all job a full screen
overlay job looks like a lock screen at

332
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:06,249
my computer locked maybe I didn't type
in my password to unlock it cuz that's

333
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:10,549
what I always do and that's what you
always do and this works every time

334
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:18,129
sixty percent of the time and also set
up the cause for messaging me and being

335
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:23,009
like a check it out of her siblings to
you it's one command it looks legit the

336
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:28,249
background screen dims it prompts them
for this and I but in texts I could add

337
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:35,789
to the terminal that's so maybe have
already and now these these techniques

338
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:39,859
we just talked about a really good for
sale I don't know I just have the local

339
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:44,919
users and I want their but maybe I have
the ability to move laterally already

340
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:50,549
and I just wanna take more greedy so
he's up a model for credential

341
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:56,129
collection and not so good because you
need to install it but if you're in a

342
00:30:56,129 --> 00:31:00,249
box you can add up a model and then you
can suddenly get a siege credits from

343
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:04,339
anyone who walks into the box you could
suddenly get a sage crowds are you could

344
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:07,999
certainly get credit for you know
something like a screensaver so if you

345
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,020
wanted to you could do something like
this

346
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:19,840
so here we have is like a model and the
pair models pretty pretty simple it's

347
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,490
basically just the bare minimum that a
PAM module needs and what it's going to

348
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,420
do it's going to import the normal
libraries prepare models and just gonna

349
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,110
say hey like you then are prompting
preparing you can find examples of this

350
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:35,000
online and you just add one little extra
thing in here that is going to write out

351
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,770
the credentials into system also and
then you just go on and do whatever you

352
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:46,190
want to do that and so I don't think in
the interest of time I prepared last

353
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:55,310
night so in this instance I think it'd
be cool to the screensaver

354
00:31:55,310 --> 00:32:05,010
right now I don't think I tell my wife I
off so I need to add is off sufficient

355
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,260
and the name of my model right at the
top

356
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:15,800
edition is saying that ok if this off
its cool but if it doesn't it's cool to

357
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,270
just go on to the next one so you can
actually had like a backdoor on your

358
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:26,630
payment or even if someone types in like
a special password no matter what the

359
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,210
password is a Nazi shadow over or
anywhere else and system or how curb

360
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,850
works if it had been this password
approved and so even if I password

361
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:44,210
change you could keep access to an all
you do is actually just copy it to OSX

362
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:52,660
its very user live cam and then the name
and model uses the same way you

363
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,460
installing a pair model to enable your
device and then if you're at the

364
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,780
terminal and you know you're feeling
demolition in the case they use this it

365
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,050
was at the end of engagement had access
to to basically everything already but I

366
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,820
just wanted passwords running incident
response so you know they're responding

367
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,810
to me in the environment and getting
kicked out by saying look at all these

368
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:18,980
credit I can go to people on them would
if I had the credit this log in I can

369
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,760
see what their

370
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,550
doing in the incident response I can you
know get an email that you know that has

371
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,940
like the contact info for the bridge
that they're doing the instant response

372
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:39,350
on call in just listen to what they're
doing so only want to do this

373
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:56,860
screensaver pops up type my password in
suddenly it's so I can continue catching

374
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:08,220
criminals from a siege whatever but we
know if I'm on a box maybe I want

375
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,419
privilege escalation some other way and
maybe I am afraid to prompt the user has

376
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:17,610
their various and they they might
realize that there's something changes

377
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,940
going on and I don't want to talk so

378
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,460
password managers functionality of a
password manager is your go-to it click

379
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,659
click puts it in the clipboard
temporarily hopefully temporarily puts

380
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,490
on the clipboard into something else
over rights it and then you know that

381
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,760
you're able to piece it where you want
it to be so I don't just write of thing

382
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,480
that jumps out over and over and over
and over and over again

383
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:51,419
it works it's just thing it's kind of
slow so you might be wondering like man

384
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:55,200
whats the user doing on the box as
you're getting impatient but the

385
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,119
password isn't yet maybe want to see
what's on the screen on OS X 43 capture

386
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:04,460
the stache X is very important

387
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:13,630
without this you will get flash not
super stealthy and then the output file

388
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:22,400
it's interesting it doesn't require root
and it reflects the first thing I found

389
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,500
was this display 10 and then use gnome
screenshot well-known screenshot I

390
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,220
couldn't find a way to make the green
flash go away and it needs permissions

391
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,510
actually like killed an audio file
that's impossible to make that noise so

392
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:44,930
that people might be like what the fuck
is going on now I know that image there

393
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:49,600
since I think we need to know any ways
to steal the password you can see any

394
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,618
case you know we couldn't just a two
appt install ImageMagick and then we

395
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:58,760
could do something like 20 import /
silent very important the windows

396
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,790
through the entire desktop and then up
what we can do this heat capturing

397
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,890
what's on the screen

398
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,030
see what they're doing active are they
checking their email writing an email to

399
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,750
securities

400
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:15,600
interesting sidebar if they do write an
email saying he is doing something weird

401
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,569
if your password and you're in their
email you can easily follow up with

402
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:27,030
security on every house and say hey
nevermind everything's totally cool and

403
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,080
then you could do a little bit of inbox
management for them creating filters so

404
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,190
that anything from security is also just
sent directly to track and if that

405
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,700
happens I can tell you for certain it
will buy you at least an extra week in

406
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:51,720
the screenshots and windows to our show
links there so I thought maybe I wanna

407
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:59,570
know how to record audio to this isn't
something I rarely use I thought I could

408
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:07,770
leverage escape to do it could have been
so used already that harm his I started

409
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,890
to feel like this

410
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:14,490
the search goes like this be me decide
to add the slide gonna be easy to start

411
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,850
writing some apples skip everything is
going so it is recording only took 20

412
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,500
minutes

413
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,890
feeling very happy now all that's left
is to see if the file and then hours

414
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,080
later you still can't save the file and
it actually comes sandboxing issues in

415
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,000
the new version won't let it like have
this handled audio program and then let

416
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,630
that person have the permissions also
written to disk so I find the solution

417
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:43,530
it fixes for missionary and sticks but
actually nothing gets written today so

418
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:48,210
that actually find a solution for video
and it works this is video of the

419
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:54,250
desktop seek actually just screencap the
desktop and take off

420
00:37:54,250 --> 00:38:01,990
and doing this is amusing QuickTime
launch quick time making us grip trigger

421
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,570
an audio or a screen recording the same
time this is all just kept saying he

422
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:14,580
liked do these actions on my behalf or
on the user's behalf and then after it

423
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:21,880
does that move the file out of our temps
now the result is because I've set the

424
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,890
size of QuickTime to 1 pixel by one
pixel and I'm launching it if you click

425
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,040
the QuickTime thing pops up in the dark

426
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,050
not see anything it's time pops up and
then it's like done recording appears

427
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:40,290
and when I was trying to recreate this
over and over to like make sure it works

428
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,740
like you do it then all 3 I'm not doing
it every once in a while noting what

429
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:53,560
pop-up cool sometimes stuck with record
when that happens cool sometimes too

430
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:00,370
quick times but I don't watch dog
science in this case I suppose if you

431
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,620
click it nothing happens it works it's
not ideal time opening a bunch of times

432
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:12,770
they have brew install like to command
after this crazy you know the script

433
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,600
rabbit hole around down there

434
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:23,140
install reinstall socks I like that
we've recording audio easy peasy about

435
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,790
recording video from the camera it's
hard to think about this and I start

436
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,920
know too creepy and I didn't want to
deal with the like the light coming on

437
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,700
things like that I didn't want to try
and dig up that old exploit get it

438
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,170
working on new stuff because I'm pretty
sure that I wouldn't be able to do that

439
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:46,180
the real reason cookie stealing all this
audio and video recording it's it's

440
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,240
useful

441
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,820
but stealing cookies like it's the
cookie jar is really where everything

442
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:57,610
that I mean for cookies are delicious on
Linux is right there

443
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:02,860
Firefox cookies they're easy thing to do
is literally just grab that folder

444
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,380
take your via open up a SOCKS proxy
using your shell browse through their

445
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,010
computer that way you're avoiding any IP
by twisting and GIP vocation

446
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,250
restrictions and the traffic coming out
of their computer and you're using IBM

447
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,900
that's the same as their operating
system and use the same browser just

448
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:29,190
dump their folder or chrome storage into
your p.m. open up their everything's

449
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,880
working great

450
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,420
none of the stuff is actually encrypted
with a dynamic password and Linux or

451
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:40,760
chrome and firefox its terms encrypted
with the static passwords and Firefox is

452
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,210
just like so if you drop your stuff in
your browser with their session and if

453
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:54,630
you're going through their box here on
OSX there's the file it's actually

454
00:40:54,630 --> 00:41:00,300
encrypted now the key is inside chrome
safe storage value inside the key chain

455
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,050
which is really no problem you know you
could make the keychain ask them for

456
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,950
their password which is going to be
there

457
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:11,590
system password anyway as you can then
still out on your own system user

458
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,850
password to unlock it

459
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:19,430
grab this chrome safe stories from safe
storage value used to encrypt decrypt

460
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,980
them there's a

461
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,080
decrypt chrome cookies with pipe on
Google result that has a script that

462
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,160
only requires a few minor tweaks to get
working you insert your value you give

463
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,330
it a link to their cookie file about
their cookies in plain text that you can

464
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:43,880
insert them into your own browser either
sessions in has to have a windows like

465
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,940
more complicated in order to you
actually do this you need to make an API

466
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,619
calls you crypt unprotected data which
is fairly undocumented but if you just

467
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:57,140
take trips under tech data and you're on
the system he called this give it the

468
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:03,450
right parameters to MSDN it was just
decrypt the cookies for you this can be

469
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:10,910
done if you have access to it so in
conclusion of this cookies equal if you

470
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:16,820
can still cookies the browser did you
get everything this is when I get this

471
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,750
during a pen test suddenly like
everything just like cracks open right

472
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,700
as you have access to internal portals
internal wikis you have the sessions

473
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:31,270
already if not you have their password
you have a list of sites they go to see

474
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,790
what they what they normally do you
repeat the kind of same stuff that they

475
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:39,190
do cuz it's getting personal just repeat
what the user does you follow them to

476
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,590
the cookies are a good way looking at
their bash history following them around

477
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:50,910
through thats good way they use it this
is the end I like to shout out given

478
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,480
special thanks to Rick amore

479
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,140
not really allowing me to do this but
not caring that I did it anyway is not

480
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:03,100
saying yet Jesus for the inspiration has
helped millions for the very late nights

481
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,290
including but very best friend the
unassuming victims whose lives have been

482
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,560
forever altered

483
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:39,430
and all of you for listening and or
drinking is there any questions and

484
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:45,860
tokens with throughout now I'm not
entirely organization like that I

485
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:50,480
imagine so I imagine if they do that
right there is going to be out of window

486
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,530
of time in which the tokens on the
system and it's valid and asserts on the

487
00:43:54,530 --> 00:44:00,080
system and the users moving somewhere
already so in that case it if it won't

488
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,970
stop you really will slow you down right
so if you get the user is connecting

489
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,640
something already like you can follow
them there even if they have to update

490
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,530
you use something to prompt them get
there to have a credit immediately go to

491
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,230
the same place as they go you know it's
going to be valid as they've already

492
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:21,270
gone they're the only problem with that
is you need to get lateral movement two

493
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,550
systems you can figure out like hey I'm
not like X admins machine but I want to

494
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:31,420
be on like JoBros developer machine so
many things slower and you have to be

495
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,900
more targeted and fishing and you might
have to get really creative but I doubt

496
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,990
it would stop and the real goal is to
make things slower right so if you're

497
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,480
like enhancing security if you're if
you're trying to make medications for

498
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,410
the stuff you can't cover every single
creative solution right if you're on

499
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:53,620
someone's box you can but the goal is
that you make the window for the

500
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,190
detection much wider you have to jump
through all these hoops in order to

501
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:01,120
actually get to where you wanna go
haywire that section 10 is the more time

502
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,999
you have to respond to it the less
likely you lose all your data

503
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:12,749
thanks for the question now you get out
of here in 10 a.m. drinking thank you
