1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:45,020
alright I appreciate it while i'm
talking I'm gonna have the 3d are so low

2
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,660
appear running connected to the
transmitter so if you guys wanna mess

3
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,250
around with it I'm not gonna tell you
specifically how but you can put on my

4
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,079
Twitter and other stuff like that

5
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,030
figured out freely trivially I'd like to
fly this weekend's I'd prefer if you

6
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:05,070
don't are immature do anything too
messed up but again feel free to try to

7
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:11,650
crack the wifi password SSH into it but
again I'd like to flight leader so let's

8
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:17,909
try not to destroy my stuff please so
the shelling out on a smart room I'm

9
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,369
Kevin finish their this talk is gonna
primarily be about the 3d robotics solo

10
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:27,110
there's plenty of other products out
there

11
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,390
generically just kinda cover the bulk of
what should be applicable to all of them

12
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:39,990
again we've already introduced yourself
from Kevin this is Mike this kind of an

13
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,820
elephant in the room with regards to my
involvement the drone community in a

14
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,310
dress that here briefly but in general
the consumer driven industry is this

15
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,820
become a billion dollar industry and
there's lots of marketing dollars

16
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,299
involved the produxer proliferating all
over the place you know many of your

17
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:04,219
friends have them I'm sure you guys have
a Best Buy everywhere else is really a

18
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,170
number of emerging markets are popping
up as well

19
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,100
got farming and agricultural

20
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:16,829
stuff mapping surveying real estate
drones are here to sticker out regarding

21
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,120
the elephant couldn't talk about that a
little bit now I don't fall inside the

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,820
typical Marty marketing demographic I
usually speak up against inconsistent

23
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,290
season I really don't settle for bad
code in in a such I've been being from

24
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,220
one of the main communities called DIY
drones I've been playing multiple times

25
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,190
quite honestly I've also had a couple of
June satire counts that poked fun at the

26
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,830
various vendors and push them to write
better code bans from Twitter vendor dub

27
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,460
user error is it something that
generally fleiss's me I really push back

28
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,400
against that so a lot of the marketing
teams flat out there so that's the

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,170
elephant in the room regarding this talk
I'm not apologetic about that at all

30
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,160
it's generally for the good of the
industry and the people that are buying

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,380
these things for this talk specifically
it it's not really relevant there's

32
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:17,320
plenty of technical information that you
guys are welcome to Just you actually do

33
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,510
you own this product or not the sort of
the random folks it's flapping my gums

34
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,540
about it because I don't like the vendor
in it I know quite a bit about it I've

35
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,430
got some history with them as well

36
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:33,060
my own digital backfield you can see
down here so I am an actual user my

37
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,890
brother got oh my point in this is
really I've been on I have a lot less

38
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,740
experienced staff I kind of got a number
but when I started looking at him I

39
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,540
started looking at some of the protocols
cometary IRC systems and thinking

40
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,960
there's just no security here there's
implementations to work around

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,910
interference but there's no security in
the Meadowlands its heart started to

42
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,010
talk about maybe trying two attackers
and look at them and so we have

43
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,580
something to go on about that

44
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,240
yesterday way from Mikey bytes in here
is radioactive so he's not your average

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,260
monkey so why are we doing this stuff I
honestly I kind of played into the

46
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,970
marketing a little bit this is
supposedly the first mark room so we're

47
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,450
technically the first marker and hackers
obviously there's internet needs about

48
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,440
people who are actually first I don't
know formally the first I'm sure there's

49
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,730
plenty people that don't talk about
stuff I'm also kind of a consumer

50
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,190
advocate in this arena I bought a lot of
this equipment a lot of its garbage alot

51
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,260
of it doesn't live up to the marketing
and I like to share my experience that

52
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:46,280
will subsequently stuff as well it's
also an element of state D concerns in

53
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,030
this stuff

54
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,790
literally looking into flying lawnmower
so it's it's pretty obvious to figure

55
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,640
out what happens when you got something
with large irritating blades may have

56
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,130
bad code on it

57
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,300
people that think they don't have these
drums be shut out of the sky or whatever

58
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,050
reality of it is they are very dangerous
especially in four colors and proudly

59
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:14,020
there's an element of software
development lifecycle in QA that goes

60
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,230
into this is well I'm kind of a stickler
on this things you know if somebody's

61
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,140
going to sell me something and they
claim its robust just better be robust

62
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,700
an issue with this craft here where I
was flying in manual mood yet it was too

63
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,770
stupid to determine that I wanted to
land on it soon as a landing detector

64
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,600
that currently was broken

65
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,740
wouldn't detect me landing properly so
police at my gear flying the side of a

66
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,540
bridge or burn out onto the motors
because the crash detector also

67
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,650
so again . back to the development
lifecycle I don't know whose job that

68
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,960
was but the flat out didn't do it again

69
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,220
people ask us all the time why are we
doing this stuff to me there's no

70
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,590
shortage of idiots out there we've seen
you know drunk agent grasses DUI phantom

71
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,790
in the white house you've got folks
tossing bricks and meth and coke over

72
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,890
the border into prisons and what not
with this witness Quitman apparently

73
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,930
when you buy a fan of a rite of passage
to go fly the thing in an airport what

74
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,740
that's all about

75
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,080
played and it pleased you guys by
teasing stop doing that it's it's really

76
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,750
given the hobby a bad name

77
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,810
recent protests in Japan we got a
gentleman that strapped piece of

78
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,920
radioactive material to a phantom again
and send it over a government building I

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,110
think during some sort of nuclear
negotiations on proliferation and

80
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,370
whatnot obviously was kind of sending a
message we've also had some contrived

81
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,110
threats from our own Department of
Homeland Security they've attached c4

82
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,920
and other explosives to the bottom of
the phantom and implied that somebody

83
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,270
could do something terrorists with it
even has actually flown these things are

84
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,480
probably roll their eyes out it is they
realize it's not very realistic scenario

85
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,080
we've also got folks that are attaching
guns do these things

86
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,640
couple months back we had a guy put a
nine-millimeter on a quadcopter all

87
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,720
through the news

88
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,800
super scary again we've seen
thirty-eight snub nose pistols all kinds

89
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:23,000
of fun stuff attached her to this year
is really as 2008 even a guy that took a

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,580
Bergen helicopter a small gash dropper
and put a nine-millimeter on the front

91
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,170
of it with a servile actuator and he's
out the back woods somewhere popping off

92
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:37,590
shots thing so you know my opinion
seeing guns tattoo copters really isn't

93
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,520
anything new

94
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,660
it's been done before but again as far
as the media

95
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,980
in coming up with scary new things to
talk about and start being things you

96
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:54,740
know this is sort of stuff those folks
love to see it again recently we've seen

97
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,320
a tus opens the muddy ditch this actual
craft here that through your solo crash

98
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,460
in the stands at the USO been I don't
know what that guy was thinking but

99
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,770
again these things are becoming a
problem from the standpoint of you know

100
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,170
you got it it's flying everywhere
because of that you know we're winding

101
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,350
up with a legitimate market for drone
forensics and litigation is low so you

102
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,840
know you're interested in you know when
you emerging market around runes

103
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,750
something really interesting to look
into a such June detection in denial is

104
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,960
popping up quite frequently now there's
also some controlled interdiction that's

105
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,270
coming up as an option if you google
around you'll find several companies

106
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,410
have added this stuff driven detector is
one that i think is doing it better than

107
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,570
some of the others but again there's a
number of folks that are looking into

108
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:51,280
this stuff I think if you look out there
you'll see that there's some sort of the

109
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,720
government's interested in using this as
well

110
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,800
denial and interdiction

111
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,690
for each for both of those in again I go
back to the safe yes but I know a lot

112
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,100
about orientation of the pilot takes
over what you doin it wrong when you do

113
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,130
force it out of the sky when you forcing
it into and that's part of what we're

114
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,650
talking about here is a lot of logic
involved in understanding how to take

115
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,150
control of something successfully in not
doing it we're going to harm somebody

116
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,280
else so I wrote my initial paper on a
three-year solo one of the first groups

117
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,060
to download it was a marked X in ICUs
Army's aviation and missile research

118
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,330
development of new york's centre and if
you google and our deck and rooms you'll

119
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,080
find they have a platform that you're
trying to create two military bases and

120
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,090
stuff like that for you interdiction in
denial basically Boeing also has a laser

121
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,920
they can chew stuff out of the air

122
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,630
to mike's point your multiple times one
of my friends said you know anything

123
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,910
better than falling through it as a
falling burning so again I don't know

124
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,250
what the use case for that is but if you
think back to the USA opener that

125
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,880
through your solo was there you know so
landing in the stands out as big of a

126
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,949
deal but a fireball ending in the stands
is kind of a big deal

127
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:15,000
lipos they are highly flammable and
oftentimes explosive in in most rooms

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,639
have them on them so again these
platforms are popping up all over the

129
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,250
place they're not just low greed you
know consumer products that there's some

130
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,490
military grade hardware that the popup
to stop the store the stuff so it's

131
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,320
really a large emerging market turns
around six is also becoming a thing

132
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,750
David Kovar khobar on Twitter Dec Kovar
is a good resource to follow there was a

133
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,029
lot of physical evidence on this
equipment so if you're looking at for

134
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,079
example one of these folks is talk to
brick over the border

135
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,920
you know a lot of time to TJs wants to
know where that came from

136
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,070
so if you get a hold of the aircraft
there may be some artifacts even pull

137
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,250
off ships reasonable to help figure out
what was the original flight plan and

138
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,829
fortunately with a lot of these things
turn off the light planes are white so

139
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,140
people are wondering where they are they
actually white touring in is there some

140
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,670
forensic evidence left behind you got
tablets and laptops are being used for

141
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,199
control devices in the radios themselves
on the floor actually as a Linux box

142
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:23,720
inside of it so again you're you're back
to our traditional you know forensic

143
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:31,230
world in 80 and I know everyone says
different here a little there was a guy

144
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:38,420
he said on the ground six-year-old
daughter and the media

145
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,029
and the media was all over his side of
the story and it wasn't so few days

146
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,230
later that the operation came out with
its 2013 dayton was and was able to map

147
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,240
it as they become a little clearer
pictures where his craft was when it

148
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,769
faces the story was dudes daughter was
in the pool sun bathing and this guy

149
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:00,310
came over with his drinking and was
taking pictures over in reality what he

150
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,310
was doing was a real estate the guys
neighbor that was trying to sell his

151
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,459
house so that the telemetry actually
soon the dude was nowhere near the back

152
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:13,110
yard and was corroborated the story so
again David Kovar is a good resource for

153
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,730
that stuff he's gotta talk at it seems
that dives into some of these concepts

154
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,570
now one of the targeted concepts is the
real time analysis you actually do crack

155
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,310
into a drone may be able to take over
the telemetry stream in from there you

156
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,649
can extract things like GPS location of
the craft cell in some cases the

157
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:40,230
operator of the things that might help
you locate that WTI phantom so it's the

158
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,360
search and that protocol they basically
take cereal and and write it out of

159
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,880
packets real tribute to privacy concerns
is another reason that we kinda looked

160
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,160
into this research again people are
freaking out about what can you do

161
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,610
flying over my house refinery my yard so
you know as as mike mentioned we we had

162
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,760
a gentleman hearings for somebody was
spying on his daughter last year we

163
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,930
actually had a kid that got beat up in a
beach after flying in a video on his

164
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,160
chopper this lady walking up to me like
assaulting it's pretty funny if you

165
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,040
watch it so that pistol during a couple
slides back oddly enough the scene kid

166
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,660
me that pistol true so I would probably
think twice about a costing

167
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:37,700
in Colorado he had a small town that was
selling drugs hunting licenses so you're

168
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,600
not be garbage and it wasn't legit but I
do have one signed by the local council

169
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:52,950
that there's also companies popping up
selling true loads for shotguns again

170
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:58,880
the marketing is is dumped in full force
on this I think another interesting

171
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,480
aspect of this kind of led me to want to
research is the fact that you've got

172
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,370
police military and actually militants
so making used off-the-shelf equipment

173
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,720
that its subsequently enabling them to
you

174
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,760
surveyor counter survey somebody so
that's interesting in itself again

175
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,800
considering the fact that dr. shelf
stuff anyone if you can pick it up so

176
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,600
you'd be foolish to think their police
departments are buying phantoms and

177
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:42,230
solos and other off the shelf stuff in
it is they are so honestly some of this

178
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,020
research and its kinda I want to steal
me at Amazon Prime June maybe Jackson

179
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:57,510
packages in in some of these guys are
drugs that stuff she steals you seen the

180
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,840
Amazon adver they're talking about you
know packages in certain cities in

181
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,890
action during trials I forget where I D
she'll also doing the same thing in

182
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:14,720
Africa matter net is experimenting with
pharmaceutical drugs in deliveries you

183
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,370
places where infrastructure is denied so
you know how many roads but you can fly

184
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:25,580
something out there that the first from
the city I think there was a delay

185
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:31,610
delivery of birth control from Poland to
a neighboring country that controls

186
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,600
illegal

187
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:42,360
Cisco good at Rees . delivery and get
you some dank nugs their drones so you

188
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,690
know again I think if you're in San
Francisco

189
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:53,420
project maybe hijack some of these
deliveries so true command-and-control

190
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:03,660
rights community basically legacy not
smart classes haven't been through

191
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,600
talking about the radio control
environmental limits very old school

192
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,069
grounds they have am/fm

193
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:19,420
example 2749 bigger radio controllers
Aug 3 45 channel maybe this is stuck

194
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,180
here grab all my house cleaning the
garage or those of us that it played

195
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:31,300
with his things and we are on the right
here

196
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,370
on the right get a spectrum now this is
kind of what I would say is the best in

197
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,560
class today as far as what most people
are trying to point for gigahertz it's

198
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,620
basically a frequency hopping spread
spectrum using a cypress ship was a lot

199
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,060
of the different transmitters are you
today

200
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:56,250
imagery this is enviable 232 yards three
are used for 33 1988 as they have their

201
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,990
own frequency hopping over them that
they calculate will talk about that

202
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,600
little bit more but additionally from
our standpoint you have long range

203
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,329
systems operating in UHF as well and
using those are coupled with FPV these

204
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,170
and these can operate in a number of
different frequencies you get the kind

205
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,540
of figure out which is best a senior
operating environment but this allows

206
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,829
you to maintain a visual from the craft
wire operating it you know maybe half a

207
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:28,790
mile away so the main point here is is
across the spectrum there's a number of

208
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,950
different options as far as frequencies
go that may enable you to various pilots

209
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,740
are picking berries frequencies to
piloting experience in every crafters

210
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,470
different could be set up differently
from the channels etcetera to what type

211
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,740
of frequencies or so some of the newer
stuff again like this treaty robotics

212
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:53,309
smart roone they're making use of common
Android tablets and an iPhone iOS

213
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:59,620
devices in there in essence using the
standard wi-fi connectivity to provide

214
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,790
that pilot experience for you and some
of them are also enabling the cellular

215
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:10,910
connection to be an evil like flying so
think of malware on your Sony Tablet

216
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,190
that's generally a problem is it is but
when you think of the fact that you

217
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,419
might be using that flyer Troon I think
that's a more significant problems in

218
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:24,280
the fact that somebody might knock knock
yourself out of the years to you later

219
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,440
whatever so this point you're probably
game for Mr Allison of the stuff and

220
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,100
which really trivial did you sell you
can dive in with the latest research

221
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,710
user which is pretty standard for
expensive software defined radios

222
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,980
where you get the poor man trout and use
the RTL SDR either way either one of

223
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,070
these products allow you to cover a good
chunk of the spectrum of frequency and

224
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:57,600
be in these radios and Isis a car f1 is
another the same line of products it's a

225
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,950
little bit more affordable pending
between those two on the last slide but

226
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,039
again if you've been paying attention in
the radio seen we've got folks like

227
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:12,380
Travis Goodspeed my Crosman that have
been put out wonderful tools in miami is

228
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,559
one of those that the loud subdued hurts
radio analysis took her so you could

229
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,690
theoretically use the IMF needs to pick
up as you go to these conferences people

230
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,230
are handed out patches and a lot of
these badges have built in radio chips

231
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:36,850
that this is the the next hope 12 it has
an error after 24 hello one built on and

232
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,120
I like you do blue cheese so again
you're looking at various Deb kids that

233
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:50,049
could enable use an attacker or FCAT is
something I mentioned previously it's a

234
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:56,580
real popular subject heard sure or lower
radio talk show in you can make use of

235
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:02,000
it from a variety of hardware platforms
ti Curtis watch makes use the equipment

236
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,940
so you could make an application or on
your watch that might help you identify

237
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,700
around also that the standard way you
doin it was the ENK dongle which is

238
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,789
Dawn's dongle that was the original or
ask at Bice now my Crosman has the

239
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:26,210
yardstick one kind of a refined version
of that initially produced one also from

240
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,490
my casa minha something you could make
you say this is a 2.4 gigahertz radio

241
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,799
system so keep in mind the lot of the
modern systems are making us 2.4

242
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,010
gigahertz could use that to sync up with
the spectrum radio or something along

243
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,740
those lines

244
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,590
now the other thing you can do is you
can take the vendors hardware and use it

245
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,420
against them and that's one of the
things that mike has done for the stalks

246
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,700
him brush up on that a little bit yes I
will talk about taking the firmware that

247
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:05,490
was used in robotics radios and using
that the takeover another brownie you're

248
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,230
not supposed to be connected to by
connecting in figuring out their

249
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,480
frequency hopping spread spectrum and it
doesn't actually identify the NetID

250
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,940
which will talk about a little bit more
later but that's the only way to secure

251
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:25,740
communication system video Myke making
use of the new radio toolkit with one of

252
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,770
the random software-defined radios and
he's using it to pick up the hopping

253
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,530
sequence on a spectrum radio so when it
launches you're basically see

254
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:41,840
visualization and that's the first step
in beginning to start attacking radio so

255
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,700
you can see where the channels actually
are within a dallas you could figure out

256
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,140
what the pattern is that not keep in
mind that the r/c system so you have to

257
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,340
figure out how to connect there's a
unique identifier as well that's on the

258
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,240
chip and then trying to figure out how
to take control

259
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,400
this is an example of shopping for the
telemetry radios lot simpler there's

260
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,850
only a few channels mean utilize at 14
any radio in once you're connected you

261
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:16,580
have the ability to programmatically
change what so again

262
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,850
circling back to what's inside a lot of
this equipment it's all comments RSS

263
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,690
circuit so things that are applicable in
the community in our clickable for

264
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,620
Drew's it's nothing new chip kahn radio
interface find it all over the place

265
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,400
somebody mentioned smaller toyed rooms
in the audience in the same Icom

266
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,580
final water those toys to take apart the
RadioShack stuff the things a lot of

267
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,860
people give out Christmas toys know some
hundred dollar range rooms and whatnot

268
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:54,660
this is the bigger than their cypress is
another popular vendor you've probably

269
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,120
seen them for in the USB space they make
USB serial adapter which is a lot of

270
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,540
equipment so spectrum is evander is
especially used this wireless USB

271
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:11,100
chipset to transmit data to the terms
Nordic see me again we've seen a stop

272
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,090
before in the communities same stuff
that was in the New Hope badge so again

273
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,510
obviously the vendors are using it for
their communication you have one in New

274
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:26,110
Hope bad you're probably pretty tribute
to figure out of deviation is an

275
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:32,720
open-source radio firmware for the Evo
seven years in a couple other radios

276
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,750
that are out there essentially what you
can do is take a lot of these chips they

277
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,260
shoot you in the previous slides in
embed them into this transmitter and the

278
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:48,150
open-source give you the ability to try
parade and subsequently talk to think so

279
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,920
in in my opinion this is almost perfect
attack platform if you want to get into

280
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:59,130
developing your own attack radio system
for RCA jacks it really is because we

281
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,180
already know from the commute from the
open source software

282
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:10,310
legitimately use its you control what
you can do for that is actually go back

283
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:16,960
and look at how the protected and try to
figure out ways to attack it so it will

284
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,650
probably do it also lot of the
information we need to figure it out

285
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:28,100
because a lot of rain of people to just
meet pledges deviation to do ms jackson

286
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,940
you know there's another platform out
from one bit squared which is

287
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,049
a member of the paparazzi project was
popular out of auto pilot project in

288
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:44,919
they create a Cyprus CY our effort he is
said he did you mean the middle attacks

289
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,840
so you can in essence pick this up and
utilize it as your platform for

290
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,019
attacking

291
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:59,769
just three are specific stuff now to
start with the legacy Dr products which

292
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:06,899
are therefore 33 radio is they utilize
some called mapping and sampling is a

293
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:11,980
generic cereal overlying serial protocol
that allows commands that are defined

294
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,110
within the Maverick vertical ground
station which is usually computer in the

295
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:22,809
drug itself as you command says way
points for all in all kinds of stuff is

296
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:28,610
used by number different vendors
everything that he met a three yard line

297
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:35,490
and all this is basically what is
generic cereal package looks like a

298
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:41,379
lawyer is one might have heard the old
version warez links link fight as a

299
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:45,440
sequence by which I just increments so
that it knows when it loses a packet

300
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,840
system and component IDs are usually
just one you don't have to authenticate

301
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,549
the payload itself is really just the
command at the mapping command did you

302
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:07,210
code it and so the whole protocol has
been a problem for the project for quite

303
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,340
a while and I think this developer John
Burton really framed it quite well in in

304
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,159
calling cat-and-mouse game for the
project and that the thing is is

305
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,549
genuinely that it's not something that
they really care about they look at

306
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:25,700
their their project as a hobby grade
project the interesting thing about that

307
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,899
for me is the fact that they are now
pushing industrial products and consumer

308
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:35,659
products available to the masses so you
can step out of that hey we're just a

309
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:40,500
hobby project in my opinion so this is
really been a hot topic across a variety

310
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,090
of the RAF links

311
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,980
this project is used originally they
used to make you see connectivity and

312
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,549
they would recommend that you set the
encryption bit 00 not was because they

313
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:58,020
were bandwidth in my opinion the
bandwidth concerns are probably a little

314
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:06,130
lessons concerns so this in essence you
know there's a large swath a swatch take

315
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:11,400
its toll on his slide large swath of
impact in the in the legacy product line

316
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,929
43 er the current product line you know
before that the smart stuff with solo

317
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:27,010
his meet you should this this hope Aref
line in there came out last year they

318
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:34,480
had to Iris and even the virus uses same
radios 63 remarks that I can say right

319
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,779
now that there's very little room to
grow at these products the firmware is

320
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:46,240
basically using all memory space
available for CRF model and all they do

321
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,340
these six model hope our effort they put
it on 24 that cereal and so it's

322
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,159
literally they're just clear text
passing their their protocol through the

323
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:04,320
air with 80 support for encryption at
the hardware level additionally the

324
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,720
Madelung protocol itself was never
designed with security in mind so a

325
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,789
number of people have started noticing
there are vulnerabilities and if you

326
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:20,470
look at this research paper which is
really a little talk about the ability

327
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,149
to take over

328
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:28,710
listening and also actively attacking
its always here for map radio and he's

329
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,940
got in here so analysis about packet
losses are to help you figure that out

330
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,500
and we've actually experienced that in
our testing but the this is a really

331
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:44,029
good overview of but again the main
point here is that this is a military

332
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:49,710
military's interested in your toys

333
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,620
toys a lot of the stuff just really
hasn't been discussed publicly I don't

334
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,950
know if it's because there's people that
are doing it or they're just you been to

335
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:03,960
themselves but one of those few people
is it rooted Khan in 2012 he discussed

336
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,120
the nuances found in map in one of those
nuances was in the serialization in how

337
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,149
they handle blanks viciously than a
standard buffer overflow that he was

338
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:19,870
able to explain it in this platform what
that means you could for example do you

339
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:25,409
know and ROP payload payload end to your
craft return to home but instead of

340
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:30,880
return to home for the pilot he said it
to your address your car so you click

341
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:38,809
the link and tell somebody there there's
again very few people talking about how

342
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:45,190
to hijack prunes and this is Matt hacker
dot org is one of the small handful I

343
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,620
count on a couple of fingers and I he
not specifically that in 3d our land

344
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:58,500
that the NetID is the only things really
protecting you from being used to it is

345
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,190
seated in the SRAM function and see
everybody is that it generates this

346
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,309
channel pattern and it's likely to this
channel matter but it isn't it's used to

347
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:13,270
generate a base frequency so that every
channel is based off of that initial

348
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,700
frequency but take the very absolute
minimum frequency and they had the space

349
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:22,750
frequency that you need to know both of
those needs to be able to sync up so

350
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,090
over the years

351
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,770
a secure map link implementations come
up a number of times you look at the

352
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:34,029
date on this paper its its 2013 in it
it's pretty clear at this point there's

353
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:44,409
no widespread usage of secure map
Lincoln site is pretty clear but

354
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,090
fortunately people keep beating a dead
horse in dinner not really reading into

355
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,850
it so witness digital specifically hear
that the way to solve it

356
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:58,230
is to use a better faster chip the one
that seemed footprint and actually has a

357
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,850
built-in we've known this for a number
of years but again the conversation

358
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,210
keeps coming up here in RSC it's moving
towards securing babbling and they

359
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,540
talked about the streaks on in how we
can make babbling secure and again they

360
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,260
came back to the fact that hey this is
at No processor that's driving

361
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,380
everything just can't do it never going
to do it

362
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,890
couple of people that have come up with
a cash workarounds if you will

363
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,060
this is the Syria airlift product
project what they do is they are

364
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:36,490
delivering humanitarian aid conflicts
using art to pilot software in they

365
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:42,680
become up with quote security handshake
which I don't put much faith in invasive

366
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,650
with a plane does he have a custom
handshake between the plane on the

367
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:51,280
ground control station that allows you
to sync up pretty much already

368
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:57,620
determined it is really trivial to sniff
that stuff so it's not you know another

369
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,030
person in that same line of thought is
this Matt hacker gentleman he's released

370
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:08,510
crypto 20 metres from where the fun
thing about his though it is

371
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,660
blakely mentions sources not open the
secrets are permanently stored inside

372
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,040
inhibiting the source will give the
values of give clues of possible attack

373
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,230
vectors

374
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:25,710
like whatever you do you seriously want
to pay 75 bucks for this so you again

375
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,290
I'm going to continue beating a dead
horse at range the main 3d robotics

376
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:35,650
Developer November this this past year
came up and said hey guys really the

377
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:41,570
right thing to do is to buy the proper
radio this supports the so it's a gold

378
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:48,390
star we've been saying this for years
now as far as an actual takeover of a

379
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,760
flight using this protocol needs these
unencrypted radios there there's a set

380
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,700
of mechanics that go along with it

381
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,350
working with 3d are specific equipment
and all that

382
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:04,350
yes everything again every craft is
different but with this website again he

383
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,789
talks about doing a flight termination
he talks about turning off the drones

384
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:12,880
ability to send packets back the ground
seasons that way the person who really

385
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,120
supposed to be calling the Dr doesn't
know the change the flight mode doesn't

386
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,580
know that you've set a waypoint or
anything like that and that's what he's

387
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,160
getting into is doing it if I
termination or selling points but it's

388
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,010
all very sure to craft and talk about
the days really was we did termination

389
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:39,240
actually implement its Wii controller
back to the soloist and I'm really

390
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:51,350
disappointed I'm not here in this thing
like this city and it has a standard WPA

391
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,320
wi-fi connection it's up and running
right now so there's there's telemetry

392
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:02,190
going back its GPS down its yeah there
is it it's not for 33 telemetry though

393
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:08,020
so again if i if I said kismet near
crack would own this thing you probably

394
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,379
not believe me but that actually saw 3d
are marketed this thing is a secure wifi

395
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:19,429
link as far as the the control system
call it solo link it's literally nothing

396
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:25,119
more than a host EPD implementation
running WPA in the Quick Start Guide

397
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,230
they tell everybody to use default
password which is so link if you reset

398
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:35,060
the equipment it's always so link and
they never tell you to change so I know

399
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:45,840
there's a lot of people to still have it
said his solo yes yes you are so kiss me

400
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,159
again

401
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,050
think you're going to know if we put a
lot of hard work into kids minutes it's

402
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:56,429
still useful just after you can do with
it

403
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:02,099
so really to me I think it's kind of
funny that they're selling the singer's

404
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,680
equipped smart room but it's not even
really smart enough to protect the

405
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,630
control and not seeing the video 211 w
is the end all be all on wi-fi security

406
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:15,280
but at the very least you could have
prevented me from the authenticating the

407
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,589
drone flying so again if circle back
that you s open incident anybody in the

408
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:26,010
room with a cell phone to stop that drew
from entering that airspace it was

409
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:34,500
released it was again i three years and
knocked in a demo WPA cracking that's

410
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,910
been in our community for quite a while
now is nothing special so same thing

411
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:47,460
with the Dr attack anybody in Tripoli
Tripoli but again the meeting is once

412
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:58,740
you've done that you're more or less
you're on the air is now and the caveat

413
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,630
here is I'm not gonna fly this thing you
don't really see that I'm not trying to

414
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:12,799
pay for new hospital bills additionally
number of folks that have talked lately

415
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:15,820
that if used a yard roone

416
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:21,040
their attack platform so i'm i'm not
gonna do this either anybody can telnet

417
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,820
into an open wifi Lincoln subsequently
you know it's worth looking through

418
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:35,380
these but these are basically common
videos that have been out the simi

419
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,510
call them out on it was a yard rooms
firmware that would spread to other

420
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,760
aired runes I thought it was kind of
funny because I've never seen more than

421
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,270
one AR Drone in like you know two or
three years time collectively celinda

422
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,910
how this thing is going to spread but
whatever it again this just just just

423
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:59,460
popped up it def con this past month or
so just against somebody tell me this is

424
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:05,330
a really spectacular so I'mma let Mike
talked about his firmware told sickening

425
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:13,930
attack platform for the three Dr 433 so
it's open source firmware that they use

426
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:19,130
on these hope Aref Aref models that are
in the areas that are on board the drone

427
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:24,680
in your computer the station and what
I've done is basically taken the

428
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,850
firmware in change how it and how it
initializes so that it basically hops

429
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,700
through the different frequencies

430
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,850
different channels in tries to identify
a goal in could have her and when it

431
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,190
does that then I'm able to extract
information that would let me figure out

432
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:44,370
what the net ideas once we do that then
we reanalyzed the radio with the correct

433
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:52,430
NetID and over on the correct frequency
hopping order and so this is just some

434
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:57,300
screenshots I sent him on Twitter where
I had said the NetID on my attackers

435
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,589
radio 247

436
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:04,450
and then plugged in with the drones
active around as well in at record

437
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:11,589
forgot the 1925 which is the fall and
then this is a screenshot of what we

438
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,489
talked about maybe she could terminate
command of adding that into something

439
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:20,960
like map proxy so that you can use a
proxy to connects to your radio and he

440
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,779
sees terminal commands with the caveat
here is that crashed has actually

441
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:29,229
supported which the stable version of
our discovery that I had done so in

442
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:35,890
essence what what he's been able to do
is take a rogue radio and forced to join

443
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,940
the network

444
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,479
treated himself as a road ETA on this
network in from there he can send

445
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:45,589
commands to the other in because there's
no authentication when you're part of

446
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:50,869
the network can just packets out so he's
in essence you know connecting the

447
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:54,559
protocol hand or on the back into the
drone and just telling you what to do

448
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:00,769
the only caveat that we've run into is
there some collisions and regional in

449
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:04,489
your rogue station which is why the
other gentleman the mat hacker was

450
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:10,390
discussing how to prevent the nation
from replying back to you in making the

451
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:16,749
environment conducive to research paper
that we had a little while back he talks

452
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:20,619
about interference in a lot of packet
loss and that's one thing we experienced

453
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:24,430
the other issues like the radio within
like three feet of each other so

454
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:30,869
basically what I'm doing is showing it
playing in the radio with sickening on

455
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,469
it and setting the NetID you're showing
the 909 ideas not correct which the

456
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:39,049
correct that idea in this case of leaves
for 75 but I'm just sitting at the depot

457
00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:47,960
which then I unplug it and show the
corrects radio its ideas

458
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,599
and then what's going to happen
basically is fired up ten like flying

459
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:58,390
watch it with a with the transmitter
here and then plug in the device causing

460
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:02,820
it to basically stopped all members of
the speakers turned up you can hear he's

461
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,450
got the throttle cranked up and you know
when they're in the reboot is injected

462
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:15,300
the throttle stop so obviously I already
tweeted the slides this link on my

463
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:22,200
Twitter account its . / Celaya see so
you guys can these videos and you're in

464
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:29,880
your own time this is just like an
example of something you could maybe

465
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,800
have it do if you took over this video
is gonna pull down for whatever reason

466
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,619
but basically one of the things that we
mention you could you random art copters

467
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,710
user on bench working with their
equipment if you want to be a jerk

468
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:57,400
bank sticks around Michael most drove
himself with it so back to the soloist

469
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,160
cell again I mention they're using
Android tablets in in iOS tablets for

470
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,960
the for the control plots or so we all
know what happens with the injury doubts

471
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:14,670
you can take a part of you that you so
gene Teague either at you see all kinds

472
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:19,950
of fun stuff and it's it's real tribute
to figure out what to do with it

473
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:25,030
the root password is in there in in
plain text yes each address is there the

474
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:33,430
SCG user name is there everything is
real problems there clearly the funding

475
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,690
about this is though even though you
have the password if you change dinner

476
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,720
to fix the hard could pass for TWO the
app doesn't matter because the way

477
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,730
they've written everything there's a
bunch of an authenticator particles

478
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:51,440
flying all over the solo basically so
there's a lot of back in architectural

479
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,079
work to do to make this secure a robust

480
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:03,670
so in insider that source code there's a
couple of tokens can borrow and you look

481
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:08,660
at some things with one of those tokens
for their flight training school which

482
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:15,140
tells you you know how to unlock see
fanshots and spectacular both of their

483
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:21,140
firmware download channels are there so
the injury that makes a request to JSON

484
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,059
response comes back

485
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:27,400
pulls out at RGC file which think it's
written to the Dragoon and onto the

486
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,180
aircraft the only thing verifying his
five hits in need the JSON comes down so

487
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,440
if you wanted to smooth out for example
it's pretty trivial to tell it hate

488
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,150
download this file / they also had a
Weather Underground API key in there

489
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,289
which with Weather Underground all you
need do is use that epi ki in the euro

490
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:52,690
and you're making your queries so thanks
for that I appreciate that this is the

491
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:59,920
weather for whatever arafat
presentations they also have a solo beta

492
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,579
program which I'm an official member of
your supposed to sign up in get access

493
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:12,119
to their apt and whatnot but again it
uses the API keys that I mentioned the

494
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,229
source code you can just make the
queries on your own stuff down so kind

495
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:20,829
of notes in there that are more
developer centric they don't think they

496
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:24,049
particularly care for her but didn't
know there's one in here mentioning

497
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:28,079
specifically some poor white higher
performance that was causing short-range

498
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:43,720
return to launches hundred feet out your
practice she's a very annoying it

499
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:51,220
inside the firmware which is basically
towards you see with squash and it

500
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:55,849
didn't even modify the squash invest a
lot of the routers like a bit somewhere

501
00:43:55,849 --> 00:44:00,570
mess up the gzip routine and it's really
annoying dog compresses just straight up

502
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:07,840
regular squash that so mounted up then
you got access to the file system you

503
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,980
get all of their logic for making the
sting smart as words so the funny thing

504
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:17,820
about that is in a lot of their scripts
which are all just Python they made the

505
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:23,790
mistake of embedding document links to
their internal developers and they've

506
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,700
done this like 45 release in a row and
i'd I'm amount every time I don't know

507
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:34,710
why they so this is a confidential
document on Google 40 bus that they were

508
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,910
supposed to be the exclusive vendors I
don't think they carried by published

509
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:47,290
that is now it's a hidden documenting in
but again there so on the wireless link

510
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:53,339
specifically mixed fuel as one of the
lead engineers 3 robotics project in

511
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:57,060
about a month and a half after I reached
big stink about them not telling users

512
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:04,070
changed password somebody finally comes
out so in his opinion you can't do any

513
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:10,109
harm if it changed password in I'm not
going to beat semantics around cracking

514
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:14,869
passwords I know some guys really good
it figuring the trivial things

515
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:22,170
words additionally I know a number you
guys are particularly good it crackin

516
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,620
passwords and whatnot so I'd be flat out
lying if I told you I didn't download

517
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:32,210
the church's wifi stuff and creating an
Amazon ec2 instance I think I asked you

518
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:40,850
a question here and there so basically I
bought the was the g2x larger tests for

519
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:48,920
GPUs in it and there's no 1536 course
inside each GPU which calculates out to

520
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:55,640
a metric ton of course I apologize so
basically my invoice for two days with

521
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,410
the cracking as 25 bucks so it's like
okay that's a no-brainer that generates

522
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,390
rainbow tables

523
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:12,190
there's basically a finite number of a
societies that are fall if you will most

524
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:18,130
of these users are never gonna cheat you
know Lincoln so I just went ahead and

525
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,529
general ed Balls for those I went down
here Ashley Madison passwords and all

526
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:27,680
the other top ten thousand leaks and all
that in you know there are some that are

527
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:35,170
not valid WPA password but those were my
WP table and but again I'm not that

528
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:40,329
that's not my arena so I'm not sure how
well that works does it mean playing

529
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:50,079
which Papa solo link so this is a video
of me this is the first time that I got

530
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,410
comfortable enough to try to fly the
solo from my laptop

531
00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:01,849
basically a written expect script to
connect to the wifi SSH into the

532
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:10,980
platform connects to the map Roxanne's
local can I uploaded a script in its

533
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:20,589
takeoff but there were some folks in the
field I was flying in and I was really

534
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:23,470
uncomfortable with it but I went ahead
and did it anyway

535
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:31,509
in the in essence it up in the air takes
off it's literally hovering over these

536
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:36,619
guys are playing soccer in the air but
again the main point was that I was able

537
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:44,220
to use my laptop to commandeer the solar
link so again

538
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:50,920
eyeballing it is nothing really
spectacular just run around it you can't

539
00:47:50,920 --> 00:48:01,109
pop solo linked to trash so against a
video me I mean if your cross streets

540
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:10,800
same yield on the solo flash down so

541
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:19,180
in essence fire fair crack til it's over
and over and over as soon as idiotic

542
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:25,690
packets hit the craft immediately starts
flashing light repair the flash and

543
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:30,390
written back in forests I have my hands
are not on the transmitters would have

544
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:35,460
shown you there and it's coming back to
be so again at the USO open just SAT

545
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,320
there D off all day long

546
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,480
that's a little too never even taken off
so it's extremely true beauty impact the

547
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,000
quality of the solo Lincoln prevent
somebody from flying so maybe next year

548
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,270
olds argument change your password and
nobody can do anything whatever so when

549
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:57,960
these things first came out I didn't own
one and I had a friend of mine that

550
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:05,940
actually lives in Texas close to 13 Dr
offices and I had him go down to where

551
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:10,180
they do a lot of their marketing videos
show everybody how their new product is

552
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,240
he sought out there with his laptop and
kiss me a couple people flying their

553
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:23,570
brand new solos so they are extremely
extremely tribute to find identified by

554
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,680
their MAC address a number of other
things I might try to move through here

555
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,840
quickly cuz we're chillin through time
do this stuff so turn this thing down

556
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:37,250
again there are some benefits doing it I
tapped on to all of the pins I saw

557
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,500
internally and I thought you are which I
found it very useful to move that you

558
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:46,990
aren't external now I can to shell out
on the controller anytime I want to it's

559
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,600
kinda like the equivalent of
jailbreaking phone I guess if you wanna

560
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,360
come up with an analogy this thing is
basically a Freescale I am x6 I now know

561
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,930
everything about it I bought my own mx6
development platform pretty much closed

562
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,300
it I can additionally modify the clues
but state not shared is the firmware

563
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,150
that actually gets pushed onto the
screen so when it boots that are seeing

564
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,230
waiting for solo i changes Hampshire
wake up real trouble you can also see

565
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,440
I've gotta move my sdcard external
because I got sick you take anything

566
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,059
apart

567
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:21,479
I want to do whatever I wanted to so
what can we do with access to the

568
00:50:21,479 --> 00:50:25,839
transmitter a lot of people were asking
is it possible to use transmitter with

569
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,859
other drugs and developers in the vendor
came back and said no that's that's not

570
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:38,359
completely legit so I live stream it's
basically a call in essence what I found

571
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:45,789
was that if I used Gabby its real
tribute in essence also found some code

572
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:50,130
on on the file system that allowed
needed a short cut my development work

573
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,229
by utilizing there could you pick the
factor structure parts so it's literally

574
00:50:54,229 --> 00:51:00,529
timestamp sequence I T in the PWM
channels so you can inject anything

575
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:06,869
connected to somebody's transmitter
turned off prevent them from accessing

576
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:12,009
it so again this is just a Linux box I
can cut you out of it anytime I want to

577
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:13,799
do about it

578
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:19,349
likewise I can take control of your
flying it don't have any control of it

579
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:25,289
it's cool I gotcha I got it back in my
house now so for me the Holy Grail in

580
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:30,089
this is again reading the Linux instance
running scripts locally or just

581
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:34,079
generically using the fact a proxy
instance is not authenticated through

582
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:40,449
three trad is sickening case to the
screenshot here is actually might taking

583
00:51:40,449 --> 00:51:42,609
advantage sickening issue

584
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:46,799
yeah this is basically here about two
different instances wanted to be in a

585
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:49,959
training mission planning on my Mac
they're connected with two different

586
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:53,509
radio is known as the sickening radio
it's connected but they're both

587
00:51:53,509 --> 00:52:01,349
connected to the drug issue commands are
both getting back so again I I suggest

588
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:06,199
you abused your buttocks user's
knowledge the best way I can think of

589
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:12,270
doing that is drawing some Europeans and
I you figure out that is if you saw

590
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:16,450
the NASA rover there's been many great
before me in the European arina

591
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:23,800
accidentally drew that would ever do so
again this was a Gizmodo a couple years

592
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,350
back that you did this with his
airplanes apparently the hero that we

593
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:35,820
needed so I want to be here you to this
is a subpar you know drawing from 2013

594
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:40,490
Christian Andersen the CEO of 3d
robotics to canada beat this dead horse

595
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:48,840
went out and went to a local high school
in fourteen year olds why is apparently

596
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,770
the first thing they thought to do it

597
00:52:51,770 --> 00:53:00,960
so again my rendition of this I
basically took took a star pattern will

598
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,570
call it a search-and-rescue pattern in
III transpose it on my local location in

599
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:12,330
a piece of code that I can go anywhere
else in the world in Sac seem polygon

600
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:20,760
wherever I was so as you can see here
I've taken my hair P did track and field

601
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,870
so it was with some code by gentleman
called a distance into you and he wrote

602
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,640
a paper called direct and inverse
solutions dude Essex on the ellipsoid

603
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:35,320
with application in this setup equations
and I basically took his final matlab

604
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:41,590
script in proper python which then works
with drums so basically all that

605
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:50,530
together the algorithm allows me to you
know so again as far as all this goes to

606
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:56,430
obviously some of the trolling so what a
proper truly be without such as I

607
00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:02,610
mentioned before your flight school
application to fly and I replaced all to

608
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:14,480
be used with whatever I want in this
case all of flight side video was all

609
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,840
GStreamer so this stuff is pretty
trivial to interface with 32 yards come

610
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,720
out and give you a proper GStreamer
pipeline to do this but couple months

611
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,400
back there are hiding in all they were
telling you so my techniques for more

612
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,280
back-alley street scene with the
password they weren't given it to you

613
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,710
before but now they're sharing and being
more open heard partially because so

614
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,540
again the main point video stream is
attributed to sniff redirect inject

615
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,160
replace me

616
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,830
redirecting the packets off the radio to
my computer and then playing a lot of

617
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:54,020
tools that enable that video jack is one
UDP reflectors a specific way I did it

618
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:58,980
by redirecting the UDP port to my IP
when I was joined at the social network

619
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,500
additionally you started P break which
if you just sniff the traffic you can

620
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:09,420
run RTP break against him spit out movie
files of the media session comes on Cali

621
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:16,590
Linux and the last bit of that is again
on the user's tablet you can inject that

622
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:21,680
seemed GStreamer imagery back onto their
tablet where they're using fresh so I

623
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,530
don't actually have the stream up and
running but you see the GStreamer test

624
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:31,770
for you / really quickly that's that
multi-colored there so that's me

625
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:36,380
injecting that on the wifi likes of you
were flying you should be seeing the

626
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,920
video feed out of the room but I can
actually push over top of it again I can

627
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,450
push the video if they're really wanted
to do so

628
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:48,690
one of the last things to discuss is
compiling and three are really doesn't

629
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:53,290
want you to do that they mentioned
specifically it's not supported in their

630
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:57,980
new development guy I found some ways
around that you can just take squash

631
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,990
effects image to read into it and then
use a tissue development platform whole

632
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:07,640
thing is based off the octal and hex
lock to Linux point out the point 51

633
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,440
rpms and basically creature in
development I created a depth Odyssey

634
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:18,820
each trip which takes all the necessary
rpms I also compiled a number of

635
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:22,859
binaries which are kinda useful for
people that are hacking on this platform

636
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:24,640
they're all available I get home

637
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,240
currently private I'll flip it open
after the talk is over again you get

638
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:34,710
things like ashtrays GB all the stuff
you need one of the first things I

639
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:39,630
compiled was packs test which would help
me determine what they did with regards

640
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,190
to randomization the kernel memory
addresses and what not to see from the

641
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:49,220
output Dr did nothing so you know when
you find exploitation point it's pretty

642
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:55,540
trivial to go through it and have a lot
of fun so again this stuff is basically

643
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:01,980
logic blocks as far as I'm concerned you
can mix and match gather some you guys

644
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,090
have been traveling adventure on things
took me awhile but I got him to finally

645
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:10,240
abide by TPL sold the kernel source
everything else out there

646
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,920
get out maybe make a pre-owned former
image when their controllers tried to

647
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,750
talk to the journey but again there's a
lot of traditional exploitable

648
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:25,290
vulnerabilities out there also Mike
history even at the RAF interface is

649
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:29,790
also something you PUC don't forget
about the legacy products lot of options

650
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:34,070
lost your password cracking you might
have to use of logic like Prince

651
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:39,830
preprocessor your wp tables you but
again when she done that he finally

652
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:44,510
locked the end user out maybe rick roll
them stream the video excuse circle

653
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:49,050
around them are you record them in your
kind of talk them a little bit and then

654
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:55,730
draw Skype home or you just be a jerk
catch salon on the bench like we should

655
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,750
with Mike she can just turn on throttle
it up and it might wind up killing

656
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,400
someone in the face which is probably
bad things so again watch the current

657
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,500
chap fun so that's all we've got

658
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:12,119
and on that note I'm just gonna leave
this idea and you guys have any

659
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,410
questions I just know I think we're well
over time
