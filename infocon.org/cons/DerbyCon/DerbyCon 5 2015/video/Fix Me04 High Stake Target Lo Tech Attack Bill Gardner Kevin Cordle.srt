1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
happen once they're my toy story

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:34,440
cyber apt in the pile and on the web
metrics my drinks among my no pressure

3
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:42,600
pressure so we're here to talk about
power grid and this is our talk with

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,690
Prime Outlets hack attacks we talked
about how you take down the power grid

5
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:54,460
with Doug change screwdriver and mylar
balloons first of all while Marshall

6
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,989
University is where we are from we have
to put this disclaimer so we don't get

7
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:07,310
fired back so I'm not sure what that's
doing in there so I'm a professor at

8
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:14,030
Marshall University and I teach kids
about hackers stuff and author comes out

9
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:21,689
in November you can get it for pre-order
there is a discount code in your bag is

10
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:30,439
my CCDC team who have horribly failed
during fires every year for two years in

11
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,400
a row this is what we call public
shaming

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,640
here for hackers for charity

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,300
OC johnnie in the booth there is a lot
of money forum john is a good dude and

14
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,020
hosts a podcast come free food at trying
to get prime c'mon

15
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,300
hikers shot up crimes in the house you
think there's anyone else here with a

16
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,480
handle that anyway

17
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,870
captain sexy

18
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:19,110
my URL is rebooted podcast I can't
that's not gonna get that and I have

19
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,709
really bad names these are actual
extracts of money so if i start the

20
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,520
waiver sat down that's what's going on
any new replacements of taking up

21
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:39,430
collection after this so I and my name
is Kevin Corley who call me Kevin

22
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,739
retired early from the power company I'm
a 24 year veteran our theory as a

23
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:54,560
lineman and there is service restore I
am currently a criminal justice major I

24
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,440
did like and currently a criminal
justice graduate student studying

25
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:08,709
studying with my emphasis in law
graduate in December of 2016 thank you

26
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:16,600
about something that's me in the picture
as a long story that goes with that but

27
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,370
I'm cutting 7,200 votes at 60 amps and
it wasn't a good idea very ill conceived

28
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,770
at the time

29
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,600
and what happened was there was a
massive storm at the park and County

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:38,900
West Virginia and 1998 and December 14
AP as a Service restore and there was a

31
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,250
line down across the fence and it was
burning 7,200 votes there were two

32
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:51,030
people chasing a horse around the four
foot of snow and they were very fit and

33
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,150
their kids were run along behind them in
pyjamas and barefooted screaming mommy

34
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,790
mommy daddy daddy the horses are going
to die when I had to agree with them

35
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:10,940
actually when I pulled up there was a
metal fence on fire was really cute and

36
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,710
all the fans president like birthday
candles and that's what happened with

37
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:23,740
the unfortunately the press was there
also and they got a picture of me in

38
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,770
that wire was didn't bode well for me
later on in the safety meeting that I

39
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:35,190
had to preside over the only alternative
was let them as we first thought I

40
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,650
wasn't gonna do that what I'm hearing
had my point is here people lose their

41
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:48,940
mad when the power goes out and after
they lose her man they sue everybody

42
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,770
including me

43
00:04:51,770 --> 00:05:03,110
basics right now I worked hurricane hugo
in 1999 I worked several other lesser

44
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,689
storms but every time that I worked a
storm

45
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:11,489
with the power company for service
restoration that lasted over 24 hours

46
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:18,329
people just went crazy I've been shot at
being called names that I still can't

47
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:26,679
find on the internet and true story I
have seen the National Guard set up at

48
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:33,159
Walmart and Piggly Wiggly with a fifty
caliber machine gun I don't know what

49
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:39,110
she wanted and then you're right the
point is this is what happens when the

50
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:48,209
power goes sound and it doesn't take
long for this start to happen you want

51
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:56,869
to talk about squirrels they're not
telling jurors hear eyewitness

52
00:05:56,869 --> 00:06:07,299
protection program so weird 50% power
outages are actually from squirrels we

53
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:13,949
know that people in the industry of talk
about that but beyond squirrels which

54
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,139
are pretty low-tech if you could train a
squirrel we were talking about beyond

55
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,409
squirrels with the other things that are
low-tech threats against the power

56
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:26,399
system and you haven't talked about some
of the things they've done to try to

57
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,569
deter smoke has every service restores
for the power company this is true every

58
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,879
time that the power goes out every 1
I've been here is probably wait a few

59
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,979
minutes to say hi

60
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:45,899
most of the time it is and there's a
device that I used to install on the

61
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,149
primary business of Transformers conduct
Corona ring that's really not something

62
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:57,659
you have to go to the sex shop and buy
it's a plastic ring that has metal

63
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:03,699
outside it and it's really close to the
transformer and without that corollary 1

64
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:08,919
there he just grabbed the Lawrence
family refuses to butt with a car during

65
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:19,210
our creates charges so what happens is
gets blown clean off the transform

66
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:35,099
and it's really cool to power outage and
the public service keeps records of all

67
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,220
the couches and spend down to individual
specialists are complaining she followed

68
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,039
me out of a drive is a wanted you could
add up there and I told her what it did

69
00:07:44,039 --> 00:08:50,340
I said Wow

70
00:08:50,340 --> 00:09:19,250
the big astronaut when we used to be
able to get back to the squirrel see

71
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:34,870
that's about it but the point of that is
we do the power company does do things

72
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,170
to try to mitigate these circumstances
these things that cause power outages

73
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:47,940
I'm gonna talk about today some things
things that worry me about the physical

74
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:59,710
vulnerability and when I first started
this talk of her story this idea became

75
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:06,000
between bill and I was worried about
middle eastern terrorists and anybody

76
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,680
else like that but as I gonna get into
this more and more worried about

77
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:17,680
homegrown terrorism and I think that
that's becoming a definite about the

78
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:33,690
people that know how to do this so don't
do this around we had a dress rehearsal

79
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:41,760
for this in 2012 July 29 2012 to ratio
who threw it to ratio some sort of like

80
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:50,900
the new asylum Taco Bell doesn't now
this week only did the ratio so we had

81
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:58,700
winds in excess of 450 miles an hour and
six hours that swept from Chicago

82
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,230
through West Virginia and West Virginia
there were places who had

83
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:09,670
our power for extended amounts of time
on total three point four million

84
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,490
households lost power so those
households had power for very long

85
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,650
periods of time so this is what it
looked like before during the duration

86
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:24,240
show this is what it looked like after
dinner issue so you see it pretty hard

87
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:36,050
power hit in some cases it took more
than a week to get back online at

88
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:42,090
Ridgewood West Virginia was offline for
a week which meant the water system

89
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,520
didn't work

90
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,240
sewer system had issues and people who
needed medical devices in order to stay

91
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,350
alive had to be transported to places
with power we also have an issue with

92
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,940
the age of the infrastructure which I
think Kevin's gonna talk about later

93
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,460
some of the stuff dates back to nineteen
thirties some of it dates back to

94
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,860
nineteen twenties and it is still in
service this is a power pole near

95
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:19,430
Marshall University so what do you think
this is 33 the cross arms are from

96
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:30,899
nineteen twenties so so if we don't have
power to make coffee

97
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:39,059
for those of us who work patent have to
use CPAP machines with hammer CPAP

98
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:47,329
machines which isn't that big of a deal
right on about your data sooner in your

99
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:52,050
own a datacenter without power if you
can I would talk to you because I want

100
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,249
to patent that idea because we'll be
busy and there's yes data centers have

101
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:00,850
battery backups but if you're in a
situation where you have an extended

102
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:07,509
period of time where you're down it's
it's it's just not a good situation so

103
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:14,379
the other dress rehearsal we have for
this was remember to Trina 2005 and in

104
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:19,160
this case we had power outages that
lasted for weeks in some cases a month

105
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,959
and a half and we said some very deadly
results

106
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,009
hospitals that were packed infected like
this sorry to have to make decisions

107
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,809
about you lived and who look who died

108
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:38,269
based upon amount of power and they had
because they were stranded so now I mean

109
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:47,949
everyone you're happy I haven't talked
about the abilities consultations grid

110
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:57,600
operates independently failure in 10
replies in other areas that is really

111
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:08,639
what I'm gonna tell you what that means
whenever the power goes out what happens

112
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,299
is house or are called circular feeds
which means they can feed from one way

113
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:18,740
to the other way in a circle which means
they can isolate the fault of their

114
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,079
phone as isolated they can go to a
switching point may not be your power

115
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,170
your power i think im gonna switching
point and pick the substations back what

116
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:34,209
happens in an attack is if they hit both
sides what happens in extended outages

117
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:38,699
they hear both sides of this with you
it's not a hard thing to figure out

118
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:44,249
where those people driving down the road
like you guys are very observant you'll

119
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:48,179
see these big things that go up the pole
and you'll see those things on top of

120
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:53,350
the poll you know that's just a normal
poll has a swisha structure so if you

121
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,509
get a couple miles back come from miles
forward we can't turn the power around

122
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:04,819
so what happens is you have a cascading
help college type situation what happens

123
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:12,470
also during these attacks are ordering
the during these outages when multiple

124
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:18,299
trees fall through the lines is we don't
we don't people would chase you down and

125
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:24,999
say wow wow I'm sure you guys have
thought that they must raise got power

126
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:35,199
whatsoever because of the switching and
the rally and because your Transformer

127
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,129
that you see on your house may not
feature you so you don't really know

128
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:45,290
what I'm talking about here is people
it's not hard to figure out what's going

129
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,929
on

130
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:51,209
start these outages store cascading
these outages and start moving out a

131
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:56,249
concentric circles would not be hard to
cause a small outage to become a large

132
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:05,430
out

133
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:37,430
now allows you to take control of
elevators you know penetration testers

134
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,470
have been doing this for a long time ago
hiding elevator we frame when it leaves

135
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:48,000
and you're in like Flynn of course they
had to turn his the terrorism situation

136
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,790
you can buy serve as key elevators
online no big deal

137
00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:09,620
well yeah so I can find on a minor in
which you know Adrian's been at the

138
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:17,270
forefront of looking at this week the
New York Washington Post posted this

139
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,439
picture

140
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,550
well guess what this day and age we can
actually make your hundred I'm key so

141
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:31,080
people are now 3d printing tsaka keys
adrian has a bunch of them here that

142
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:40,540
he's made so the idea of having a single
key roles or even a few key is it

143
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,210
controls important things is a very
dangerous in the case of companies have

144
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,880
this thing called the 90 Nike Nike let
you win do anywhere you need lock in

145
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,080
their infrastructure has the same case
this is not an eye Nike this is actually

146
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,390
a fire service key we haven't I Nike
we're not going to show it to you people

147
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:07,700
take pictures of it and start 3d
printing it but that goes to every piece

148
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,179
of infrastructure company also big
shout-out connection who's watching on

149
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:18,070
the live stream of messages coming

150
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:28,050
it is they are too smart nationwide its
company-wide I'm gonna talk to you a bit

151
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,920
more about the 99 K and tell you why
that is as everybody's like this one

152
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,610
where would you have one kid and it
doesn't open the substations they are

153
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,110
you gonna find out really need open the
substations the reason there is such a

154
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,990
thing called a 99 K and I don't know
what it is in Kentucky power but I

155
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:56,190
worked for Appalachian Power the cars
when you have these huge outages and the

156
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,160
first thing happens when you have a
great big out is what do you guys see

157
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:12,380
you see power company trucks from
everywhere and that's because we don't

158
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,070
know where we're going but the reason
being whenever you have to take control

159
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,590
of our on whenever an individual has to
take control of the land

160
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:27,300
take what's called clear that means you
have to have the only key forward and

161
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,520
you have to take it out when you take it
out that means never wants to go back on

162
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,430
that hypothetically but every lock was
different can you imagine what that

163
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,790
would be how hard it would be to give
contractors to give even their company

164
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:50,040
employs the way to go to go out here and
Swiss of distribution that needs to be

165
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,970
switched out and we get a whole section
of town so this is why we have a 99 key

166
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,850
as that's what was going to happen for a
while then I Nike was opening

167
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:07,600
substations but they got a better system
that and they actually give us another

168
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,400
key which is basically and I Nike be
opened also stations

169
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:24,970
good job we have a problem whenever we
want to attack the parent and one of my

170
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:34,320
classes when I can't see you all glammed
and how we're going to shore now a

171
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:43,470
substation from a power line is 84 the
answer is what goes up must come down

172
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,620
this is taken near Marshall University
also actually it's taken on the fourth

173
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,850
level of a parking garage

174
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:58,620
do you think it will be a problem for me
to take it dog chain is not a dog

175
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:05,910
chained by the way is the world's
smallest dog given give you an example

176
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:11,810
here you think it would be hard for me
to take a dog chain also offer their get

177
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:16,900
it cause those three phases which by the
way those three phases are 34,500 votes

178
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:25,770
or to get into the bus work at the
substation wish I did that I substation

179
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:31,120
will just sit there for it would burn up
things and finally the ground is which

180
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,890
of the substation would kick in and kill
everything

181
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:40,490
the problem with that is when the ground
is which kicks and kills everything it

182
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,000
takes load pick up to pick everybody
back up when you take out a whole

183
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,840
substation all those customers first
thing you do when the power goes out to

184
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,560
go through stuff on right and then he
got to the second floor of your house

185
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,170
you turned off one another year for an
air conditioner not working you forget

186
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:07,410
about that and that's not a problem
except when the power is trying to pick

187
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:13,010
up all outlined just got bigger problems

188
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:24,930
asymmetrical warfare type scenario these
articles voters that they found the

189
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:32,630
polls wanna ride on my ride may be
hereafter thats 46,000 votes and the way

190
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:39,130
you can tell how many how much voltages
on the line for insulators the higher

191
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:44,260
the voltage that's not really hard to
figure it out is it would be hard for a

192
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:52,630
terrorist or somebody really matter
power over here on the other side we

193
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:59,760
have station breakers now those breakers
they cut the power from one side to the

194
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,810
other

195
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,110
if you through a chain across the top of
that it was a set their own operate and

196
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,180
explain something to you about your
power and the next time it starts

197
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,210
storminess starts to go all these other
fires going off and I'll tell you when

198
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,020
it's going

199
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:22,920
station breakers Andrey closers operate
three times on a different curve they

200
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,870
can also be set up to go off

201
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:32,220
instantaneously that very few are
because the closer's role on the line

202
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,570
and station breakers in the station is
if a tree falls over and that's burning

203
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:44,810
dropped to the ground and then go out
and seconds later so that's why if your

204
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:54,070
power blinks once twice three times you
probably don't our lives it and that's

205
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:59,720
something that takes a lot of Electrical
Engineering to do that and I'm telling

206
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,060
the truth and the area that I was then I
can't speak for this area or any other

207
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:09,630
area 44 nations a problem because you
have so many different factors to figure

208
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,440
you know that

209
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:27,740
attack vectors firearms can be very very
noisy the best thing that you could do

210
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,789
that I terrorists will do to take the
power grid down for their be nationally

211
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:40,419
regionally or locally his death by a
thousand cuts and what I mean by death

212
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:45,870
by a thousand cuts we're gonna talk
about the dog chase we're gonna talk

213
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:52,360
about 10 people that have the
information that I just gave you can we

214
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,250
all get together and decide we're gonna
go take out the city of Louisville so we

215
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:02,370
get together we passed out there about
$12 apiece

216
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:10,100
we also go down and reap bunches of
mylar balloons maybe you don't know this

217
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,759
but mylar is just as conductive as
aluminum really well when it wraps

218
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:22,860
around power lines and hits the other
devices and other hardware we're going

219
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:28,480
to do that and we're just going to go
out and spread out and we're going to

220
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,039
synchronize our watches like they do on
TV and we're going to say at 10 p.m. it

221
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:41,070
is 92 degrees out here tonight or is it
still below zero tonight we're gonna go

222
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,950
out we want to do this we're going to go
out

223
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:51,419
hey you guys do you believe that we've
read the to refine refine the search

224
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:57,450
transmission lines we had in our fathers
we previously identified as we said okay

225
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:06,559
let your blues go for your dog change it
to the serbs taters Tempe so we do that

226
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,050
times 10

227
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:15,250
I was a service restore they would call
me from Abingdon Virginia and say yeah

228
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:21,710
we got a prior owners down the road down
there tell me Rob Rob go check it out

229
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,780
checking out now would drop the first
thing I did the first thing that you

230
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,210
have to do as an area service restore
his patrol the land to make sure

231
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:35,390
nobody's like a normal and that cost to
make sure it's not on top of a house

232
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:41,740
like the fence that I got sued for sure
there's nobody on there so once that

233
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,220
happens which takes about an hour and a
half to two hours depending on what you

234
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,920
have to do if you've got to go get out
of rocket it takes a lot longer than

235
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,200
that truth gas probably don't have the
money to put two people in the truck

236
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,890
they don't want you to call out people
because they want you as an area service

237
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:08,180
restore take care of her job so we
should have better security in that the

238
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,680
problem with the security is they can't
pay for security listener a structure

239
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,630
its cost prohibitive because not just
anyone can work on power lines you have

240
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:24,180
to be trained most people in here how
was saying voltage over a hundred and

241
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,550
twenty votes

242
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:37,710
way less than that but I'm just being
here now I think the Wichita Lineman he

243
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:49,550
was talking about I think if I think he
was ok we're going to move on to the

244
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:55,540
ocean shipment 68 hours after all this
happens in the park I'm is gonna realize

245
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:02,490
oh shit something's going on now I know
that everyone in here thinks the parent

246
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:08,040
company has a great big board like they
have in him tied one in CIS all these

247
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:14,060
other things that they have these brands
and things than their peers

248
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:23,140
they do to an extent but its outages
were caused by natural causes or by an

249
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:30,100
attack they don't have that capability
so what happens is the emergency

250
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:37,840
generators started kicking the back
three occasions we can talk to each

251
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,190
other and the picture that I showed you
that was a very bad snowstorm like 42

252
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:52,170
inches of snow and the number one thing
that no one has to be out on the roads

253
00:28:52,170 --> 00:29:00,470
all you all stay off the roads emergency
vehicles only happen everybody want to

254
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,410
go out and see you play in the snow
provide therefore got stuck in the snow

255
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,860
we couldn't get anybody in there to help
us people got behind the fire trucks

256
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:15,650
they couldn't they couldn't back out so
you're back up you say well I got a

257
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:21,170
backup computer I mean I've got a backup
generator I have no problem within three

258
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:26,240
to five days you're not gonna have a
backup anymore unless you have a gas

259
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,210
station or propane filling station in
your backyard you don't have a prelab

260
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:40,570
fuel to run generators so you say would
be able to go get some well you gotta

261
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:46,810
think about this gas propane and any
other alternative fuel has to be have

262
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:52,280
power to be to feel your time and be
pumped up so you say well I've got six

263
00:29:52,280 --> 00:30:01,240
aah aah batteries back up and I've got
so recharging do you know what the

264
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,250
average draw is on your inverter because
that's key and that's important because

265
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:14,640
they found out I'd rather study that I
six-a age battery lasts you just run in

266
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,090
streaming Netflix two hours in three
minutes or so

267
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:31,970
the only reason that I feel like that we
haven't been attacked in this manner is

268
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:39,150
because he's got the balls to do it but
I also feel like that there is more of a

269
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:44,710
threat internally now with drive with
the internal upset that we have in this

270
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,900
country I think that we have more
disgruntled people in this country in

271
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:55,200
terrorist outside his country will ever
so I worry about these things that it

272
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:03,620
comes to the Charest who returned to you
need to identify terrorists but I'm

273
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:17,670
afraid they were going to be identified
some homegrown terrorists who is this is

274
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:24,030
not a hard thing to do we need to be
confident that these things can happen

275
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,640
to us and what we're gonna do about them
if they do happen

276
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:35,570
the main thing is we shouldn't panic we
should prepare her care there's been

277
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,120
able to attack occurred over the past
several months or lenders scale and one

278
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,670
in particular was april seventh seed
72015 power blackout affecting

279
00:31:44,670 --> 00:32:01,990
washingtonDC and they said

280
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:23,600
remember back in April last year when
the white house run out of power and we

281
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,500
actually saw a white house subcommittee
I mean White House press briefing in the

282
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:37,500
dark which was kind of funny and they
said well we've probably had a

283
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:44,330
transformer near Frederick Maryland and
I say it was near Frederick Maryland

284
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:50,630
Fort Meade sorry security headquarters
of the United States they're protecting

285
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:59,710
our servers and not bad days later
another outage they said it was all

286
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,070
there must have been a construction
problem now do you do you really think

287
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:14,060
that that happened that they don't know
what happened

288
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:20,020
here's a picture of the white house
press conference on 47 2015 and at least

289
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,620
now we are all in the dark

290
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:31,830
some tweets that found kind of amusing
power outage

291
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:38,010
contest a hotdog for folks just keep
working and paying your taxes

292
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:43,100
sounds fishy to me said receptor I'm
sure you all can read this point is

293
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:50,760
showing you this is we're not taking it
seriously we're not thinking that maybe

294
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,670
we are being tested physically maybe
there is a problem

295
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:10,800
the facts because of the inherent paper
and their inherent power grid we can

296
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:18,760
protect them we can't insulate the wire
we can't bury the wire it's too cost

297
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,080
prohibitive and I keep going back to
cost prohibitive and it's just we can't

298
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:28,620
do it they then the park near will not
do it they shouldn't actually recently

299
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:34,560
find another way to protect these things
I haven't security on the power grid and

300
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,720
the infrastructure

301
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,590
races folks when the part where it goes
down everything goes down eventually

302
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,150
your computer's goes off I don't care if
you're the best care in the world the

303
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:51,230
best hacker in the world is still
eventually this affects sewage it

304
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:55,350
affects water it affects hospitals
communication everything the government

305
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:00,090
runs on the internet on a security
network it affects everyone the power

306
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:08,910
goes down we're done so figure out what
was going on here and I key worded

307
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:15,450
sabotage power lines and I got 306,000
results but one particular result of God

308
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,500
I'm sure some of you are aware of this
as I began just before 1 a.m. on April

309
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,690
16 2013

310
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,750
snipers opened fire on nearby electrical
stations night team is the question I

311
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,940
have here is how do they know they shot
my team and someone did not somebody say

312
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:39,980
that's a problem right now 17 giant
transfers let me tell you something

313
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,859
about these giant transformers is some
of what happened to do something like

314
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:48,800
they're the power companies around
around this country don't keep a lot of

315
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:57,000
these pair things laying around there's
expensive this powers to Silicon Valley

316
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,880
disappears quickly utility workers 27
days to make the repairs and bring the

317
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:12,099
station back on July 27 days as anybody
in here think that they can keep theirs

318
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:26,589
their stuff and running for 27 days and
it's actually these people whenever your

319
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:33,849
power goes out your so I can to the 17th
century and whenever we experienced

320
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:37,869
these kind of things we don't realize
how dependent we are and that's really

321
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:44,160
the point of this talk to realize how
dependent we are and how vulnerable we

322
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,770
are however the power country for 24
years I know what I'm talking and this

323
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:57,900
particular region and telling you I
found a lot of like Buster attitudes

324
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,310
toward security and the power company
that I work for and I found it they just

325
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:09,020
they weren't very proactive about fixing
things they just said when it burns down

326
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,250
will put it back up

327
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:22,450
that's wrong in this state we can't do
that anymore we have to do better

328
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:38,490
now playing can only repeat green family
if he ever has dementia as I have a

329
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:46,599
little bit of myself so I'll talk to you
about a little bit about safety in case

330
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,780
the worst worst don't happen but the
only way I can figure that it hasn't

331
00:37:51,780 --> 00:38:00,720
happen now he may start of it but if you
do happen to be on an outage just safety

332
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:09,680
tips and I'ma pass along from you to me
radio every I don't have a drive over a

333
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:19,160
power line if you can help it but it's
not a good idea if you get caught in

334
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,890
your car and apparel line happens to
fall down on top of your car

335
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:27,050
dancing and if I was flat like in the
movies which doesn't really happen by

336
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,349
the way most things you can find a
paralyzed he's your car is your tired

337
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:44,290
but if you suspect that attach in email
in your car keys but I can promise you

338
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:52,820
your keys in your car you drive a fiat

339
00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:09,360
and whatever city car and his car is
Connor popemobile Colliers a bill what

340
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,530
you want to do is you want to keep your
body your seventies close to you keep

341
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:19,410
everything in because power travels from
here to here from there to their it just

342
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,680
does weird things like that if you have
to get out if you feel like your car's

343
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,260
getting ready to blow up a kitchen fire
you wanna take an open your car with

344
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,240
anything they can do this cuz power
clinton's you want to try to hope your

345
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,970
car door and when you don't step out of
your car

346
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:43,040
the shoot doors away Clearview and comp
like a bunny for as long as you can

347
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,950
because there's something is called step
potential which means if this $7,200 on

348
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:54,310
the ground you spread your legs out why
you get seven thousand to impose between

349
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:59,890
your legs your heart so you may look
funny during the bunny hop out of her

350
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:06,020
car that you live to tell about it is
that makes a really funny story and I

351
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,260
think you want to do is in a
thunderstorm anything like that you want

352
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:15,280
to avoid standing other transformers
transformer is to be a great thing on

353
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,760
the poll that call it that gives you
power I'm sure you'll be able to

354
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,520
recognize if you look at you don't want
to stand underneath it i've been

355
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,540
underneath them and I've actually close
them and what they both the top is

356
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:31,920
burned completely off which gives you a
nice 40 gallon shower of red-hot metal

357
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:38,700
porcelain and warning or stay away from
this also want to stay away from lab

358
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,680
duties which I realize you probably
don't know what they are but I know

359
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,930
everybody in here at one time or another
or will at one time or another

360
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:51,740
here he shot gun go off behind your
house and you think

361
00:40:51,740 --> 00:41:12,660
your sister 4343 for me to say I'm sorry
whenever transfer fees or I'll a few

362
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,020
blows you just want to stay away from
polls in general because when they blow

363
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,160
it you hear that noise and I'm sure some
of you heard that noise that is a

364
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,030
shotgun blast shooting out hot lad and
medal at the bottom of that well we

365
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,470
actually call a barrel so you wanna stay
away from all these things I'm still

366
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,990
here just to keep you safe

367
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:35,470
what can I tell you to guard against
when the power goes down from the grid

368
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:41,140
check your answers if you use a backup
batteries check that up and make sure

369
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:46,400
this will test see what you're very
staunch you must draw your dawn and just

370
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,830
protect yourself and he will you
possibly can and remember if it's not

371
00:41:52,830 --> 00:42:04,940
grounded its not dad and I and on the
ground not how like you that's that's

372
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,990
the end of our former presentation
couple things I want to say thanks for

373
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,619
coming there are some other attacks
power grid we did not cover we have

374
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:20,260
methods who will chair the grounding
wire around power stations around

375
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:26,390
substations so so they can make math and
that's why they've been another big

376
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:36,050
issue in West Virginia yeah it may or
may not depending email so cute dog kick

377
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:42,160
off the Breakers really wrestled with
having this tape something people want

378
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,619
to see it we want to put out there
there's also the stories the Union

379
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:54,800
problems in a coal mine you can take
ranch and basically drain the oil output

380
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,609
transformer that will make a go up
pretty quickly I said you don't need a

381
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:02,350
ranch are you have to do is open the
spigot that the bar

382
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:10,240
of the transformer firing firing rounds
are crossing into a transformer is also

383
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:20,240
prevalent West Virginia we don't have a
lot to do you want to say as a shout out

384
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,770
to secure WV which is coming out in
November

385
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:37,870
like a 14 hour talk on physical security
thanks for comin have a good evening

386
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:53,720
don't get too drunk to keep your
waitresses so I go crazy
