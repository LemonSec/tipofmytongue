1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
so we're talking about building a better
honey pot network one that gives you

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,389
some intelligence something more than
what I'm seeing so far and stuff I

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:17,160
played with I have been doing this for
like I guess last month and a half and

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,820
new to certain things like flask which
is used to display stuff and I thought

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,689
stuff so it's taking me a bit longer
than some people might and it's a little

6
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:34,540
bit rough but I have it out there and
get help so I'll just walk through so my

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:41,329
name is Josh I'm a security analyst with
OpenDNS and Cisco now been acquired I

8
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,670
was previously a threat analyst at nasa
and helped build the security operation

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:54,309
center there and threat analyst at
minutes so I'm dealing with currently

10
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:58,210
with four actually I have a few more
honey pots but I haven't been processing

11
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,250
the data but their counterparts in
dealing with in my instance are

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,619
necessary pot a malware honey pot one
that involves gas tanks which is awesome

13
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:16,780
and scared a lot not go into more detail
that so the amusing calorie it's a fork

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,299
hippo which is a sshit potting medium
interaction and empower people attackers

15
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:30,520
can connect in that think they're SSH
into a system in which to log files

16
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:38,079
kipah writes this one log file calories
JSON log files and log

17
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:47,350
. log JSON formatted for certain
databases for easier to work with a

18
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,409
little bit easier they both have a
little bit different information so I

19
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:57,570
process both when I'm looking through
the border with them create session

20
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,200
files just like hippo

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,229
if someone connected and it will record
whatever the type and which is great cuz

22
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,430
you can replay it but the session files
are treatable and beatable but it's a

23
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,640
mess there's actually a Python script
it's included with capo or calorie or

24
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,900
other parks that place for you so I i
read a script that takes that and saves

25
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:31,379
about to text files saved ttyl and then
session replay file file date final game

26
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,480
of some sort

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,129
carries great because hippo I remember
it only allows about to I think two

28
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:44,660
accounts to log in and if you want you
can set up more passwords which is a

29
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,430
pain to get to watch for a lot of
connections and then look at the office

30
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,930
login and you can add those passwords
and to a file of the most people are

31
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,970
allowed those accounts are allowed to
log in but Calgary has only two or three

32
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,810
that would allow the root root and root
password I think everything else is

33
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,209
allowed so I just wanted as many
connections as possible some people want

34
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:15,550
to specify I do a couples rule to send
all port 22 traffic honey pots to to the

35
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,349
port that carries listening on and then
I changed by admin access so I can still

36
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:25,659
get into the system do what I need to do
to a different port usually it's 2222 I

37
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:34,690
feel like that becoming pretty well
known I went up 10 seizing diarrhea it's

38
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,640
malware its goal is to get get a copy of
the power that and it's listens on a

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,090
whole bunch of ports kind of weird

40
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:53,629
Italian time I managed to figure out
install it kind of pain it reached a

41
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:59,310
sequel a database which is also kind of
annoying some some tiny parts right to

42
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,580
log files some right to databases they
all

43
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,050
different different projects they are in
a single single organization even though

44
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,100
that project i think is trying to bring
us all together

45
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,250
saves malware to a folder called
business dreams as always kind of

46
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,109
strange maybe there's a reason for it
anyway I'm just pointing out that

47
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,210
they'll save different places all season
cohn pot which is a state a honeypot

48
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,510
it's awesome

49
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:35,260
imitates industrial control systems so
that rights to fly a lot of that text

50
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:42,660
files which is great and i'm looking
aghast just cause its so cool and laid

51
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:50,230
sensors and gas tanks so people who
connects to them can misrepresent the

52
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:56,440
temperature of the gas tank and other
such things this article here

53
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:04,500
Trend Micro details the whole process
and great know it's a PDF document but

54
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,860
those are fun to play with

55
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:13,390
there's only if you download the
specifications for the gas tank sensors

56
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,240
you can buy all the commands you were
type

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,280
play with it these are the open ports on
just the honey pot then using for this I

58
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:30,360
had to honey pots running they're both
on Amazon and I was going to speed up a

59
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,360
whole bunch last night they do that so
but this is was running just a quick and

60
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,780
not scan of this specific honey pot so
there are some obstacles its lesson is a

61
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:50,320
pain because they're all different every
anybody's different diet doesn't like

62
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,950
Ubuntu after 1200 for for some reason
I'm using Ubuntu found that out the hard

63
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,140
way there was a dependency and need it
so I just amusing 1204 I didn't want to

64
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,169
limit to limit people with what I with
the code I wrote and put on github

65
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:12,020
but you and I intend to use data or you
can try to figure it out it's a shell

66
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,830
script which I get into too honey pot
networks that are interesting I actually

67
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,150
have one here which is the modern
hunting network and its really popular

68
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,340
and I love it was what really got me
interested in the guy Jason who wrote it

69
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,830
he's done a great job of bringing
together a whole bunch of different

70
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:40,259
spots and installer for a server it's
it's like basically a quick shell script

71
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:47,110
it actually he prefers to 1204 as well
for many pots and server and when you

72
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,520
install it provides a script that you
can put up honey pots and adjust

73
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,589
automatically uses HP feeds which is an
interesting it's a way to transmit data

74
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:06,120
securely to the server or to other
servers the result of it is as map you

75
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,529
can it's not it's not persistence at the
bottom there are connections you can see

76
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,830
as they happen

77
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,330
states and countries and states just one
big huge country to country is just

78
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,819
light up and little dots appear when
things happen but if you navigate away

79
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:27,930
and come back all that goes away that's
kind of what I can do stuff which is I

80
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,500
guess cool there's another threat map
that might seem to be the main goal of

81
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,749
honeypot servers and hopefully you know
the North's 11 looks great

82
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:46,080
it's awesome actually that but having
been a threat analysts

83
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:54,180
Napoli is useless to me it's it doesn't
do anything I don't know so I men's

84
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,779
gloves look at it though they love to
have a big screen with about that but

85
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,409
internet hacking attack a tribute
attribution map is actually the best mad

86
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:08,069
you can get it makes you sound like you
and you can actually get that that's

87
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,939
available for free though the pew pew
attack map which is I was gonna install

88
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:13,680
it on my server

89
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,410
maybe later so we want more

90
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,430
we want to be like that guy like rats
but we want to look we learn Russian but

91
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,740
wait and infiltrate carding forums and
get death threats over be like this guy

92
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,149
he's an actor but you know the character
you want to know what the attackers are

93
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:38,000
thinking or want to know what these
people are thinking these two are wanted

94
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:49,339
by the FBI won't bother with china but
we are we deal with reports that are

95
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:54,490
basically in the past reports with
government and a lot of these ones that

96
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,420
I've dealt with in the past they all get
list of demands thousands of domains

97
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,230
things that are associated with some
kind of pot that is something that all

98
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,750
go through these debates and I'll see
legitimate demands like microsoft.com so

99
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,040
you have to do a lot of busy work to get
through all this crap that stain and

100
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,890
it's sometimes it's really outdated they
give you they being whatever agency or

101
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,760
department gives you what they give you
a mess we deal with reports and company

102
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,410
is this is a good report but a lot of
times there this cued towards the

103
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,220
company there a marketing vehicle and
you can get some good intelligence but

104
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,800
often out there are a lot of a lot of
work on their part and time has passed

105
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:48,720
another company report we could do some
feed so probably all if you're

106
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,529
interested in this car thing subscribe
to blog all sorts of stuff of course

107
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:58,440
this hacker Google Google Alert doesn't
get everything correct i rly I really

108
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,980
get anything from this except news but a
lot of great blogs but it's still all

109
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,470
the past we want to be like one of the
ppl releasing the blog post the release

110
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,880
of the new information so we want
actionable intelligence I want to

111
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,180
predict the future a little bit that's
always what I thought I have my goal has

112
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,550
been

113
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:24,399
as a threat analysis to predict the
future and get to it before the before

114
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,190
they can get my organization so I goals
with his project are an easy

115
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,470
installation

116
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,519
actually covers that pretty well I was
very influential I just didn't like but

117
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,540
now has the goal to have statistics to
but statistics don't tell me either and

118
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,269
I'm doing threat analyst secure
communication I just wanted to make sure

119
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:51,620
everything was traveling in the clear
the stuff I'm using doesn't you driving

120
00:10:51,620 --> 00:11:00,450
safely the stuff I'm using I'm using be
elk stack plastic surg lock / day it's

121
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,980
not secure naturally as do some things
on top of it

122
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:15,670
embrace new technologies like alcohol so
I wanna get useful information so the

123
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,010
management issues with all these honey
pot so you have forty honey pots out

124
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,700
there are a hundred honey pots all your
stuff is out there you have all these

125
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,959
different kinds of honey pots
everything's in different folders

126
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,790
databases should be easy to get to

127
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,440
but it's not so this is my initial
diagram I haven't changed it there's

128
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,839
that whole blog move I i dont know that
I just want some scripts that I don't

129
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,430
have a whole lot group and I move logs I
i many parts of the bottom final rules

130
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,709
I'm not sure about that either but I
have on the honey pots lock stock picks

131
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:56,209
up the blogs and does various things
with them based on filters are written

132
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:03,180
as total to secure connections basically
transparent to the system so it's the

133
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:11,660
applications that use it and then over
to the server which is wearing red is as

134
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,890
a law blog broker broker lock / again
runs and it's picking things up with

135
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,379
filters and then goes into elasticsearch

136
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,979
and then come on at this place also have
some scripts that which I have actually

137
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:30,859
about to get into that use other cool
stuff so it's pretty easy installation I

138
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:36,589
have this one script down here and this
these two folders right there

139
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,419
shell script you can see everything that
since that it does not modify it as

140
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:46,879
indeed it is great it's really easy to
configure

141
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:53,169
listen to local port and send off to
another IP to a port and keeps the

142
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:59,759
collection encrypted using Redis is a
day to broker I don't know much about it

143
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,179
except that it burgers data pretty well
so then lock / mix it up

144
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:10,799
iconoclastic search and this is this is
a screenshot of just the dashboard that

145
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,189
had built for

146
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:18,029
wanna get access the elasticsearch
database you can see in this one has got

147
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:25,059
a lot of its assets loggins I think I
chose to view 40 41 months you know I

148
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:31,350
put a server online last week in Sao
Paulo Brazil and within seconds ahead

149
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,239
connections is critical

150
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:38,589
got a lot of gas population some of
these are testing got Khambhat

151
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:44,529
connections I it's still actively in
progress I have filters and lodged a

152
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,720
shit look for certain things and then
that stuff gets pushed into

153
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,629
elasticsearch so that you see a proper
account of things but I of course had

154
00:13:52,629 --> 00:14:00,139
the threat map map has to be there so
it's not as amazing as Norris but I'm

155
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,609
sure you can work with that the client
installations just as easy after you

156
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:11,119
install the server it actually writes a
client shell scripts down at the bottom

157
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:16,829
there and this client folder heads up
stop and saves in the folder and you get

158
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:22,539
instructions in your terminal how to get
that and go install any honey pots so

159
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:25,629
the scripts that have running these are
the client I have two scripts I try to

160
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:26,649
keep it minimal

161
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:31,430
I didn't want too much processing done
on the client systems have getting our

162
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:37,860
info dot tie this gets the hash right
now it's not before functionality that i

163
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,389
won

164
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:44,889
but the hash and information to file for
lock / to process send over to the other

165
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:51,589
system for actual processing then I have
read ttyl which as I explained earlier

166
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:56,610
to such as this ttyl files from the
hundai SSH any pot that saves it to

167
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,889
normal text reprocessing letter O three
ttyl just see this is what it looks like

168
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:06,019
it's just this is actually just opened a
text file this is a screenshot of that

169
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:13,629
so you can see it's the downloading
something it's a messy text file so but

170
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:17,759
it's easy to parse through that with
Python and get interesting information

171
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:26,439
that that well redundant but there's a
piece of the lock stock filter it's just

172
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:33,429
it's just text it's pretty simple their
work through some else commands what's

173
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:40,050
this green oh yeah this is my these are
those files on the server they bypassed

174
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:47,329
with lock / through a star to sit in
this folder copy files and coming and

175
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:53,490
then my python script to read these
files and processed through them so any

176
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,389
analysis folder I have a bunch of
different things I've got some these API

177
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:02,149
key subtext those asshole by API keys
for two things I'm using for the moment

178
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:09,139
gonna be adding more than a second so
the IRA Stoll API this reads hashes from

179
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:14,499
that file that was sent over from any
pots and sensitive IRA Stoll getting

180
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:20,660
back to results that's useful it'll be
better when I can

181
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:27,800
set up to actually send files that have
been seen yet I'm also working on

182
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,389
integrating malware dot com or if you
want your own could be sent box inside

183
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:34,240
your own

184
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,769
is that your own environment compound
reader this reads the JSON and the

185
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:48,579
laptop log files and formats for
database calorie compound reader I get

186
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:53,490
mixed up because I miss him so much and
I just read the one log file our reader

187
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:58,209
reads JSON to end the log files and
formats for debates then gasped

188
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:03,870
operators same thing using special
things like the virustotal API which you

189
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,089
can you can use that for free but you
have a limit of four calls per hour

190
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,829
which is kind of annoying so I'm using
the paid one thanks to the company also

191
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,059
using OpenDNS investigate which is
basically a Google search for domains

192
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:27,780
and IP addresses which is a paid thing
or you could work there and analysis

193
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,789
that's coming actually so this is kind
of a quick view but just looking

194
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:38,260
investigated i this is a screenshot from
Intel portion of the thing which you'll

195
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,570
see more of a moment it's just it this
is a SSH connection they collected and

196
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,640
called out to these IP is right here
over on the left side and I got some

197
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,220
information just who is data from
investigate who is data is this one part

198
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,419
of what you get from investigate I'm
looking at that I P that in some doubt

199
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:02,970
to this is the web interface of you got
to the same informations who is this

200
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,049
information

201
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:09,559
another view of another IP this is a
connection in and the password they

202
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,510
typed and

203
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,360
and the username I got some information
and then you can get more stuff with the

204
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,720
API it's all documented online its
public you could see all the demands

205
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,320
associated with the various network
prefixes are in progress and doing and I

206
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,970
a narrator which comes from sequel light
which is overpaid as I you know I'm

207
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:39,200
learning Python so it's enough work for
mother now to get everything going as it

208
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,230
has been but this is an active
development I'm not gonna be stopping so

209
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:47,660
keep going I'm hoping maybe other people
would be interested in contributing I'm

210
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,790
doing passive TNS research as well
there's a really great three passing TDs

211
00:18:53,790 --> 00:19:00,380
different you can run on your system and
database or text file malware analysis

212
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,480
and to doubt the ability to download
malware specifically when it comes to

213
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,250
the honeypot actually you know but mass
downloaded all of you want to do and I

214
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:19,200
want to play log CSI cyber style gets a
red code code and download season just

215
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,450
been kind of lazy that's a really simple
thing just need to make its rights to

216
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,560
see its feet but I so you need metrics
continue to move a little faster

217
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:35,140
dashboards need searching and you need
that that threat map so I've got to that

218
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:42,390
map as you see in very exciting this is
searching I searched for a spot I got

219
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:49,910
some results this is the this is what it
looks like the Intel Poor's in its kind

220
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,590
of mess just let in class so it's not so
durable yet but I will sort it and it's

221
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,810
just give me that whois informations
that is really not a whole lot I'm

222
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:04,360
getting the login information I'm so far
I'm looking at like things like gas pipe

223
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,000
connections the commander types

224
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,030
connections I need to add in the
commanding heights

225
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:17,770
there's a lot more I can get from this
as I built it out I also have a just a

226
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,530
Reg txt file of all the other get
requests in basically the DUP cap mode

227
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,960
into a text file that works like this
you can't really read about it he look

228
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,210
at peak apps follow his dream of
something it's the GET request of the

229
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,350
interesting things trying to figure out
exactly how to make it so that this

230
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,230
becomes something that is you can
quickly look at it and go oh this is

231
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,820
what's going on down in the world so
this is where you can get it at the

232
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,680
school

233
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:55,700
fade so I'll actually just real quick I
think I have a seconds so you have it

234
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:04,720
open you know I demagogues so I this
morning I couldn't connect to my mind if

235
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,510
I can connect to it

236
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:15,330
wondering what the heck was going on and
it turns out it got the IP address

237
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,800
changed like on Amazon Web Services I've
never seen that happen before

238
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:27,720
kind of a pain to really get to but we
can you guys see connections coming in I

239
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:37,350
can we make it smaller portion which is
way more interesting in my opinion what

240
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:42,490
you decide screenshots of second see
connections I've got some testing those

241
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:49,670
me this morning actually led to that
stuff but there's that's not me testing

242
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:57,300
that went down there and I can look at
unsuccessful as the stage which is

243
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:05,190
useful call outs to IP addresses moment
demands I'm sorry that the screen is so

244
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:15,620
I can but this is the part that I like
but it's a mess so his mouth where that

245
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,600
has been found on virustotal

246
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:26,910
it's a lot of Lenox Mall where a bunch
of stuff indeed US stuff I had a link

247
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:32,010
way over there right its formatting but
you could see him go and actually go

248
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:39,330
look at the look at them ever stole Inc

249
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:49,799
well whatever you can you get the gist
of it so you can read about it all sorts

250
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:53,460
of cool stuff so I'm gonna keep adding
to it hopefully become more awesome and

251
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,480
something more useful I wanted to become
a threat to you something that you can

252
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,669
use in your organization or your
personal life or whatever you want maybe

253
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:09,130
get some statistics but also to add is
more pretty metrics because people do

254
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,750
like that and actually is very useful to
get a quick overview of what you think

255
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:22,280
people are going to think I'm almost
done I have two questions what's the

256
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:30,360
last web framework it's like django but
it's much smaller yeah it's a it's

257
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,289
pretty easy to work with

258
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:46,030
go back to this thing better than anyone
available just go ahead and take it and

259
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,070
use it do what you want with it it's all
right there it's very easy to work with

260
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:57,200
I'm gonna keep on updating I i i keeping
committing almost every day one issue is

261
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,490
of course if you don't have to
investigate access or whole API key

262
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,830
those things will work yet for you but
I'm gonna add other stuff I don't think

263
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,900
it's right to have just things that are
cost money so I like he should be able

264
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,450
to pull from our dot com L W R dot com
which is a complete sandbox online but i

265
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,419
dont server

266
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:24,389
don't have an API really available but
we have a awesome in turn I think he's

267
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:29,330
an employee now but he's written an API
for it so he's like he's allowing me to

268
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:43,330
take that and imported into this recall
who I will thank you very much
