1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,990
I would say good morning but it is
neither good nor morning right it's 1230

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:17,449
now so we're past noon so alright let's
get started right so my name is like

3
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:22,050
fresh I'm gonna be talking to you but
some password cracking stuff and and

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,900
quite honestly it's a little bit about
basics and but we need to bring back to

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,619
basics to to get started so let's have
some fun we're not having fun and our

6
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:39,830
jobs it's not the right job alright so
all my password hash I bring my sorry

7
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:45,680
all my password cracking brings a hassle
yard so you get the idea so now I'm

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,890
going to bring it by just about every
one of these slides from here on out

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,510
contains spider-man means yeah you know
what I'm talking about

10
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:02,710
alright so you know the theme you know
all my password hashes brings the boys

11
00:01:02,710 --> 00:02:54,120
to the yard let's start this rate was
really do this way

12
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:20,530
coming

13
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:33,700
all right that was cool serious only a
little or no go

14
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,830
alright so what about me a little bit
about me so I mean countries tester

15
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:44,500
hardware hacker all the all things
awesome company called ingredients that

16
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,270
we do all that type of thing in my
brother in or near Hyde on one of our

17
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,500
guys couldn't be here so he's actually
face time so that's what FaceTime is who

18
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:08,970
are right so I don alright everybody say
hi daughter any 123

19
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,319
guys you guys rock on another note when
you get invited to Crystal Method after

20
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,820
party it is not a challenge to drink all
their booze

21
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,020
leave at that point so I do all the
stuff for free

22
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,530
guardians I love my ingredients family
that's awesome I'm also one of the guys

23
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,470
that man's the password cracking ring
and quite honestly when I first started

24
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,220
minimum password cracker I had no idea
what I was doing some might argue that I

25
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,190
still dont but im gonna

26
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,150
in part but I've learned over the last
two years to two guys as well I'm also a

27
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,060
certified sentence and the structure of
been teaching percent want to say five

28
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,930
or six years now it's it's all a blur
that it's hot it's lots of fun so I I

29
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,010
love to expand into that mantra we take
the sands approach at the mall security

30
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,910
we could contest for those of you who
have listened we want to give you guys

31
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,640
something that you can take back to your
office and do sort of immediately affect

32
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,110
that type of change so we've been doing
the polls security weekly thing this

33
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:25,289
October 16th heavy entire day podcasts
entire day like 12 hours why because our

34
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:28,940
10 year anniversary been doing the same
forty years

35
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:41,400
the first one you know we were shocked
that anybody was home to the scrap we're

36
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,480
still shocks that anybody was scrapped
so thank you thank you for those that do

37
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:51,360
in an unrelated to this talk I'm also an
extra class ham radio operator my

38
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,190
understanding is that 130 after this
part is over there doing some hemorrhage

39
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,250
exams where I'm not exactly sure they're
going to text me during the talk has to

40
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:05,590
tell me where I need to show up
downstairs an aqueduct writes all find

41
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:12,910
my way there afterwards alright so I
apologize I start on this one

42
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,860
a disclaimer see I told you cause you're
going to be Spiderman meme through the

43
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,430
whole thing

44
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,420
little bit a disclaimer so what it what
the stock is what is talk is not there

45
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,940
there's really no right way to do
password cracking this is what I found

46
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,070
that works for me and quite honestly I
don't have all the answers so I don't

47
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,810
hear from for more of you afterwards my
contact info is gonna be at the inside

48
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:43,060
it works for you as well so in this talk
we gonna be talking a fairly simple

49
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:49,230
hashes internal MLM well not so much lol
because we have full tables for those

50
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,700
were not going to talk radio chain
tables we're going to more protests from

51
00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:01,000
the coarser standpoint simple hashes and
we can make these complicated and we'll

52
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,230
make some notes on that as well so we
can apply all of the principles that

53
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:11,990
talk to more complex has features that
take a lot more horsepower to bird or

54
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,880
something like the BPH you should keep
decrypting all that type of stuff it's

55
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,160
just going to be nowhere near as fast

56
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,120
so in order to press to meet certain the
goals for the discussion of this talk

57
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,310
we're we're not going to talk about a
couple of things one of those is sort of

58
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,900
multi by employees in court so no
support for Unicode we're talking about

59
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,510
ASCII text passwords and those types of
things so no multi language packs new

60
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:44,330
Unicode support but there's some really
great papers out there one of them

61
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:50,250
team has cap from a password cracking
competition where they expanded some of

62
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:56,780
the tools to support multibyte password
hashing and it was fascinating history

63
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,880
degree but we're not going to talk about
that we're gonna this is essentially

64
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,580
password cracking 101

65
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,060
so let's talk a little bit about our
problem thank your diary my pencils not

66
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,620
working they're going to get worse I
promises what does to that I didn't

67
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,170
include because they were just totally
inappropriate and awesome at the same

68
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:22,570
time right right so what happens when a
pen test and we've now got this huge

69
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,450
list of hashed passwords how how we make
these into real passwords that we can we

70
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,260
can use my original approach was great

71
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,539
take this list and fire marshal brute
force and the go through 1 through 7

72
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,110
password 147 cared for passwords in a
couple hours and an incorrect password

73
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:47,650
shows up and it says is gonna finish in
a week now my assessment is only five

74
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:53,630
days this is this is not working and if
it gets and of course what happens so

75
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,810
rarely gets to that seven character
password and consider it is going to

76
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:05,060
take a week to finish and I closed the
RDP session yet RDP its on Windows cuz

77
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,850
it's easy and then what happens I forget
about it

78
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,600
tax assessment ID password crack come up
and go back and hey what the last job

79
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,350
from a month ago is still running how
many times I've done that

80
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:26,149
yeah my basic so the brute force is
great but it quickly becomes very

81
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,180
overwhelming and quite honestly a little
bit unmanageable start getting two

82
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,220
passwords that are that sleepy
characters of water so we've got a

83
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,819
couple of ways we can address this and
one of them is by throwing money at the

84
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:39,339
problem

85
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:45,040
well the password cracking break that
that I have control of is my password

86
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,970
cracking does not belong to work but we
get to use it the big thing is is that I

87
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,100
built it to do all claim mining yeah I
guess I got lucky I was started doing

88
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:06,170
all costs so currency mining right at
the time windows coin took off

89
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:13,380
started and I had about 300,000 goes and
then they started doing requests for

90
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,790
donations to send the Jamaican bobsled
team to the Olympics they call fiber

91
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,959
didn't have funds to make it so they
started taking donations Jones going so

92
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:30,250
the price of dost skyrocketed cashed out
baby so important you cash out those for

93
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:36,069
Bitcoin yourself it going I made enough
at least to be able to pay for the

94
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:40,430
entire rigs of the rig ended up being
create just got lucky that's the thing

95
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,990
about volatile markets so sure you can
throw lots of money at the problem the

96
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,209
problem that I have used my chief
financial officer Raj not you might

97
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:55,810
chief financial officer is is stingy
she's the kind of person that was

98
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:02,279
separate to buy toilet paper so you get
more toilet paper show our age not quite

99
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,230
that bad so my chief financial officer's
wife every purchase that I have to make

100
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,589
over $100 has to be run by her which by
the way when you start learning

101
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:18,220
budgeting and but budget justification
this is great for working with your

102
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,880
significant other for justifying toys
because you have to go through the same

103
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,550
argument but honey

104
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:32,170
it takes money to make money sometimes
sometimes it does that cause then you

105
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,580
have to go into the justifications to
what ya know it works a lot and we stood

106
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,990
by what I mean by myself oh ok so some
of the other things that I found my

107
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,350
first car getting started

108
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,290
was that you know I go to go to Google
and start searching on password cracking

109
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,380
and what comes up

110
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,420
well here's how you run a tool here's
all the technical options

111
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,870
territory and the tool but very very
little actual methodology and that's

112
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,730
that's what I want to share with you
that the methodology that I've been

113
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:09,329
working on that works really well and a
big thanks to two lots of folks then

114
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:13,899
came up front we had some conversations
about what works in someone's based on

115
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:22,399
that some folks from Technica TV public
lots of his methodology and talking with

116
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,290
lots of folks at seeing what works for
them and sort of combining that those

117
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:35,600
approaches alright so some of the goals
quite honestly ponies alright so the

118
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,279
goals are is to get just enough
passwords to make our our assessment and

119
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,770
our penetration test be successful

120
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:49,020
unfortunately there's always going to be
that jerk with a 32 character password

121
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:55,709
just what we ain't got no one and most
of the times we don't need to pay

122
00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:01,470
because there will be that one guy
that's a domain admin he's not too smart

123
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,810
for she's not so smart so the problem
becomes is weak and crackpots a password

124
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,399
for loss of accounts we really need the
one has room for that one or two counts

125
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,360
it's really gonna get us further in the
organization so it's not about cracking

126
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,160
all the passwords but it's tempting to
get real close because we need that one

127
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,320
or two couples mark to counter the right
one of many

128
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,940
so most of the folks in many
organizations haven't really figured out

129
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:41,240
what makes up a good password correct
federal or state does no yes yes add

130
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,770
that to your word lists seriously had
those you're rootless alright so most of

131
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,180
the good folks in organizations haven't
really figured out what a good customer

132
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,240
is even though they may have been
instructed as to what a good password is

133
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,720
but for humans right how many of you are
lazy all of us know you whether or not

134
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,920
you know what you're lazy she's just too
lazy to raise your hand thank you sir I

135
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:16,630
rest my case so we don't necessarily
need to get all passwords and we just

136
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,870
need to find that one and some of those
are likely going to be based on folks

137
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:30,390
that have really lazy passwords hey so
aiming for her me aiming for a 65 to 85

138
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,770
percent recovery rate for a huge list of
hashes is great

139
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,870
necessarily speaking we've got a really
good chance of finding that one or two

140
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:48,390
counts that we need that are really
going to help us however 10% is heck of

141
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:53,920
alot more realistic why because we do
change the tax we find ten percent of

142
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,450
those passwords we find those ten
percent 10% on multiple machines and we

143
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:05,080
pivot pivot mercilessly with those ten
percent to find that one machine that

144
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,170
has delegation tokens as domain admin or
to find that one machine that has third

145
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:15,770
text credentials in some database or in
some text while that gets us essay and

146
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,030
then we can do command shell so it's
about finding really that 10% but if you

147
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,160
can get 65 to 85 percent it's game over

148
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,440
ok so we start talking about like
passwords break and we're not gonna talk

149
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,570
about customers bring here guys are
probably familiar with the attack but if

150
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:39,140
we're going to go for that 10% take the
whole hundred most common passwords in a

151
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,779
wordless

152
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:46,639
and run those first why you might get
five percent you're halfway there

153
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,410
of those high percent it may already be
came over and how long has that hundred

154
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:58,040
password attempts for wordless taken
like three minutes and it's done now you

155
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,800
guys gonna leave because that's that's
like so let's start at the beginning

156
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,850
let's start with that that wordless ok
so you can my page on to represent great

157
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:14,589
start I loved on the river uses word
lists and does a whole bunch of hash

158
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:18,850
types you don't even need a cheap
uterine it so I could run in a virtual

159
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:25,759
machine and go to town while I'm working
on other stuff we need a word list and

160
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:34,689
quite honestly I'm asking is small and
promised here and ron has awesome word

161
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:39,529
lists and it's going to get better but
those worthless are words that people

162
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:46,110
use in the public and with on sites that
have been disclosed but do not have

163
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,089
password policies in many cases we need
to get a little bit better it at some of

164
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:58,170
those worthless sorry little bit of my
chart but stop crying and look at my

165
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,009
spider balls this is probably one of the
most inappropriate ones that I've got

166
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:08,649
alright alright so CPU is great in a
pinch we can use John reprisal wordless

167
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:14,549
my goodness that one account maybe five
percent that's going to be really really

168
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:20,299
good for us but we need to do a little
bit better so if we start using GPUs

169
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:26,260
whether they be AWS or or something
other that that's really really good

170
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,679
however that's going to require us to do
a little bit of time up front we're

171
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,309
gonna have to spend some money if the
CFO to approve it we're gonna have to

172
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,640
figure out which operating system we
want to use and quite honestly I spent a

173
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,690
month trying to get my drivers for my
graphics cards to work on Linux yeah cuz

174
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,920
I saw him index

175
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:53,200
but I loved ones that same time let's
not forget ok yeah I mean it's hard but

176
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,440
Windows what can you do

177
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:03,570
download click Install Next Next Next
yes oh yes my password is on Windows

178
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:09,450
2008 Windows box that I have but I'm
actually gonna try to change that I got

179
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,350
some great feedback from some folks from
some of the the Kirkland mining stuff

180
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:24,800
they using distro you can install called
Camp get pimped up dork it's got all of

181
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,659
the mining stock market for currency
these guys are awesome enjoy all the

182
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,890
research that totally into figuring out
the best bang for your buck and free

183
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,880
energy costs and they they do a lot of
stuff about forget which cars are the

184
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,190
best and they've got this distro that is
configured install it go what'd you do

185
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:49,590
you install has cat and John the Ripper
on this distro and you're done so I'm

186
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,780
gonna move to that so some of the things
are now let's hear at a clients a

187
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,550
YouTube user password cracking what do
you what do you need to have secure

188
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,700
remote access to this box of the ashes
to it sometimes is easier said than done

189
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,220
especially when dealing with the
customers filtering or not

190
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:15,740
now my rig is modest to say at least I
didn't spend more than $500 on my room

191
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:23,240
and has three GPUs including a case
which is totally ghetto why I went to my

192
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,680
workshop and cut some wood table saw and
some threaded rod and some nuts and some

193
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,090
zip ties yeah it doesn't have to be
expensive and quite honestly this is

194
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:45,380
good enough for me and it works now you
can spend lots of money but not as much

195
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,070
as you think but you can't spend lots of
money

196
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:54,030
for example even baggage giving a talk
confessions of a minor are typically

197
00:19:54,030 --> 00:20:01,710
minor right after this record
confessions of a cluster yeah I was

198
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:07,050
talking with him earlier and on IRC and
fascinating you want to bring that to

199
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,510
the next level

200
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,980
cracking jokes he has talked up to this
a great fall one and it would just

201
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,590
happen to be that it was it was alright
so we need a worthless this is where a

202
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,140
lot of my methodology centers around the
word list so creating a word list is

203
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:32,530
more art than science this gets fun to
me it's a challenge to think about

204
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:38,180
generating these weren't so we take our
word lists and have a great basin now we

205
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:45,080
need to modify these so get ourselves a
word lists hey rock you thanks Ron it's

206
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:56,740
called security guard and then wait for
the ashleymadison.com texts turns coming

207
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:05,260
we tore it some other ones is a.net the
gentleman that said hey I'm gonna

208
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:12,930
released ten million passwords with Mark
Burnett thanks sir yeah this might be a

209
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,430
little overkill

210
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:21,280
million households decent size file
chances are you're gonna probably do a

211
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,140
better job starting small and wrapping
up so some of the things that I think

212
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,000
about his take that basic list and it's
gonna be missing so and I like to tailor

213
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,340
each one of my list for customer
depending on geographical area and you

214
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,120
name it and think about how people think
so have the basics and they are already

215
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:50,810
there at season's go to census said
Census Bureau to get all the popular

216
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:57,660
baby names around see people made their
customers after their kids so pick the

217
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:03,340
most popular baby names for the last
twenty years or longer now let's take

218
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,510
some of those and added so let's add
some structure to this base foundation

219
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:17,470
and then what's the word list before we
add any girls or anyone during or any of

220
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,720
those type so for each engagement or
each victim that I'm working with I

221
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,900
think about where they are and think
about what they do and build my word

222
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,810
list based on these actions so I know
where they are you don't list of all the

223
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,810
local cities and towns cuz it's a good
good chance that the folks that live

224
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,420
there are going to be commuting to our
office and they live somewhere nearby so

225
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:50,240
towns nearby local sports teams sports
teams members I don't do sports ball so

226
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,010
this is the part that I start along so
what are a twitch with sports teams are

227
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:59,960
here in Louisville I have no idea and if
you answer me get lost almost

228
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,060
immediately pick some names were local
landmarks because quite honestly lots of

229
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,730
stuff gets credit for this

230
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:14,320
think about to leave the hotel you take
a left at the front door area call

231
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,140
fourth Street Live

232
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,510
what do you think that someone in that
in an organization here locally to

233
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,390
louisville has a password

234
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:30,130
fourth Street or Court Street 43 live in
their in their list from a good chance

235
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,820
so take some local landmarks

236
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,520
other than that I found you ask someone
when you're on site or when you're doing

237
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,540
that kickoff call hey what's the food I
have to have when you're there so I was

238
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:50,640
in a row as I was at one of our customer
sites where I was escaping that travel

239
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,500
too much and I said what's the local
food to have to have and he said get a

240
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,250
govt TTA yeah

241
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:07,190
Cincinnati so guess what went in my word
lists ETA and never more pounds home

242
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,900
with me my god that's good stuff

243
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,510
yeah I had a refrigerator in my hotel
room in the freezer good to go get made

244
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,560
it home on the airplane put it back in
the freezer oh my gosh asked what the

245
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:25,000
local food is one you can get this nice
we can you figure since its season as he

246
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,700
is coming and then you also how awesome
food as well and you get great stuff

247
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:38,460
you're rootless because I like where the
chances are that you like your password

248
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:48,680
right grab that grabbed the list from
the company itself cool CWL totally

249
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,390
rocks we didn't assessment not all that
long ago in which their wifi password

250
00:24:53,390 --> 00:25:00,500
was in fact made up of words from their
webpage really really it wasn't

251
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,680
intentional they were served at random
words but yeah both of those words are

252
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:13,820
on their webpage content together under
those also take some of these variations

253
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,420
of the company name so you know what
happens when you mistyped the URL and

254
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:27,140
you get you will see all those in the
word list too so I'm gonna build a

255
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,390
custom wordless for every engagement and
then sort of build on those as well so

256
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:41,250
we're going to pillage plunder and
deliver Chocolate Rain right just got it

257
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:49,130
some of you just got it so very
compromised the system to get hashes

258
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,970
where did they come from the dish just
fall out of the sky

259
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,450
well maybe they did sorry that was
really bad

260
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:04,250
alright so they didn't just walk beside
the sky we got them from a system yours

261
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:11,020
that system use the resources that we've
got so much the village my my my good

262
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,670
friend and co-worker mike or didn't
entire talk on that knowledge the

263
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:23,360
village by what you get from these
systems that are helpful to you so go to

264
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,900
My Documents folder documents folder
take everything and used those and find

265
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,920
some really good stuff in their credit
the word lists now depending on which

266
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,190
system we get access to well if you get
access to a domain controller why are

267
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:46,320
you here you've got hashes joe for that
some other stuff to make controllers

268
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,410
maybe not so much hopefully domain
controllers two main control and don't

269
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,470
do file shares it's a great show

270
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:58,370
file servers fileserve fireballs
fireball web servers web serve don't put

271
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:03,830
them together but domain controller
doesn't necessarily going to have a lot

272
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:10,179
of good stuff on it so we have access to
other things such as a file server that

273
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:17,200
has a massive I'll share everything and
then also work stations where they're

274
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,730
allowed to file saved files locally grab
those as well

275
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:30,090
contents of files are awesome it's
awesome if you can find passwords . txt

276
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:35,870
not gonna happen a lot sometimes it will
but take all the content from there were

277
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,890
documents and so for the other one that
I love and this kind of blew my mind

278
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:48,110
when I was thinking about this was not a
file contents Ohio names something about

279
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,960
this

280
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,929
yes grab all the file names from the
system certainly windows system32

281
00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:00,289
standard but grab the stuff from the
user's home director and/or their My

282
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:06,570
Documents folder file something about
this how many people their password

283
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,929
their first-born child right now they're
not supposed to what they do and they

284
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:15,659
may add some letters and numbers to it
does have two things so my my oldest

285
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,669
daughter ate about two weeks

286
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:22,029
her name is Corinne it's spelled a
little different so you wouldn't

287
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:26,039
necessarily have that a normal password
list but what do you think my desktop

288
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:31,399
background is set through picture of my
shoulders and it's in my pictures holder

289
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:38,659
and it's called Korean . jpg pretty good
chance because I'm average user

290
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:45,070
the filename not the contents the file
name is current GPA what do you think

291
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,990
that my password may be based now on you
know my oldest daughter you know Sankar

292
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:57,140
in forty to grab the file names because
those are those are huge so how do we do

293
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:07,070
that script or so sorry to bash on Linux
to be able to grab filenames so doing a

294
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,700
less recursively and stripping some
names dropping some stuff off my good

295
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,909
friend tom was to say hey book you have
a problem and you use seven talk to fix

296
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:24,620
that now you have two problems no I used
to fix this

297
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:31,720
the first arc statement is to remove all
the spaces and my good friend Don Weber

298
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:38,380
Don Nelson every time I put a space in a
file name so I took that into account

299
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,460
and stripped at least seven spaces in
filenames

300
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,130
I'm that guy sorry dawn

301
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:49,340
now it's almost triple the species out
of those file names after we get back

302
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,580
from the US command and then give us
these filename without the extension

303
00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:02,740
keyword lists we can do the same thing
on Windows oh my god he knows no tax

304
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:10,770
processing is so hard on Windows not
even funny alright sweet got a wordless

305
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,250
we've got our city names we've got a
baby names we've got seasons if they're

306
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:21,340
not already there we've got sports teams
we've got names from actors onsen

307
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:27,310
supports teams we've got this from files
reprint cool

308
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:35,090
filenames now most organizations that I
go into don't allow users to use strict

309
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:42,490
dictionary words there has to be some
complexity so let's use some complex but

310
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:47,360
sad special characters let's add numbers
competitive numbers its two leads all

311
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,000
those set thanks how we make that happen
actually ran into someone was actually

312
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,510
had to log into their VPN and how to
create a password and says your password

313
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,630
must contain one uppercase one number
and one special character so included a

314
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,010
question mark

315
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:12,090
they said no you have not included a
special character question mark is not a

316
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:18,030
special character my experience yeah I
had to add a different special character

317
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,120
an exclamation work just fine

318
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:28,450
change the way you say the password
alright so we need to all this extra

319
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:34,850
bits numbers to be a special characters
so let's go in and munch this basic

320
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:44,160
wordless so how do we do that so we can
do this in a couple of different ways we

321
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,350
can do character placement change
capitalization now we can do character

322
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,240
addition concatenation so forth

323
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,010
numbers and special characters at the
beginning at the end

324
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:03,090
we now have a really robust list the
problem is that we started with a modest

325
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,840
list and now we're going to do all the
things to it and we're going to end up

326
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,730
with this massive list that's gonna take
forever to run through we need to be

327
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:16,260
smart about it so we got sort of two
ways we can do this and it's definitely

328
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:24,630
a phased approach start small run that
list do it again another change to those

329
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,510
the base wordlist when it again

330
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,960
change the wireless router again this is
not a set it and forget it

331
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,010
it requires Karen entire run of the
password cracking job now

332
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:40,470
sure you can set it and forget it force
an hour so we're gonna be one of those

333
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:48,090
things so we can add complexity but if
we don't manage that complexity we're

334
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,880
going to end up with a list of weirdness
that's a hundred gig and that's not

335
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,200
gonna finish that hundred-word list of
the time that are susman complete so we

336
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,000
need to be smart about it so how do we
do this first up use a little pies

337
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,300
thought that she said taking upside down

338
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:17,550
alright so one of my coworkers was kind
enough to write some Python to generate

339
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:22,430
cash cat and John the Ripper rules ever
talked about that

340
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:31,160
to do simple character substitution and
I was thinking this is gonna crazy do

341
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,670
things to my read this when I thought
about it like no it's not going to

342
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,750
actually extend the length of the words
of the word list because we're doing

343
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:44,250
substitution so do this first this this
becomes important it does have words to

344
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:50,560
the wordless but it doesn't increase the
length of those words so those are

345
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:57,150
wordless tools are again are actually
holding done so they can see via

346
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,530
FaceTime right now

347
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:10,820
hi dawn so sudden or repeat that for you
use Skype on dogs all but the ipython

348
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:20,139
alright so scared create a couple Python
scripts to actually create some rules

349
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,790
for us to use within either cash cattle
has cat and/or John the Ripper to do

350
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,690
simple substitution and we can change
those characters substitution based on

351
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:36,000
where we wanted the word and/or links
and all and all that good stuff and so

352
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,909
how we use that and then we use the
rules within your job so we end up with

353
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:46,550
some more Wordless alright

354
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,899
complex where this I'm glad you guys are
laughing it's too early right it's noon

355
00:34:52,899 --> 00:35:01,790
break alright so doing complex wordless
modification is interesting we have a

356
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,030
bunch of different ways we could do that
and we're talking about some of the

357
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,140
tools we can use to do that

358
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,780
coming up soon we can use John the room

359
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,970
John the Ripper wordlist rules to do
some wondering specifically my favorite

360
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:22,770
are the core logic that they used for
the DEFCON 2010 correct me if you can

361
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:29,480
challenge their point published their
cheer john dot com and then start using

362
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,530
some of those worthless but don't use
all the money rules at the same time

363
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,510
why'd you will end up with a terabyte
word lists and that's not what we want

364
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,390
that will get us all the passwords in
all the time it will take a year to run

365
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:51,290
through and there's tons of a ruthless
there you'll pick judiciously so grab

366
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:55,510
those core logic rules have them to your
configuration file and then pick which

367
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,580
ruled that you actually want to run if
we run all of them near the river this

368
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,770
is gonna be way too long and it's it's
not going to work but we can certainly

369
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:08,040
take that and pass this to some of our
next up is going to mass events going to

370
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,420
be very unmanageable

371
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:18,760
however we can run one of our individual
winless through a single house and

372
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,250
generate multiple word list and run
multiple cracking jobs that will be

373
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:28,630
really speedy and then have lots of care
and feeding so here's how we use those

374
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:33,670
wordless John to enter a password list
and then londoners based on our rule

375
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:40,380
alright so we have a word with that
we've had all sorts of fun with with

376
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:47,270
simple password substitution simple
character substitution and then we run

377
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:53,480
it through some some John to do for
logic replacement

378
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:02,089
nation and all sorts of the problem is
we've been a wordless that's huge and it

379
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:08,460
runs from one character to 20 bus or
more character words that's going to

380
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,849
take forever and what happens if the the
password policies only characters do we

381
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:18,880
really care about 1470 let's fix that
lets split those rule these worthless

382
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:30,180
into characters of various lengths so
this was my moment we can run really

383
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:35,109
fast run a password cracking based on a
word list if we only care about specific

384
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:40,410
link for one set of length ones like the
words if we can make a guess that at

385
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,569
least in the organization the password
length is a minute movie characters dole

386
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:53,569
Ron 137 sure it may not take all that
much time maybe 30 minutes but that's

387
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:57,980
thirty minutes that we don't have
started in characters run alert list a

388
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,829
list of characters that go

389
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:08,020
haven't spent a couple hours maybe a day
wanted nine characters and do it

390
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,700
individually

391
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,010
so it's definitely going to be an
iterative process process is going to

392
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,690
require care and feeding hey so how we
split this work we take this massive

393
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:25,520
worthless and we're going to split into
multiple lists of specific characters

394
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,170
and thank you Adam and done for coming
up with some totally awesome power shell

395
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:35,610
and in fact I took both of your
PowerShell commands and combine them

396
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:43,080
together for epic win sorry i didnt
tested before him so I don't know if it

397
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:50,540
actually works by trustees go by
trustees so sure now we have two

398
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:56,900
problems right to take a word list on
Linux and swept that word was out into

399
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:02,420
multiple wordless with specific words so
that we're now running in a car to

400
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:08,990
replace were any password at my
character with a great run that in a

401
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:13,910
Luke to do that word list or multiple
characters and I was lazy and didn't get

402
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:19,430
there on Windows it's a little bit
harder on das geht been

403
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,950
don't do this dogs to empower challenge
to our shelters the news

404
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:33,190
command prompt go that way instead great
let's be smart about even generate these

405
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,740
words how do we know that he
characterizes the minimum let's look at

406
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,730
some password policies

407
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:44,870
let's be smart about it so how do we get
smart about it we asked for the password

408
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:51,370
policy organization that we're testing
that's like a forbidden rule right you

409
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:59,470
can't ask the company you're trying to
hack for their password policy policy no

410
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:05,230
you have to figure that on your own we
we can figure that out tomorrow we have

411
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,790
access to a system that we pulled
wordless from where did we get the

412
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:15,010
harshest row right Chocolate Rain when
we get that housework password hash list

413
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:20,050
ask the system with their password
policy is super smart about it this

414
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,840
complexity and works great when you
include the complexity of Hazzard like

415
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,910
12 characters create I don't need to do

416
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,530
9 10 and 11 rebounds hurts reduces our
time significantly so how much the

417
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:36,310
village some more if the customer won't
tell you that's the easy way getting

418
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:43,260
herself so on Linux we can look at on
Debian based systems we can look at

419
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:49,420
login not deaths in the directory and it
tells us what the housework also use ok

420
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,290
so in this case we've got a bunch of
stuff about what our password looks like

421
00:40:54,290 --> 00:41:00,530
the minimum like this 12 characters and
we talked about what is what makes up

422
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:07,060
the complexity rules the hell credit at
the you credit and the D credit what

423
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:13,310
does all that mean great number of
points based on the complexity credit

424
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,720
for when you pick complexity rules for
now we can start determining what some

425
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:23,810
of our complexity looks like from our
link system we can also do that for

426
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:28,550
Windows we can get a little bit using
the net accounts but more importantly

427
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:35,090
our show and PowerShell can create all
sorts of good stuff using the eighty

428
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:40,350
default admin password command line and
it will tell us what the defaults are

429
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:45,170
what the current password policy is on
the demand now we can craft a word list

430
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,980
based on what the Active Directory is
telling us about in this case the

431
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,820
lockout threshold is five attempts at
minimum password length is 7 characters

432
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:01,520
and last 14 characters are yous and
complexity of the table

433
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,210
chances are complexity enables gonna be
what a whore so uppercase lowercase

434
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,960
number and special card so we can we can
now make some good judgments about what

435
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:21,930
would you do 400 rules at a rate of
course right now I'm busy gonna do

436
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:28,880
something out for now hold on right yeah
so hows cat is totally awesome for some

437
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,170
of the stuff doing brute force attacks
straightener supports attacks that works

438
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,120
great but you spend hours months days
waiting hearse to finish let's use that

439
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,980
word was to be really smart about it
it's also great for doing masks attacks

440
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,540
take our word list and apricot
additional roles to it and got some

441
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:53,920
great examples so for example you can
observe passwords were something maybe

442
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,850
you see them on post-it notes maybe
you're doing some assessment work for

443
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:02,250
some wireless stuff and they're using
the verizon mifi ice or something on the

444
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:07,210
leg when they have to fall credentials
from the manufacture and they're all

445
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:12,000
based on a specific pattern so good
observed patterns in the organization is

446
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,210
becomes awesome especially if they don't
change the defaults and they leave it

447
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:22,090
based on the sticker on the matter on
the back so now we observe the patterns

448
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:26,250
final with a minimum household is find
out what the maximum length is let's

449
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:31,660
look at how they structure those
patterns for example go to the Verizon

450
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,400
store and when do you start every rising
star you go into even if you don't need

451
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:44,300
to hear the ball go there but why
nothing startling find your friends

452
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:50,020
there's start building a collection of
what those passwords look like and in

453
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,910
this case we have even have some stuff
publicly available

454
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,600
MAC addresses available in the clear
with a monitor wireless card and monitor

455
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,720
mode so we can start grabbing MAC
addresses and even understanding what

456
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,760
somebody's house heard portions were
quite so this was a little bit outside

457
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,270
case we can observe some of that stuff
in plain text in this case where the

458
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:16,930
verizon mifi self the passwords are all
the same format they start with mobile

459
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:19,660
with a capital

460
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,750
four characters last 4 characters of the
MAC address which we can observe the

461
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:32,440
plane to him claim tax he dashed and
then six random numbers we now have a

462
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:41,240
pattern so wishes known portions
possible one separator and then six

463
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:50,059
random numbers that has a 17 character
password where's the entropy is not a

464
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:55,460
lot there's ten characters event for the
back of dress which really doesn't

465
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:01,549
become entropy because we have observed
so six characters are entered but we can

466
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:07,579
be really dumb about passwords with
eccentric so choosing the method for

467
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:12,160
some of this guessing the entropy is
really helpful thinking about how we do

468
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,880
password masking with hash cap righties
is important so think about this one so

469
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,170
the first options work with either has
kind of sealaska we take the unknown

470
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:32,339
hash for this this wireless network and
we know that mobile capital m is the

471
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:36,029
first person password based on the
pattern that we know that the next four

472
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:40,430
characters elastic or the MAC address
which we can observe so we know those

473
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:47,510
and then followed by a dash great we can
now guess the next six digits so replace

474
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:56,049
the password going to guess with global
ed for the dash for the loan portion and

475
00:45:56,049 --> 00:46:01,440
then you did it with this currently the
first example at the top of the slide

476
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:10,109
that will guess passwords or mobile Edme
dash from 0 to 99999 but we've observed

477
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:15,829
passwords they never are as one america
their number two numeric characters

478
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:23,130
they're never 345 always six so we've
wasted a bunch of time testing between

479
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,210
one American actor

480
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:32,109
and six America be smart about it so
with a second example you're setting the

481
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:38,089
maximum password minimum length to 17
characters 17 characters will be

482
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:44,890
observed as the example so start there
don't test for mobile Edme dash 0

483
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,070
because it will never be that housework
based on what we hope there will always

484
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:56,119
be six characters not 12345 so start at
six characters set the maximum length so

485
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:05,609
we add the dash dash dash aww man says
17 so now instead of testing 012345 all

486
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:12,720
the way up to 999 you will start at 60
my gosh we just took like an hour out of

487
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:28,240
our password which are right time I'm
sorry she lied but the mexicana parks

488
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,010
and nobody showed up as you know what
you guys all showed up thank you guys

489
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:38,740
are awesome thank you for coming to work
on this is one of my favorite so I could

490
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:42,750
probably go on and on and on and on
about the stuff but one to give you guys

491
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:47,010
some of the the basics to get started
and start building your own methodology

492
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:52,040
give you guys a pace has quite honestly
that was the part that was the hardest

493
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,760
for me to figure out what what how to
get started in this great I've got a

494
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,000
tool and I've got a password cracking
now what

495
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,619
so with that I want to give you guys
some peace and love to hear feedback and

496
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:10,770
let me hear what works for you guys and
quite honestly I'm shocked how well

497
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:16,589
wordless work it is also one they're
they're small they're taxed proper

498
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:19,650
driver burtless but we've been when
you're done

499
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:24,450
base because they're gonna be different
because this is a completely complex

500
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:28,560
problem we can go on and on and on we
can throw money at the suits the

501
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,160
situation

502
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,450
money's not always the answer no money
can't buy you happiness now yes it can

503
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:41,599
money can buy me things that make me
happy from humans other and otherwise

504
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,109
would be wrong

505
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:51,539
alright so this is what works for me I'd
love to hear more from you folks we can

506
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:56,430
use those worthless Great Bridge on the
River without a GPU would apply the same

507
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:01,680
methodologies do something with a GPU
why the GPU will just take that weren't

508
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,910
wasn't ugly those hashes so much faster
but you may not always have access to do

509
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:16,049
so based on applying it to multiple
technologies is also so with that thank

510
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:20,890
you thank you very much a promise more
spider-man me nobody else loves you like

511
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:28,150
I do

512
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:39,770
whatever oh sorry there was one of the
spider-man yeah yeah if you want to see

513
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:45,609
some of the other bad spiderman games
hit me afterwards outside cuz I want to

514
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:51,740
share that was some of the really bad
they're they're also so seriously go see

515
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:58,960
even mock he's on track for to see how
you can start using password cracking

516
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,369
Greeks were for passwords and he's got
epic set up so seriously a great fall on

517
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:07,869
talking it just happened to be time when
so thank you very much I hope you had

518
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:12,160
fun at her question

519
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,539
oh by the way and guard against if
you're an awesome Hester and you have

520
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:22,690
really good writing skills we're hiring

521
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:28,549
we want you seriously not comes come see
us afterwards we have a booth outside

522
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:34,789
come see me we'd love to talk to you
yeah awesome place to work
