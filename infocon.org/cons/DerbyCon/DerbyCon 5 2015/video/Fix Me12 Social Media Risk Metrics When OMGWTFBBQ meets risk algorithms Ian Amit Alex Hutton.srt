talk about though and obnoxious even
better

4
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,770
good so welcome to social media
RiskMetrics my name's Alex sudden I

5
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,060
currently work for a systemically
important financial institution that

6
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,360
were made me unless there I'm in charge
of security intelligence response

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,900
briefly about trying to target somebody
else take these things very hostile

8
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:25,049
vulnerability management and red teaming
as well as larger C function and that's

9
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,710
kind of what I do I worked for a company
called Verizon one-sided some risk tough

10
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,240
ones etc

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:48,900
intimated currently work at social media
company stuff media or

12
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:59,410
do computer stuff and whenever you can
finally we're on social media that we

13
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,440
both have Twitter accounts which makes
our social media experts qualifies us to

14
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:16,450
to do this talk for a second so
basically what you're looking at a flame

15
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,830
work we kinda came up live to figure out
if you have individuals with online

16
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,840
presences that may introduce risk to
themselves or your organization and

17
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,760
other words it's a model for seeing if
somebody's being a dipshit online mainly

18
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,310
executives your third party suppliers
your I T person with the keys to the

19
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,930
kingdom consultants basically anyone
that has any kind of effect and access

20
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:53,730
to your assets I said Asus assets in the
organization so next question will why

21
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,870
why do we want us there might be a
couple reasons I'll bring out since you

22
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,610
know there's this thing called the DIR
I'll bring out a couple of highlights

23
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,440
for you

24
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,890
Tristan happens to be kind of a big
still that's right people will not start

25
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,459
clicking on stuff and it doesn't take a
rocket surgeon to figure out that if you

26
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,739
are kind of a jerk online maybe somebody
might figure out how to fish year right

27
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,600
and this could be bad

28
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:29,110
ok because basically people click on
attachments years of research that they

29
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,790
still well and ill and this can be
significant in terms of the common

30
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,040
patterns we see about how organizations
and over and over and over again I'm

31
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,850
just gonna bring up cyber espionage as
one of the ways that we see this over

32
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,690
and over and over again and common
patterns now specifically because

33
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,819
there's a huge shift

34
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,019
in terms of fishing or successful
phishing attacks from traditional email

35
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,510
which has a lot of controls over it and
it's filtered and people are like

36
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,959
trained not to collection on emails
towards social media attacks which are

37
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,959
much more targeted more personalized way
more interactive profile I mean it's

38
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,909
like you're talking to someone so that
makes it very legitimate it's like your

39
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,030
social like your social

40
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:25,750
samples of impact of it tweet or or you
know the repercussions

41
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:33,610
anyone remember this lovely girl Justin
Saka those who don't remember just as a

42
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:40,680
PR person who shortly before boarding a
flight to Africa to South Africa tweeted

43
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:50,320
this going to Africa get aids just
kidding white people that my sound and

44
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,380
we're going we're not judging as racist
funny hilarious you know if it's

45
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,599
somewhere in that range

46
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:04,289
justine boarded her flight didn't get
the Gogo Inflight wifi and during that

47
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:08,940
flight that sweet kind of exploded she
started with a Twitter account which had

48
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,840
like $200 less than 200 followers when
she got on the plane during her flight

49
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,720
as I said that we'd win kind of viral
and win if we were even start listing

50
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,150
where and when she landed she was
already a celebrity without even

51
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,860
realizing that she was the moment she
landed in the airport someone snapped a

52
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,590
picture and that's basically what you
find out found out what happened and

53
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:44,080
that she was fired and it didn't just
and with her being fired and her

54
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,080
employer going like okay so we got a
little PR thing here

55
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,520
guys in an airport taking pictures or it
got very very personal like death

56
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,129
threats and

57
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:00,929
and very physical threats to her her
life obviously someone with a track

58
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:03,949
record like that on social media is
gonna have a little bit of a hard time

59
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:11,009
getting another job which again was the
case for Justine and Thursday remember

60
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,179
where or or have to link for it but you
can find it online

61
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:19,729
covering that kind of you know a public
shaming the social media thing and

62
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:24,979
really focused on her story and
aftermath years after its she's she's

63
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:57,520
pretty fucked up still and

64
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:33,639
it's really warm ok you know that's good
so there's a slight aftertaste of

65
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:52,710
nuttiness

66
00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:01,469
every that has people working for them
or has some kind of presence online is

67
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:06,979
affected by the US financial services
manufacturing technology

68
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:14,199
everyone and don't even start with oh we
don't allow social media organization

69
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,199
that's bullshit it doesn't it's a lie
right you're full of shit if you say

70
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,819
that even if you say no we control
social media because we have to you know

71
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:30,159
passed this by XYZ yeah right people
have Twitter accounts facebook account

72
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:35,579
linkedin accounts you can't it's their
lives that's right that's right so so

73
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:40,909
why do you want this organization may or
may not be doing things that everybody

74
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:49,110
agrees with your next reason for why do
you wanna do this some people may

75
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,339
recognize this gentleman

76
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,830
yeah we're not going

77
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:03,610
whatever cause I can't pronounce after
this drink enough water with you know

78
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:11,350
this guy on the last week he went on
somebody basically challenged on the

79
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,550
markup of one of his age drugs and he
went on inside it was fair

80
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:25,540
his mark up and basically things
happened all the negative PR that ensued

81
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,190
a cause them to drop the price of the
drug on a personal level i think is

82
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:38,000
great but the investor stones but above
the that the hacker known as four

83
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:57,230
chan.org so basically what you're
getting out of RiskMetrics framework

84
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:03,200
like this is the ability to build some
scorecard to track that you know elusive

85
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,150
risk with some form of a number of a
school or the represents you know me vs

86
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:17,510
Alex in terms of our potential impact to
our organization's ability to drill down

87
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,900
into their behaviors that contribute to
my personal analysis personal everyone's

88
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,570
personal risk or in order to make
adjustments if needed and those are

89
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,650
going to be very very clear insurance
off their contribution or effect on

90
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:41,180
those on those elements again the final
goal is to get a grasp on how risky is

91
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:47,120
individual acts organization and again
my organization we're going to talk a

92
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,740
lot about biases and kinda factoring in
the right context and what do I need to

93
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,800
do or what can I do in order to mitigate
some of those risks and introduced him I

94
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,970
mean I just wanna say as the

95
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,639
as someone who has the pleasure working
with some really great as intolerant I

96
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,209
just see this as a potential natural
extension of our program we're going to

97
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:18,180
be interested in other news and
information as an organization why am I

98
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,199
not interested in what my organization's
leadership looks like what their

99
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,720
exposure is right as well as maybe
people like I don't know people like

100
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,339
private bankers who may have the
responsibility of your working with the

101
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:45,129
fortunes of some very wealthy people so
how does this work from alex says it

102
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:50,970
couldn't be seen this this is kind of
cool stuff basically these four people

103
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:58,899
huge to use over in germany it's
horrible terrible the burbs like what

104
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:07,360
they wanted to do is they wanted to
basically create Twitter it's okay for

105
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:19,100
the first line to move one back because
it's fine for sentiment analysis around

106
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,420
the German elections kind of a little
bit of groundbreaking work and what they

107
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,670
basically did was we had a handful of
factors that you'll see in this

108
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,819
beautiful spider charts by the way
anybody you spider charts the demo

109
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,750
honest-to-goodness I hate these things

110
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:44,069
islands in the stream so but this one is
really good at this point because it's

111
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:51,389
showing you of things that they wanted
to get sentiment around was it money or

112
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:56,019
you know were they talking about the
future of the talk a lot about the past

113
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:01,500
right there where they goin positive or
negative right weird to see a big hall

114
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,290
and positive for a different country
right considering what we're about

115
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:13,570
witness over the next 12 months plus as
well as some about what their tone was

116
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:19,300
right like sadness anxiety and so forth
so this is not a call and basically

117
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,790
they're positive that if people are
tweeting about these people giving the

118
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:32,589
sentiment right then you can protect to
some degree what the big issues are what

119
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:36,040
people want to see and so on and so
forth so

120
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,490
sentiment analysis but they had it's
important so that they had goals right

121
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:51,740
in terms of doing this not as anybody
used force tracks so if you if you

122
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:58,089
haven't this is this is actually
something that I use a lot of due to

123
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:03,509
their workshops on this but it's
essentially a software development

124
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,399
metric based on that drug that was
developed by the stunning victory silly

125
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:13,389
and that's basically figures out the US
will have goals in life it's nice to

126
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:19,360
have goals we all have a goal that we
want to measure then the next logical

127
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,940
thing in this kind of metric Parmer
process to ask questions about how

128
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:35,670
langevin hitting we're missing that goal
so I finally once you have some really

129
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:42,410
good question now you look for some
metrics right now look to see if you've

130
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:48,089
got indicators not direct answers like
oh this metric clearly answers the

131
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:53,860
question per se but a lead indicator to
that might suggest that you're able to

132
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,480
do that so you see here kind of a
logical model goal question that trick

133
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:05,329
sometimes the same question will the
multiple goals real brief example for

134
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:10,089
you that we might all relate to patch
management using gchat to create a patch

135
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:11,310
management scorecard

136
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,120
when I have to talk to I T about patch
management I want to make sure that are

137
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,790
patching is comprehensive no patch left
behind

138
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,970
I need to make sure that is timely right
in the third thing is is a cost

139
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,570
efficient so I can ask myself questions
around you know about comprehensive in

140
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,890
my car and my business units covering
operating systems about covering systems

141
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,560
by rest so on and so forth and then I
can go get that data right it may not be

142
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:49,870
just raw nuts poser right but I can't
take that data and combined with other

143
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:55,810
data like i dont no charges were charged
in business units are and so forth

144
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:03,010
answers that I need this is the time we
won as a cost effective writing search

145
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,460
using le expressions and risk registers
and so forth so that's a little bit

146
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,230
about gchat when how you might use it on
your own scorecards for organizations

147
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,970
let's talk about how we use them for
this so we started with a simple goals

148
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:28,670
that scorecard perspective we need to
understand how risky a person is we need

149
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:34,720
to ask questions like you know how those
ones activity in the likelihood or the

150
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,420
impact of perceived or potential threat
what kind of meetings are are being used

151
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,490
in terms of those communication how you
track them and we ended up with

152
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,470
providing as far as metrics a
qualitative approach rather than the

153
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,660
quantitative one which is kind of a lie
because you know I started with

154
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:09,770
quantitative you know why he'll tell
codes of fear and ended up moving

155
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,829
towards a qualitative with a little bit
of quantitative in it so mad as hard a

156
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:21,360
map is extremely hard and these this was
our set of goals and again we're

157
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,240
releasing them as part of the tool that
afterwards

158
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,500
very very simply measurable way to
quantify risk with an online version

159
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:38,860
broken-down qualifying and working with
third parties which is as important ok

160
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,080
and it easy to measure because
everyone's online and talking shit and

161
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,659
opposing everything

162
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:49,059
critic score from executives so I can
reflected back to them and tell them

163
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,159
look your effect you have the potential
to affect my stock's value for your

164
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:58,179
stock value shareholder whatever it is
if you talk like this that alright shut

165
00:17:58,179 --> 00:17:59,100
it down

166
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,020
lock down your account make it private
and and and and again and provide those

167
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:13,179
suggestions based on the jury of factors
to the risk score that found in our goal

168
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:17,929
was to get a metric that would apply
across the industry so if I'm trying to

169
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,390
compare my organization to another 12 I
want to be you know as soon as they are

170
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,159
insurance obviously mean race and
managing risk do I want to be you know

171
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:32,640
my better than them and i can you know
bank on it in terms of my competitive

172
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,220
posture and I think that's where part
you gotta see this only do a little bit

173
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,140
of sentiment analysis later the power of
nursing program to go to your executives

174
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,870
in your marketing and say here's how our
messages are the interviews that we do

175
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:56,809
in our messages are being interpreted by
the listener hears the messages across

176
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:03,230
social media and all channels for our
competitors are being interpreted if

177
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,760
we're more angry than they are is that
really what we want maybe it is maybe

178
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,570
it's not hurting us is is it helping us
again the goal is to provide a metric

179
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,320
that you can measure over time and see
the effect of different roles and

180
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:28,010
activities and onto my mapping this
purposely a notch are again and my map

181
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,730
is gonna be released are gonna have the
link on on

182
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:36,960
the social media's right after this talk
so you can make it happen change it

183
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:47,049
destroyed crater on whatever is needed
you is that would help improve the

184
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:52,549
management to to take those three main
elements right is a individual risky is

185
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:58,830
a third-party risky right and is my
rendition of our social media behaviors

186
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,520
and start breaking it down so we're
looking at the basic elements like

187
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,960
likelihood and impact see what effects
the likelihood right in terms of a

188
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,820
threat vector in the form of activism
and did you break down activism into

189
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:22,140
politics and economics and religion and
sports and so on so forth and I'm gonna

190
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,320
elaborate too much because we're gonna
have a lot of fun when we pop Excel and

191
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,400
we did the same thing for impact what
kind of impact is gonna be assumed from

192
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,360
those things and and the qualitative

193
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:45,169
part of it is basically once you reach a
leave right it's an on and off to go to

194
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:51,440
create kind of its Christmas tree that
you can turn on and off and leaves and

195
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,540
that's gonna be mapped back into the
record at 20 percent in in a few minutes

196
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:07,510
and we also took into account while I
can see here

197
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:15,710
into account impact talk about war and
sanctions on sanctions presence online

198
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:24,450
like impersonators and fraud accounts
and parody accounts my potential risk

199
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,690
any person need to have major impact
especially if that person does not have

200
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:38,850
official presence mine I pretend to be a
company I can affect their stock price

201
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,480
by saying you know self-doubt and if you
don't like what we do for its patient's

202
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,260
way jews you only give her children's
leukemia or something so the next

203
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,560
tranche obviously is not published
information so it's gonna be stuff like

204
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,550
published on self published information
so it's going to be the sentiment

205
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,660
analysis that we can scraping gather
what maybe reactions to the tweets that

206
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:14,040
maybe information about those people
themselves like for example would take

207
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,250
the jostling sacco case she's all over
her she's all over New York Times and so

208
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,840
on and so forth and so there's an
element of that where you can do

209
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:32,520
analysis there and said tape clearly the
Republic analysis and things that we

210
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:39,850
might call traditional journalism is
also has some sentiment and again we put

211
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,870
biases or or weights are different for
let's say if you get to the new york

212
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:53,640
times different site rash on my block
are reaches its almost there but I

213
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,110
reaches a little different potential
impact so we have to factor that into

214
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:04,700
the model you can take that into account
and wait you're you're in terms of their

215
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,440
approach as I said before we went for

216
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,669
for qualitative we are measuring
essential at the end of the day we're

217
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:17,100
trying to get to it you know something
between 20 and the 10 alright so it's

218
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:23,610
kind of a a percentage in terms of
likelihood and impact and we tried

219
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,980
several approaches in terms of
aggregating the different elements and

220
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,779
that's not going to work

221
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:34,549
average doesn't really take into account
the highs and lows just taking the

222
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:38,149
highest doesn't take into account alone
that have additional contributing

223
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:44,659
factors and so came up with with an
additional jewellery let's say wing

224
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:52,480
system that looks at three men buckets
of activity and provides you you know X

225
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,769
amount of points to distribute those
buckets based on your organization's

226
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:02,509
sensitivity and it's actually getting
some like that all right you've got

227
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:09,059
fifty points 22 score threat types and
insurance fraud espionage error and the

228
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,399
different types of activism and every
organization is going to have a

229
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:18,730
different weight or even every person's
don't have a different waiting for the

230
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:24,110
kind of threats debt that I'm concerned
about right that makes this relevant and

231
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:29,090
that makes the score very defensible
insurance of you know you're presenting

232
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,909
this back to management oh by the way
this is taking from previous email I

233
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:36,990
sent you when I talk to you about you
know mr CEO how do you perceive the risk

234
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,090
I'm going to take their you know their
biases or their weights and apply to my

235
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:50,169
model something back to them and saying
magic and the end result that we

236
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:55,970
currently have in terms of scorecards
provide you with four elements with four

237
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:03,009
scoring elements likelihood
manifestation impact and element yet to

238
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,509
be named because it's

239
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:12,009
factor of number of of the ordinance
number of instances potential threats

240
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:12,979
online

241
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:18,519
factored with kind of medium through
which the effect right if you remember

242
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,329
the last branch on that mind map it was
you know mostly concerned about what

243
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:27,659
media's are are are these threats
manifesting themselves off again New

244
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,929
York Times blog Twitter whatever it is
we have different weights for those to

245
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:37,389
factor into the number that we're gonna
see I wanted to call that metric he

246
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:43,269
unleashes but he be done it in mexico
and now obviously you're gonna have to

247
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:49,039
collect more data to to base your you
know you're checking on and off those

248
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,139
leaves and and plugging some numbers
into that

249
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:58,719
so this is the kind of the first of all
context how big is your organization how

250
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:03,769
many people and organizations are being
tracked or or mi monitoring their

251
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:08,849
activity online what's the size of the
management right again that's going to

252
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:12,940
provide me some kind of measure
insurance of you know I have a hundred

253
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,739
people organization and twenty people
management group that's a little

254
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:24,289
different than 10,000 people transition
with you know twenty people management

255
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:30,979
so that those biases factory in and give
you context to the kind of risk cuz when

256
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:37,119
I look at an executive in a look at a
late person right or or normal situation

257
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,399
their risk score is going to change
based on that bias that management too

258
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,229
or size bias

259
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:49,190
looking at locality right on talking
about one office in person officer isn't

260
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,289
couple people around or am I talking
about the band that spans several states

261
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:57,639
and has headquarters and and and offices
all around

262
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:00,949
chatter this is kind of the main element

263
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:07,690
everything that is being spewed online
by their organization the visuals that

264
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:14,169
we're tracking any conversation that
discusses that person that asset alright

265
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:15,509
and he mentions

266
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:23,589
any competition that that person has out
outside like you know the public all of

267
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:30,789
that shattered to be collected and
measured in allies in order to impose

268
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:33,389
this description this metric

269
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:39,549
impersonators again fairly easy to
identify all right honey IANS out there

270
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:43,679
up there right now on LinkedIn there to
a very poor job I know if you're here

271
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:51,239
later for free class on how to create a
pretty damn good person eric is dis shit

272
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:57,789
and you're not responding whether you
are I'm sending you emails reply I'm

273
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,969
more than willing to help this is this
is embarrassing and identified

274
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:07,679
impersonators identify with order you
know militias whether they're just you

275
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,209
know kind of squatting on that name on G
plus or whatever it is

276
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:15,249
order parody accounts again from a risk
perspective they're gonna get different

277
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:21,399
scores based on their behavior last but
not least 24 sentiment analysis this is

278
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:26,609
what's gonna give us a lot of context to
the way that people communicate about

279
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:31,619
your assets in the way that your assets
are communicating works outside in terms

280
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:40,700
of enticing threats or or or identifying
potential threatening messages towards

281
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:47,129
you or your assets so let's talk about
how you can do this like I said earlier

282
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:54,029
I see this as a natural extension of
innocent so let's let's get the rubber

283
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:59,969
meets the road for a second so basically
if you determine whether or not do this

284
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:04,319
like you're gonna have to have
conversations with legal and a child's

285
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:10,729
mother folks and I i as i cn basically
four different responses the first now

286
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:15,589
that's right decisions tell you
something about their risk tolerance

287
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:21,929
just by saying no it's not it's not an
immediate shutdown or should be seen as

288
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:28,309
they don't care a second is okay well
we're not going to necessarily have

289
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:33,229
cooperation but you can do this might be
nice to do this for just publicly about

290
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:39,089
one million depending on how did you get
and what the conversation you have you

291
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:45,659
might get into volitional well let's ask
the CEO's let's ask different people if

292
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:51,329
there are going to be ok we're
participating in the US program and I'm

293
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:57,179
last be enforced it's going to be like
sluts a your workings journey for

294
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,609
celebrity you might enforce this sort of
thing and another man that most

295
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:06,029
executives already used to their privacy
being taken away automatically by swift

296
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:10,299
action so that's that's actually fairly
easy sell based on my experience you're

297
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:13,899
just telling them here there's a new
tool that's going to prevent your Dick's

298
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:18,290
picks from showing up online they're
gonna go like right on I like you

299
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,460
only Anthony

300
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,620
the next thing is determine who writes
once you get by in on this apology part

301
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,280
of the same conversation by Annan are we
gonna be able to do this or not or to

302
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,360
what degree are we going to do this
figure it out right my privilege I T

303
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,560
users like that's my goal I just have to
use their great people that I work with

304
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:54,890
on the other hand phishing attacks them
makes minor 2nd obvious goal is

305
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:01,430
executives and board members marketing
PR people as well depending on the

306
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:10,010
nature of who you are and what you do
sales people there's a call so there's

307
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,460
there's a great story that a member of
the security architecture arquitectura

308
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,690
defense industrial base organization in
the United States tells about their

309
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:26,350
sales people going to France and this is
years ago right and so they gotta France

310
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,890
show up very tired after their national
flight again invited for a wine and

311
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,510
cheese tasting so sure enough they go
you know kind of freshen up and go back

312
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,420
downstairs but they're so tired that
they leave early

313
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:45,760
announced they got back to their hotel
room they're hard drives apparently

314
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,970
somebody made off with it and have time
like copy and still all that stuff the

315
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:53,950
hard drugs is gone you know it's this
sort of it's this sort of

316
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:59,010
cyber-espionage that means a salesperson
might actually have information in this

317
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:04,710
case there were pricing spreadsheet
surround large large let's call it did

318
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:10,320
sales that we're now in the hands the
French government so salespeople can be

319
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,280
a target to determine where you're gonna
profile them the sides websites blog

320
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,770
comments 0 if you want more information
about how to be really sharp about this

321
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,390
there happens to be a great new book out
with the authors that might actually be

322
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,490
here not just endured

323
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:42,500
one of them in the room I just as a
great but we also it's a really great

324
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,540
creative ways to figure out how you're
going to find information on people but

325
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,530
what they're doing and why how they
might be creating some exposures by my

326
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:56,809
generalized kind of turn 4 where are we
gonna look is anywhere we're your

327
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:03,820
identity online it could be you know it
could be obvious Facebook profile but it

328
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:11,350
could also be an Amazon review on you
know the vibrator under 3000 which you

329
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:16,270
know kind of breed you read comments on
and you know that impacts your

330
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:26,460
perception and action so that actually
collect all the things for those who

331
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,640
millet it's more like script transform
the load that's fine and you'll be

332
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,260
performing analysis postscript or if
you're really clever you can all there's

333
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:43,670
already heard and examples out there for
like Twitter's API patchy storm brought

334
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:50,929
it on her golden but spread you know
just a basic example of a trolling

335
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,620
account saying here which is more
dangerous

336
00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:00,470
shutting down a car or having
nationalist generous rhetoric right so

337
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,160
this turns out to that obviously you can
do sentiment analysis on some of that by

338
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:11,320
dropping some of the crazy stuff not
saying store the data

339
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,320
whatever you want now marcus rain will
tell you but due to be due to data

340
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:23,240
that's fine you can use a little bit at
mongos our friend etcetera

341
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,450
the next step is gonna be analysis
you're basically have two is that you're

342
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:32,730
going to do to your analysis even doing
what will call Amish handcrafted when

343
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:38,290
should you know basically you have
people of any people who are doing the

344
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:42,540
analysis for you thanks to you as much
would say the magic of

345
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:49,240
duda we could do machine learning right
so I miss handcrafted you're basically

346
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,620
gonna take a look at the information
that comes in front of you and you'll

347
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:58,310
basically score the comments this looks
bad this looks good maybe you lose some

348
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:04,750
some other online tools to help you out
without we've got one in the second and

349
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,210
there are some links here

350
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:13,540
yourself now typically not have talked
about risk to a lot of clothes and

351
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,450
people in our industry tend to get
freaked out about subjective analysis

352
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:23,160
even though we do it all the time it's
okay I promise this is going to be more

353
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,740
meaningful because least you don't have
to be perfect all you have to do is

354
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,750
cause the conversation happen to say hey
when you tweet about the st. Louis

355
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:39,200
Cardinals vs Chicago Cubs Alex he had
negative responses and people are happy

356
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,520
is that really necessary

357
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,280
Boston right before you know you're
going to Chicago and you're talking to

358
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,770
people who might be customers whether it
would be so it's it's sentiment analysis

359
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,390
can be your friends

360
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:58,410
brief exempt about how can do this
handcrafted way using a free online tool

361
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:06,780
so which one of her friends a long
speech don't worry announced that he's

362
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,130
running for president got over six
thousand words and it's actually based

363
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:20,740
on you not like written up most of its
written but when he comes in stages box

364
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:27,360
goes off script so I don't imagine what
is your group is but whatever so you can

365
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:35,700
plug into one of those tools Watson has
a free open-source plug that end and you

366
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:43,210
get this right is 16% social

367
00:36:43,210 --> 00:37:26,080
God

368
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:34,240
insurance that that were received or
allies

369
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:48,240
it's pretty fairly aggressive he's an
angry angry now it's fairly accurate i

370
00:37:48,240 --> 00:38:42,650
mean not getting into political analysis
but it's interesting to do this

371
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:55,000
on top of that which are the same text
gives you a breakdown of what kind of

372
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:09,510
personnel he's being perceived by IBM's
Watson truck that gets him this alright

373
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:18,630
poster is confident you know doesn't
care about our ads which I did it I can

374
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:25,460
see how that works and then get the full
breakdown different elements under like

375
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:31,270
the the big five elements and all data
analysis so again it doesn't have to be

376
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,240
accurate

377
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,810
doesn't have to be right subjective you
don't give a shit

378
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:42,190
the only thing it needs is consistent
rights to take the same text running

379
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:47,590
through it alright gotta bring you the
same results change the text bring

380
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,910
different results at least have some
kind of consistent metrics that you can

381
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:59,910
say I can see the change if you know
some of those sentences that's just one

382
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:07,050
example if you are going to try and do
this yourself just kind of not so that's

383
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:14,530
a graphic better now there's another
there's another option which is code

384
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,080
some stuff up so this comes from the
breaking through analysis and it's on

385
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,260
the slides that you click the link I
promise it's not a breakthrough analysis

386
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,940
dot com blog and a handful of these
natural processing tools that you can

387
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,760
implement yourself everything from Mike
pie fun talk it's an obviously there's

388
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,980
there's a passion structure stuff stuff
coming out a stand for laying pipe and

389
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,630
so forth

390
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:48,580
this sort of machine learning job is the
beginning programmers for data

391
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,540
scientists coming out of university

392
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:56,590
so our local program we've interviewed
folks to come in and be data scientists

393
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,080
will teach them security about you know
handle our our sets and so forth and are

394
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,640
already coming in with the ability to do
this and hugs the soft and so forth like

395
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,510
their graduate program so there's lots
of information out there that you can do

396
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:15,860
this and not only can actually strain
automatic do the big Gator saying and

397
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,490
get some information on the other side
again this is not going to turn into a

398
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:25,320
religion argument though this approach
is better that's bullshit pick one make

399
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,360
sure it's consistent and run through it
was right there with nobody's problem

400
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,640
primarily people are doing us with
information spirit or physical security

401
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,240
standpoint so we put it out there so
last thing that you can do is run with a

402
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,660
scorecard and again remember we're gonna
give you numbers those aren't as

403
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,800
important unless you're comparing two
different folks are three different

404
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,600
folks as it is to be able to look at a
factor and say you know you're talking a

405
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:01,210
lot about search social politics here
very angry tone that conversation may

406
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:06,050
not be stopped it and maybe they are you
aware that you sound angry online and

407
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:14,290
your tweet and the person that's because
I agree I didn't know I was that good

408
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,840
and they may think about how they write
and present themselves but at the end of

409
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,680
the day you've implemented a behavioral
control that will reduce risk to some

410
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:28,580
degree and and really the end goal here
is to be able to provide you with ways

411
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,770
to reduce the risk

412
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:34,460
ok those can be technological they can
be behavioral like you know saddam her

413
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,870
talk of a dude shut the fuck up right
and they can be other compensating

414
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:43,820
controls again where insecurity it
doesn't mean that everything has to be

415
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:49,120
technical I saw that everything has to
be technical you can have company

416
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,680
controls like legal right

417
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,310
scientists piece of paper every time you
know you as my third party supply every

418
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:01,300
time you mention my company you only
$20,000

419
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,710
right it could be financial hedging on
you know I'm gonna be at your end here

420
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:13,060
could be buying insurance alright I have
an idiot CEO I'm gonna need to increase

421
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:19,430
my insurance because he's just stupid
libel person and as you know in

422
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,290
financial you know that the Basel II
framework sets aside reputational risk

423
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:29,860
is the risk category operas folks have
set aside capital to cover that opera

424
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:35,460
ask the sisters you yet another way to
say okay it may or may not make sense of

425
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,470
set-asides and capital because of
somebody does something dumb online like

426
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:45,300
talk about you know a bill that we're
we're producing we may have to have some

427
00:43:45,300 --> 00:44:15,180
cash on hand so let's do the demo we
only have five minutes rated show so I

428
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:20,300
would use the word used automated tool
but when you get into these in a

429
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,720
beautiful cats what they'll do is
they'll have specific languages that are

430
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,610
indicators of that perfect right as a
filing and I say you know I just can't

431
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,820
wait to come up and throw my arms around
you you know that might be interpreted

432
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:40,010
to different they're not perfect but in
general what you're getting is if I can

433
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:50,750
change say aggressive types of towns
it's gonna come across

434
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:58,940
plenty of warm drinks on this is this is
bullshit that were releasing a that's

435
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,830
got fancy math on it

436
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:07,240
not really but I'm gonna do like a quick
run through two different analysis the

437
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:15,310
first was gonna be don't rub the signal
was gonna be the pope 11 alright okay so

438
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:19,620
they all try and the pope are going to
have different priorities in terms of

439
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,350
you know there are three types are gonna
have a lot of economical and political

440
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:29,960
activism associated with that type of
behavior presence on the realities are

441
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,470
going to be ranked like all across the
board and again I refer you back to our

442
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:40,450
in a bucket of 20.2 sure that your
sister does your organization and then

443
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:44,260
influence alright so obviously
financially influences pretty big stock

444
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,480
and then we are in the rest will click
on this one for Trump vs we might think

445
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,480
of this is where in his team for his
financial urges real estate business if

446
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,420
we wanted to be part of his team for his
presidential bid we go to competitive

447
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:08,590
right away and we would you are and then
we go off to other elements that we need

448
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:13,210
to plug in as part of the ocean dumping
talked about so we can be highlighted in

449
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:19,520
yellow areas that you need to to Philly
so org size management locations track

450
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,830
parameters her a variable and the
chatter that we discussed before number

451
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:32,590
of first neighbors for executives and 49
executives even listens and then we

452
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:38,910
basically to keep that in mind map
flattened it and put it in the

453
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,800
spreadsheet that was

454
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:49,140
a lot of work and and then you just need
to check off a one inch yellow box that

455
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,460
corresponds with what you have
identified in your collection again I'm

456
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,790
not gonna pull you through the old old
ones that we mark your for Trump but

457
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,970
obviously

458
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:04,490
economic politics in terms of hacktivism
is a threat that he's motivated

459
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,960
motivating

460
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:13,160
display of wealth yes power yes and so
on and so on so forth for all the

461
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,630
different leads that we've seen in the
in the mind map

462
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,320
plugin all that into this magical
spreadsheet

463
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:28,190
here were in at impact so again marking
off financial access to to enjoy your

464
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:28,660
part

465
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:33,000
property and technology level of
influence is pretty high stock value

466
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,930
lovable blah these numbers comment from
the other cab and a talked about the

467
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,740
dosing collection and the number of
followers in the number of personal

468
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:49,950
accounts were and that number is that
magical number that factors in the

469
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:55,190
instances that you have identified on
line that could be potentially dangerous

470
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,850
with

471
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:04,650
medium through which they may manifest
your ranking major news article major

472
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,040
news articles

473
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:12,200
blogs or social media and thats will
bring you to our lovely scorecard

474
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,700
so you're going to end up with those
four numbers again this is Trump

475
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:22,100
we can see the likelihood that 39 F
stations 543 and we've got that magical

476
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:29,060
unicorn number if you look at the Pope's
scorecard it is completely dif alright

477
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:34,060
the impact is way low manifestation
likely to their way high that number is

478
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:39,590
different in terms of number of threats
that will see online and again that's

479
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:44,080
only based on the numbers that we
plugged and because the pope has way

480
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,170
more religious activism associated with
it

481
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,410
his impact is going to be over
vulnerabilities much more social

482
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:56,070
influence is much more PR again it works
because you can defend it

483
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:08,320
my moms gonna be online and so briefly
how can you help us like a lot of little

484
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,680
projects we do like the nurse yes GTM
stuff like to run this to the society of

485
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:20,070
information risk analysts at the mail
unless they'll host links to both the

486
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:26,170
mind map if you want to look at that as
well lets you download Google

487
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:30,930
spreadsheet and play with that for a
while said modified to improve it

488
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:35,410
join their mailing list and say I think
this early I think it should be changed

489
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:40,030
the VAT people will talk about whether
or not that's a great idea if it is

490
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:45,760
fantastic will change it will put it up
there but at least there will be a

491
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,700
memorial that if you wanna do you know
either the Amish handcrafted or the Big

492
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:56,490
Data Marcus tarannum big Gator approach
he's gonna love me for this then you're

493
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:01,420
at least have CBS file with some
algorithms and their to manipulate and

494
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,380
thank you thanks
