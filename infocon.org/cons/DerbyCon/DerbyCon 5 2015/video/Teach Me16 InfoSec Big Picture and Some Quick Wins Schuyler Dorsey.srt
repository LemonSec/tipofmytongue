1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:26,240
alright I realize the last thing
standing between security professionals

2
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,370
and an open bar so I'll try to cut short
so talk about some in a sec big-picture

3
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,579
items specifically in the SEC teams as
well as some quick Wednesday you can

4
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:45,390
take a look back to the workplace so
little bit of an intro to myself I love

5
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,120
to learn red teaming but I am a blue
team were at heart as an example of that

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,590
I started I T and helped us and for some
reason when I was in helpdesk I stumbled

7
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,070
across the offensive Securities LLC P
course and thought that was a cool idea

8
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,440
to take all I was only you know educated
enough to be working and help desk so I

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,740
had no idea what I was in for his way
over my head but it did open my eyes at

10
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,840
the time to the world of security ever
since then even as working in just I T

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,580
looked at everything from security and
after that was consulting for several

12
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,119
years

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,220
announced eckardt's manager for
Activision Blizzard little bit of a

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,200
shameless plug my blog as rude as the
limit dot com it's not a lot of content

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:34,970
so some recent fun I've been having been
trying to dive back and honey pots been

16
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,340
working a lot with the tango honeypot
intelligence platform it's a really

17
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,630
great platform to workouts actually just
all-rounders uses a lot of

18
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,750
mainly as its kept up really get
actionable intelligence another honeypot

19
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,310
system I've been working with canary by
thinks what isn't designed to generate

20
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,090
intelligence but is so much designed to
just solar you an evil happens for

21
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:08,470
example if it's listening and RDP and
someone has a lot and generate the

22
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,110
canary in the coalmine another small
little tidbit as I've been told quite a

23
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:20,190
bit I resemble this guy I didn't put any
weight into it until I ran into some

24
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,980
uncomfortable situations at the airport
so I just go with it now

25
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:32,610
whatever so as toward I'm sure a lot of
you know my security people running the

26
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,340
same issues where people outside of our
realm don't always take part warning

27
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,349
seriously but I think part of that is
that are warning so the rest of the

28
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,910
world are never escape her own security
echo chamber and the SEC as a whole does

29
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,660
not get a better position there's a good
quote on Twitter while back of something

30
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,000
like a security people ninety percent
but are key to the death of the last ten

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
percent I think it's that last part
that's really holding us back in

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,530
addition this presentation will be about
observations event and the SEC teams how

33
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,120
it works some of their behaviour how to
become better and finally some quick

34
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,410
wins like I mentioned it take back to
the workplace to make your security so

35
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:25,500
some observations consulting and working
with a lot of my peers not only I T vs

36
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,950
security but even within security teams
I often work and Silas so a lot of times

37
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,209
you happen operations team in
architecture and engineering team and

38
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,549
they were completely independently of
each other with very little

39
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,019
communication between them and sometimes
even within operations may have a

40
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,389
forensics team that works completely
independently in addition many companies

41
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:50,190
to lack the necessary visibility to
detect evil even make informed

42
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,230
risk-based

43
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:57,420
Asians on the company's embark down a
disability paths are often blasted with

44
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,590
so many alerts coming from somebody told
it's also possible to tell the signal

45
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,959
from the noise and lastly teams do not
often take the time to fully learn and

46
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,720
understand the tools that they're
deploying in their workplace so they

47
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,150
don't get everything you can out of an
example of the silo I'm like I mentioned

48
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,540
most often there's a split between the
architecture and operations teens and

49
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,350
even within security operations you have
forensics and send response continuous

50
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,440
monitoring and vulnerability stuff on
our ability management scans kinda

51
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,180
depends on your organization and when
you have a lot of teams like this you

52
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,830
end up with three different style was
very little cohesion or synergy between

53
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,620
so just even separate from the
operational standpoint a lot of times

54
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,760
ends up bringing about completely
different tool sets that don't integrate

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,669
so all parts of the security team really
need to align and collaborate layers of

56
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,099
the security program its architecture
team fully grasp the outside and they

57
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,849
can build solutions which include more
efficiency capability for the ops team

58
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:06,630
ops team understands engineering they
can make informed recommendations of

59
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,440
Harding for mediation in addition to
that when the ops team makes

60
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,840
recommendations to take into account the
actual business impact and it's hard to

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,070
really ascertain what the business
impact is unless you have a good

62
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,810
understanding of the actual engineering
find it for example if something's gonna

63
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,039
take a hundred and sixty-eight man hours
for something I'll take a Dallas on

64
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:35,050
business and packet easy to tell which
happened first so kind of an example of

65
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,520
what you can achieve when the operations
team and the architecture engineering

66
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,099
team working together is just consider
this workflow example so that the text

67
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,940
if you want to operate in automating got
your office workflow say you have a

68
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,120
sandbox and solution in place kicks off
an alert download power aware of this

69
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,090
and the report and can actually relate
traffic patterns based on the Mount

70
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,660
Hermon which implements may be
compromised

71
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,880
descendants and a notification in case
or your other friends X platform to

72
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,010
automatically take a cross network image
of the infected machines then following

73
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,440
the image simpson's a message to carbon
black to automatically isolating

74
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,090
infected machines from the network and
blocking MTV 25 hashes related to them

75
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,510
our registers at ticket and answer
response platform which contains the

76
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,370
findings and all the steps so please
take a step back at this and look at it

77
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,480
it's a it's 1 a.m. incident happens in
your system response analysis 8 a.m.

78
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,730
next day here I our team is going to
have a ticket waiting for them with

79
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:44,880
everything that was completed and ninety
percent of their incident response so

80
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,000
this may or may not catch advanced actor
kind of really depends however it does

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,820
lessen the operational burden of your
security team and allows them to really

82
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:04,210
focus on finding so back to the
signal-to-noise lot of teams received so

83
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:10,770
many alerts and find the right one and
the next as an example target had fire I

84
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,530
a place which detected them our what
happened to be one of the alert I didn't

85
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,590
respond to investigate so a lot of this
is actually due to lack of hardening or

86
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,070
perimeter defenses defenses were hard to
prevent a lot of the alerts in first

87
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,520
place for example filtering temp folder
block which we'll get to that more later

88
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,349
so the main goal and that's that
everyone should take away you must be

89
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,289
able to stop the bad actors who aren't
even try before you can hope to find the

90
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,379
ones who are actually trying if you're
dealing with a hundred malware let's

91
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:52,379
hope that you would actually find apt
some other observation is a lot of teams

92
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:57,789
are soldiers implementing blinking boxes
as opposed to realize realizing or

93
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,039
having a goal in mind of what they're
trying to do so by anything kind of sit

94
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,909
back and think about what you're trying
to accomplish what is it you're trying

95
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:10,470
to stop what part of the kill chain are
you actually trying to prevent in

96
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,460
addition actually operationalizing the
item is part of the discussion up then

97
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,590
do a lot of companies where they will
end its animal or cyber threat

98
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,090
intelligence and actually
operationalizing it wasn't part of the

99
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,819
discussion once they got the engineering
part is all done in place there are kind

100
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,219
of like you know what now they didn't
have any work clothes built around it

101
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:36,909
didn't have any idea how to get good use
specially in CT I had a positive worry

102
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,800
threat intelligence but not a whole lot
you know operationally that they were

103
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,800
doing what they could do it so in
addition to spend time early learning

104
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,140
all the tools and the options you can do
it that way to think about it from a

105
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,800
hacker perspective so when you configure
it whichever way you do try to think

106
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,450
what ways are there to get away get
around it and we're going to look at a

107
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:06,380
specific example of why this would
benefit us so I'm sure everyone from the

108
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:12,470
sandbox same boxing but just kind of
highlight overview so we're on the same

109
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:18,130
page of the ideas you have a device that
your perimeter that requires also coming

110
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,740
in and out of network and it doesn't
recognize based on the hash it runs

111
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,480
Windows 7 or Windows XP watches behavior
determine if its malicious and if it's

112
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,339
found to be malicious it'll create a
signature as well send you a full report

113
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,320
back saying hey this Mauer was
downloaded here's everything in our did

114
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,840
and why we think it was Mauer

115
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:46,570
our earlier than 2015 sandbox evasion
techniques came out good post about it

116
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,920
what they were doing was basically
checking to see if the virtual machine

117
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,150
had less than to see virtual CPU because
in these big cloud environments like

118
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,430
wildfire fire I since I have to scale of
such a degree every virtual machine is

119
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,250
configured with one CPU so what they
found out as if they just told them not

120
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,440
to not to run it only had one CPU they
were able to bypass these defenses if

121
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:17,440
any in user station today between 48
machines

122
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,870
whenever this came out I got a good
chuckle out of it there's actually a

123
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,170
small thing with wildfire that a lot of
people often overlooked and that's the

124
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,850
screen are here I don't know if you can
see very well there but the default

125
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,410
settings actually determine the file
size limits that can be tested by

126
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,180
wildfire so if you are down at the MS
Office document the defaults as 500

127
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,660
kilobytes so if office document goes
through it that's larger than 500

128
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,980
kilobytes wildfire while actually nor
did not even tested in the first place

129
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,130
so you could go through and looking for
one CPU or you just embedded images and

130
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,070
you can see it's the same behavior with
PTSD which are actually even smaller

131
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:03,630
size of its obviously all this can be
adjusted within the toll but as you may

132
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:11,440
know a lot of organizations often
overlooked a double so another

133
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,280
observation is a high-level its 2015
most of our security tool still a great

134
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,070
WTF as if I have a sandbox and solution
and it finds a malicious file which is

135
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,780
email to my organization why does my
aviation

136
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,090
why doesn't my URL filtering
automatically become aware of the CTU

137
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:39,230
URLs and IP's where's my eighty is aware
of it with all my perimeter boxes

138
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,500
including my spam filter to
automatically bought the stuff before it

139
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,700
even hits the endpoint first place so if
one security control becomes aware of a

140
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,370
threat

141
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,640
all other securities trial

142
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,280
control should become aware so I think
we need to create an ecosystem of

143
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:02,730
security mechanisms not just 10 Silas so
to do this I know that intelligence is

144
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,690
kind of had done a lot of this at heart
but I feel like it only went to the 50

145
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,450
yard line whereas we need to take it all
the way to the touchdown so in this

146
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,920
example we have a signature behavior
server at the sinner which basically

147
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,460
becomes aware of all the these threats
and integrates with different vendor

148
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,560
solutions and in this example if I P S
becomes a threat and generates signature

149
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,400
it shared with the centralized and has
passed the other controls and the

150
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,290
environment

151
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,400
90 vendors probably have a little bit of
a conflict of interest because if you

152
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,640
look at AV IPS vendors intelligence
behind their signatures is kind of their

153
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,790
bread and butter so they don't really
want to share that is gonna say they

154
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,990
have the best tool out there to block
this kind of a little detail overcome

155
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,900
but for security professionals to be
successful at the role I think this is a

156
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:06,200
real attraction so sure most of you know
but today's most common attack vector is

157
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,340
actually a lot of places that have
written about this is actually email

158
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,560
attachments most common one still today
or office documents with macros built in

159
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,230
another way to behave kind of varies
from time to time sometimes i download

160
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:27,020
them our directly or sometimes I make a
call the PowerShell TXC sometimes that's

161
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,450
running JavaScript in the background or
even recently I've run across in PDS

162
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,090
actually invented a word document within
the PDS and then the user had opened

163
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:41,250
that word document and then run the
macro so it's kind of crazy so when we

164
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,380
go through some of these quick wins a
lot of a kind of designed specifically

165
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,370
to Thor against this type of threat

166
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:53,220
and the reason is twofold wine its way a
lot of the mouth where we're seeing

167
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,190
today like dire as well as a lot of
Pinterest engagements is actually their

168
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:05,050
foothold in the door if you look at
Daves program he put out that unicorn

169
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:11,850
hi it actually generates a macro based
PowerShell back door so some of the

170
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:20,910
things we'll talk about that so now
offer some quick wins so what we're

171
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,860
number one

172
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,870
deploying advanced and point security
solution

173
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:31,190
examples are prominent wraps but neither
he met the main focus here to be on even

174
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:37,460
though as it's the quickest when due to
it being free and easy to control one

175
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,440
downside major downside is it does like
visibility so it's almost like a set it

176
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,950
and forget it I want you to play across
your network you can control the

177
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,190
medications using Group Policy actually
prevents about four hours alone and

178
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,630
point you have no way of knowing about
it unless you're seeking your windows

179
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:58,040
for military and user stuff back to a
centralized server but that level

180
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:05,570
logging is often not easy to attain
storage requirements in addition once

181
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,110
you deploy imma make sure that you
ensure to configure to monitor process

182
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,810
is not configured and it's a profile a
lot of people actually deploy email just

183
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,420
kind of leave it there hoping it's doing
good form without realizing some of the

184
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,070
specifics that it does but it actually
DLL and every process is configured in

185
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,000
its profile that's how monitors the
memory-based and without doing without

186
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,240
configuring the process he may not be
getting all the protections this is

187
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,700
especially true for any custom based
apps are rare third party apps they may

188
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,950
find organs

189
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:48,960
so what benefits do he met his more
operational so anytime a new zero-day

190
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,060
vulnerability comes out what is it that
all the security teams do we all run

191
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,560
around like a chicken with her head
chopped off screaming script and pass

192
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,050
all the things now whenever we continue
to see do that it creates a burden on

193
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,780
the ITV operational team that's
responsible for these matching these

194
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,720
patches and if he continues they do that
over and over again at some point like

195
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,530
crying wolf and if you're doing it

196
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:20,080
middle it quickly become too much so if
you have something like he met her traps

197
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,820
in place which doing in TX / anti 0 day
you have a compensating controls in

198
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,150
place to kind of counter a lot of these
vulnerabilities that are coming to my

199
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,520
cell from a risk perspective if you have
a compensating controls in place do you

200
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,480
really need to patch right away or can
you just wait till your next cycle

201
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,060
you know into this month next month
whatever it is and that obviously that's

202
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,680
not an answer I can give you is up to
each organization's risk level but if

203
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,180
you have a compensating control helps
lower the risk

204
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:57,570
quick win number two in this is probably
one of the bigger ones control execution

205
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,750
of files within the temp directory so
there are third-party programs that make

206
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:10,410
this easy like traps or even Kaspersky
so we can do it in addition you can also

207
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:16,240
use Group Policy a blocker software
restriction policies a blocker I believe

208
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,160
it from a license in perspective but
software restriction policies can be

209
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:31,260
used in any version to my knowledge
maybe it'll be easier to configure some

210
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,510
example file types to block the
execution of include yell out

211
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:42,020
executables VPS temp files PowerShell
scripts I would say 90% of them our

212
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,400
encounter in the past two years would be
a hundred percent block utilizing this

213
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,419
ninety percent

214
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,399
if you're not familiar with our in depth
with a lot of recent power basically

215
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:56,700
they copy almost always download stage
to power into the temp directory that's

216
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,489
what they executed out of that too btw
reasons why no matter the user account

217
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:05,440
that it's running up it's going to
always have write access to the temp

218
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,169
directory number to it how many users to
you know go looking directories and

219
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:19,909
files and they're not gonna be able to
tell and other small thing I discovered

220
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:27,559
was a display its script basically
automatically start back door and let

221
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,649
you customize it seems to block it
oftentimes because it basically creates

222
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:38,350
a script and the temp directory other
small benefit there is going to be a

223
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:43,700
little bit for example some programs may
actually legitimately execute how to

224
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:51,389
tempt you have to create a wireless for
those samples I found myself burners are

225
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:56,179
creators for some reason when you're
running those run something that

226
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:03,200
attempts and Edition Java updates now
depending on your organization this may

227
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,669
or may not affect you if you're not
doing patch management on job to begin

228
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:12,129
with but if you're not doing patch
management and you're relying on the

229
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:15,440
agents actually automatically update
itself that's where it'll execute

230
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,640
attempt and it all this will actually
stop start blocking

231
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,680
so quickly number three you your URL
filtering categorization obviously

232
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,730
whatever your solution there's obvious
ones double lock which include malware

233
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:41,610
phishing proxies dynamic in assets also
try to block unknown and UnCategorised

234
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:46,310
this will have an operational impact and
you need to account for this before

235
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,300
doing it

236
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,379
however may prevent a lot of power back
to running home properly as if you look

237
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,800
at the life cycle of any URL or domain
that comes up before the URL filtering

238
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,070
vendor becomes aware of it it's
basically I know so if you're blocking

239
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,970
that category you're blocking it from
the set to URLs used the first place

240
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,590
however in addition to this there's also
a lot of legitimate stuff that that is

241
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,990
out on the internet that the URL
filtering vendors haven't become aware

242
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,730
out so you just need to be ready with a
place for women in user report something

243
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:30,450
that's a lot we need to have a process
in place to visit the businesses and

244
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:37,120
organizations kind of miss this as well
as any time you run across your

245
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:56,620
categorize we all are rising and our own
tool

246
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:06,610
video some reason we don't get the
speaker we have immediate replacement

247
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,400
sorry for the inconvenience
