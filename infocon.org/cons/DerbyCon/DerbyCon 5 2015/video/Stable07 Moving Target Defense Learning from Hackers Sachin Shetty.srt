1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,770
psycho T Tennessee State University so
the talk is moving target different some

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,710
lessons from happen so the basis of the
podcast what can we learn from the

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:18,930
botnet evolution says the late nineties
still going right and so how can I love

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,680
defense mechanisms can learn from the
trials and tribulations so the botnets

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:33,230
and taking a page from the hype is
taking place on booknotes so again most

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,410
of the stuff as I can to make somebody
that has made its way to these offers

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,360
operational but Mitt major defense
techniques I'm gonna talk about his

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,680
academic but the book that stuff is so
that's known for everybody and so the

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,480
lesson from this talk is what can we
learn from that and how we can be ago

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,690
defense systems more robust so that the
focus and no talk about some ongoing

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:02,960
work that my lab is so working on so so
what is a problem so most of us know

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,380
cyberwarfare symmetric you try to plug
one another one opens up and so does a

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,840
losing battle so if you look at the
defense techniques ride so that so many

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,909
times online some top most of them but
bob says that Africa which as we all

15
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:27,070
know it's not very effective so while
they're not as active again there is a

16
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,310
magical night can we then take a leaf
out of diapers played with other

17
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:39,909
partners split with brad is a fortifying
every asset make the systems move to the

18
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,979
defendant had one right so easy said
than done right what do you mean systems

19
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,380
move you talk to your doctor composites
OSU got off to a book operating system

20
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,829
that works so that odd lot of things you
could do was to find that resents

21
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,290
complexity challenge and how do you
balance the tradeoff between perceived

22
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:07,369
security advantage and performers that
your favorite so that's what we'll talk

23
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,280
about so again and not shows what is MGD

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,340
it is coming W mechanisms that a divorce
can be done via the social network

25
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,450
continue this shift being enjoy and be
dynamic so in essence if you present a

26
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,540
static configuration then you're right
so it's very easy to use and what can

27
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:36,530
you do so that you can not stopping is
almost like any you know professional

28
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,350
sports and you gonna make you can't
defeat good player he could just make

29
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,580
them work hard right that's the
associate can be makes the grocery work

30
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:54,700
harder and with that why some time while
you're predicting your system so again

31
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,160
not a new concept the military has used
it this has been going on said I don't

32
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,180
worry if you've read about couples are
using a lot so this is an example of a

33
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,090
dogfight

34
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,340
you're trying to figure out what type of
tactics you can apply to read that I was

35
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:21,090
so this is a bad idea did you watch this
episode of Star Trek this is the shoes

36
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:29,070
again trying to figure out whether you
can run down my street calm skies are

37
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,489
discussed uses a lot random I suspect on
the work going on according to radio

38
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:40,230
network is deeply running my cell
frequencies and individuals again in

39
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,130
this but if you remember this didn't
work out very well because it was you

40
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,690
can go at 10 so that when the game is
set up that way you know you're gonna

41
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,450
look so hopefully that's not a case of
the time

42
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:02,670
so coming to terms software systems the
workers going on at all just let us how

43
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,400
can you run your program for instance if
you have your javascript so if you know

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,140
in JavaScript if you want to do any type
of cross it was drunk driving accident I

45
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,239
did not get that done by element get up
with that idea right so everybody knows

46
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,410
that what is your new what it is not
exactly the same as judges but as some

47
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:31,060
random ass worship right so then you're
making it difficult for the hiker to

48
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,100
quickly realized across attack same
thing at the whole network mobile so you

49
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:43,510
can identify how did you modify that
different systems and networks so again

50
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,620
as I mentioned some of this operation of
some of the work at the construction

51
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,889
site is operational already in tel aviv
you have done that a lot of other words

52
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,410
you didn't recent face the reason why is
he so just because the chinese just

53
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,910
gotta just mentioned went to move my
abdomen how to find out what does it

54
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,160
cost I think the cost is not clear right
so you can tell me the nice technique

55
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,900
but users and customers want to know
that what is a cost of you moving mass

56
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,860
that just because you feel that that's
early detection of attack what is a

57
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:23,889
performance tradeoff is it what is your
life use it at doing so so much going on

58
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,470
as if you stop at the o'grady

59
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,250
low-level insurgency minimization so if
you have ever written about 40 flow so

60
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,370
you know of it before although the basic
concept is injective Co tried many

61
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,940
different reasons but ultimately the
concept as I got to make my code run on

62
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:48,660
your system so I get to do that I get
rule that says that you and how you get

63
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,490
into it is not a point rise point is
that you can you can execute

64
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,580
just randomized instructions said well
you code doesn't work

65
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,659
but if prices are you assuming that
instruction said it's not what if that

66
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:09,270
is not knowing what instruction set has
been so this is the origins are from

67
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,900
biology on genital mutilation what can
we do that best option set so making

68
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,039
sure the programming language is unknown
at that goods and of course there's a

69
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:25,180
tradeoff all your boundaries because
they have to be you know making sure

70
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,539
that they don't follow the standard you
just said but a modified so it's a trade

71
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:34,190
off to make sure just to preventive
title you go to all those that sentiment

72
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,150
binaries tossed around a must during
installation so that's a tradeoff you

73
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:45,020
got to take into account the city the
same type of deal but you're trying to

74
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,659
have any money laundering randomized
it's a system call

75
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:54,090
entry point of insertion of knobs to
make the programs functionally

76
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,129
equivalent but different rates

77
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:03,400
ok so this is a good example of the App
Store to download an app from the App

78
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,120
Store and it wasn't invited he will be
different this and bridges to say right

79
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,440
so with all the different for once you
will notice that function the same but

80
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,800
you don't bother to make sure that
they're not the same bunnies if you have

81
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,520
a warm days trying to propagate this
moment probably because I decided that

82
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,430
the miners and has just taken to the
next level

83
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:33,349
why did you want to find the others and
making it difficult for any words to a

84
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:38,060
public Internet service do with these
examples that was talking about that

85
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,419
JavaScript right so you can make sure
that your secret injection process to be

86
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:48,940
don't work because your random ice your
secret queries your javascript and why

87
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,430
don't you post group still right what do
you pull scripts and all those keywords

88
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,400
and all the functions those being the
same you can either use encryption can

89
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,680
use index soaring mechanism to just do
or see five that you must diversify the

90
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,630
function colonies and I don't have a
signed book called you but you can't

91
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:15,889
imagine that you didn't can be
translated to a slightly different

92
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:24,449
version by reading you envision kisi and
you'll get a different type of diversity

93
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:27,940
right so to make sure that those who are
trying to do

94
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,370
network was penetration and remediation
activities how to make sure there are 12

95
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,490
again your IP addresses and you're not
in Tables tried to make it harder to do

96
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,329
so your network record recon and you
think our network fingerprinting will

97
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:51,029
not be successful so that was pretty
much the state of the art that is going

98
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:57,290
on what I want to spend more time as the
book but so most of you know what about

99
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,290
dentist network computers that set up
two hundred different activities they

100
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,750
have a command-and-control center that
are responsible and so there is a need

101
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,190
to know that allowed into the qualities
I need to be able to evade detective

102
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,490
leading to be able to monitor the
activities do some disruption figured

103
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,250
out future command and control
technologies and just recover from the

104
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,790
damage this is evolution but I have
slice

105
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:32,660
so real quick do this or a couple of
minutes

106
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,990
it all started botanist most of us I see
it started with using audio channels and

107
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,959
trust the channels you would be able to
communicate with you

108
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:51,449
CNC but easy to take down tried this
hard coded situations so did take time

109
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:57,040
for your stops this thing on 2002 it was

110
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:05,149
time to go and so since 2002 we have
done it just like mister gated still

111
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:06,220
centralized

112
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,399
still haven't gone into distributed
there still centralized

113
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,920
we are now beginning to worry about can
we had different ideas so there was big

114
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,949
enough as is done but there's no doubt
that using flash floods

115
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:28,490
drugs so but most of the technique well
you can have DNS records of your domain

116
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,380
name but the time to live value is very
shocked maybe you'll notice a few

117
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,860
seconds to get trying to go through a
lot same domain name but different IP

118
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,459
address in a short period of time you
just going to addresses and it is not

119
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:43,410
typical

120
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:50,339
so that your boss + but that's easy to
catch to your IP addresses but you gotta

121
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:58,300
see an easy to use so that they can do
to make this right so they give up but

122
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,950
out make sure the domain inside another
same so the chain the domain names by

123
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:08,190
thing every week they had a different
domain name attached to partner with so

124
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,780
many and just any deterministic schemes
because that's the premise but so what

125
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,410
it would take me to you however if
deterministic it's easy to get hold of

126
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:29,400
you get the domain name floods against
the numbers to 50,000 amazed everyday so

127
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:36,230
again so he stated but central nice even
though they had some sort of does

128
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:44,450
dynamism instead the challenges that the
opposition was right you're trying to

129
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,100
office schedule says that's not working

130
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,560
goodnight office did you change your
domain name that's not working because

131
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,980
you determine demand generation is
deterministic so it's easy to catch you

132
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,070
what it would take to you come up with I
would change the domain name but I do

133
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,790
recall today all vehicles whatever you
want to come open day at all easy to

134
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,830
catch the bus still deterministic so the
maturation started happening on about

135
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:18,780
2,000 it finally 1970 92008 two years to
go to decentralize

136
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,970
so now you're talking about I don't know
many of you know hostile work so skype

137
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,220
works with this side of the water and I
guess from home but traditionally died

138
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,360
yesterday so you're using a centralized
and a p2p architecture ok so you have

139
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,270
just five months which are behind the
net and you have your pictures which are

140
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,730
busy give up monsters which are
connecting this time and that's what a

141
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,300
Skype what's unique about you relay
notes and then you have your end users

142
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,590
who want to talk to each other and so
this was the beginning of a more

143
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,010
sophisticated botnet which is harder to
crack because now they also using

144
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:03,390
encrypted communications not revealing
themselves too much not exploit seeing

145
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,910
each other to everything else so you
have to do very intelligent network

146
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,760
traffic analysis you can still get us to
make their potentials and that's what

147
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,410
was done similar to Skype

148
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,819
to no Skype words you got to do traffic
analysis to figure out how the

149
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:22,790
occupation set up so no more was has
been done but not much is known still a

150
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:30,089
lot of the communication between the
toes go through encrypted chance said as

151
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:36,300
hybrid and complete b2b botnet which is
also similar but it's so hard to

152
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,189
infiltrate the C&C

153
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:45,189
does his words but not good enough so
that's an example of a one-time Wireless

154
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:50,870
which was propagated by one of this
modest so that is the sum of the last

155
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,779
two buttons that are sure you are by far
the most robust architectures and so

156
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:02,220
that's where we need to defense
mechanisms based on it that's the way to

157
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,329
go to find out just popped into politics
of this is summarize everything so you

158
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:08,720
got your hierarchy

159
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,519
replicating that were then the different
authentication mechanisms possible

160
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,040
aggression control mechanism you think
you gonna do a single injection of CNC

161
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,209
so does so and then you are riding
mechanism you are adding mechanism is

162
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:30,790
including ask me boss as possible so are
you gonna go through IP base DNS based

163
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,199
then as farce trucks so on and so forth
so what is your random entities to

164
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:43,199
include as many as possible so that's
the entire evolution so so what did we

165
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,279
learn that in 1997 to 2015 onwards the
progression from studying going to

166
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:57,110
happen dismissed idolize these channels
port numbers addresses and the end us so

167
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:05,390
that's where the CNC mechanisms evolved
from static to dynamic

168
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:11,640
type and poison prevention so make sure
that the bid to be less doesn't get

169
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:19,150
poison and indexes not poisoned that's
also something I wanted to use cloud

170
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,780
computing as a system so most of the
botnet

171
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,420
ideas can be applied so cloud computing
system that was structured it's

172
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,100
distributed on demand access to
computing storage and network resources

173
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:42,310
so and TV you want to do sistema network
was legislation to achieve diversity and

174
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,700
because you have a lot of it done that

175
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:52,630
computing storage and network resources
you can pull this off so again one of

176
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:58,000
their taxes included depriving access so
you can and does happen with the Xbox

177
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,040
Netflix you cannot watch get all the
services because there was a deal with

178
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,410
it had similarly

179
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:14,180
cloud based on lack of a couple of
examples of it as you go to sports to go

180
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:20,230
to Netflix's which is dependent on
Amazon robust done that also depends on

181
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:29,010
Amazon for its infrastructure related
and Bachmann they both have the same

182
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:35,570
infrastructure the distributed they are
supposed to be protesting alleged vote

183
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,580
then you know how does seem to get
bosnia-wide you contact on then how can

184
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,980
a box that survived some of them but not
every one of them and that's what

185
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,610
clothes so resistant loan from the right
so you can take some of the cloud

186
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:58,760
resources but not so so you lose access
to the Service entire

187
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:05,199
so funny

188
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,579
capabilities you have many randomization
your code obfuscation encryption and

189
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:16,320
utility right how can you randomized
your source of you and those are the

190
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:26,990
things that the cloud infrastructure
needs two bases design on so more

191
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,080
details so the network topology 11
preserve it comes on the dynamic CNC

192
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,800
architectures so understanding the Bucs
come on and control structure which

193
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,440
right now is a combination of Highbridge
centralized I just need to be an

194
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,210
understanding that architecture and
involving some of those principles

195
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:55,550
systems might lead to very resilient
structure the scheduling based on

196
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:00,720
diversity and again showed examples out
there was always the worst recession and

197
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,570
the whole goal is to have a continual

198
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,810
shifting at that surface so that is the
holy grail right is so hard to pull this

199
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,440
off to have a continuously CDC
understated up to you but to pull it off

200
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,810
too high of the shifting at a service at
you apt just system network and all seem

201
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:26,260
to be working together will take a lot
of time but it's taught to see whether

202
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:32,470
that can make it difficult for the
Tigers to get into it so I just keep

203
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,590
this one is charged so some of the work
that I'm doing so this is one of the

204
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:43,300
world that we just completed the work
was to migrate your ads across what's

205
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,860
your mission and to do that

206
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,630
across heterogeneous was so to make sure
the same one that nobody does not get to

207
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,690
propagate it says they will have little
if you have a heterogeneous whatcha

208
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,700
machine replication not homogeneous
heterogeneous what's emerging

209
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,880
application so you avoid across
different horizons

210
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,970
all of your morning across different
guest losses for the same hydrolyzed

211
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:12,590
whatever the case may be so that was a
technique and not been still a

212
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,250
cloud-based and today you had a
randomized replica of a system's ride

213
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,450
and a randomized replica based on
different high prices for difference in

214
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,740
all this but different sizes different
guest voice of a simple was so that you

215
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,560
see your head region so let's say what
everybody will not again we did this

216
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:43,080
stinks but some of things we didn't do a
live user activity going on in what is a

217
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,910
promise that we haven't done that and so
the performance can be an issue

218
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:53,050
depending on the user's activities lot
it's not like that some of the future

219
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:59,270
was that we need to do but it was good
stuff for us to look into it just more

220
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:04,950
details on how we did this and if you
look me up to see some of the work we

221
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:11,730
did here and we were trying to also do
the same clinical do our city to present

222
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:17,990
your network admission into a different
they vote just so you know all the

223
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,110
different in that box and you can do as
you thought your network system say

224
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:29,040
again so rumors 0101 should mention 1984
to a city and then we also wanted to see

225
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,170
the cost of that cost us more dogged
defense so this was a bid to figure out

226
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,930
what would be the class you're moving
your whatchu machines just because

227
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,480
you're anticipating an attack would look
good the cost to the other activities on

228
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,360
the net right so you have other duties
and they have their own clothes you so

229
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,230
so how do you balance it to just because
you're trying to wage an attack by

230
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,120
moving your ass between different
whatcha machines how would that affect

231
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,880
the quality of service so what is the
cost of MDD so we had a cost model to

232
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,950
look at

233
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:09,299
the cost of moving your application so
that would be a good incentive rights

234
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:15,769
and incentive mechanism that uses right
so if that some costs incurred in moving

235
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:23,600
the use this weekend's then the use it
could be insane do I just about to read

236
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:31,240
so this is my summer so again MDS a
strategy to learn from botnets some of

237
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,519
the techniques I showed examples

238
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:39,519
instruction that would do was study
software or city combined lol do most of

239
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:48,139
the city and to be able to pull that off
with a good at this and with mobility

240
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:53,169
social networking and we haven't even
looked into those areas how mobility and

241
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:59,740
social networking and the random there's
an empty list into this tax on them to

242
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:07,220
these games and hopefully this policies
are in place then we can make some

243
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,519
headway into security metrics
