1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
so sorry not sorry so I'm home argh I'm
redacted redacted I certifications they

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,090
are redacted and redacted redacted my
bishop the new reform churches wifi

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,010
remember team has cat and I'm in
building two clusters for a while maybe

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:24,220
kind of a disclaimer this talk is not a
few sanctioned by anybody my opinions

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,199
are mine and mine alone all content this
talk is my opinion based on experience

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,410
please don't sue me AMD's your stuff
sucks they're likely to access the

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:39,770
content that controversial I'm not sorry
all references to we are related to a

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,969
hypothetical spherical monkey in a
vacuum in no way referring to any entity

9
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:49,960
real or imagined at all and it was shape
and reform our point skills are terrible

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,449
I don't care

11
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,930
socket there's also the anti-war we
talked for those who don't know if she

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,270
were hit talking under become one about
how is cheaper and more effective to

13
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,570
crack stuff in the clawed now my
clusters can beat Amazon ec2 any day of

14
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:12,170
the week don't try to sucks sorry Steve
so why are we here I'm certain I

15
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,979
received a lot of work it's just outside
on the side of my desk and every once in

16
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,640
a while we'll have somebody come on in
and the outcome of the likely cost the

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,970
cluster is there likely took a dive and
officials will try password cracking and

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,689
babies he set the house on fire

19
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,150
angry email the other week going hey
your instructions for some thing I set

20
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,939
up I followed to the letter and ya
hooked up 14 rigs on a 15 amp power

21
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:44,619
supply 110 volt in my house burned down
sorry so I'm getting tired of this crap

22
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:47,560
so that's what we're talking about is
how not to say your house on fire and

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,420
how do this right now go big go home but
basically dropped the monkey from the

24
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,299
gym floor we did the mass met two days
or noted gear from Apogee rockets you do

25
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,710
stuff properly this world are you
talking to do it through properly and

26
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,130
maybe 10 some fire if you do my
insurance doesn't cover yours to pay

27
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:13,340
these good luck so power power power
power power is the killer in this world

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:21,129
we used 240 volt 20 at 2:30 a.m. feeds
almost exclusively why is on 110 you're

29
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,470
typically get a Mac so your feet on a
single system relatively quickly

30
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,910
report on average about seven half am
saw 240 volt which will probably melt

31
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,720
things the wrong cables which their gear
as a result some pain also use a metered

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,459
PDU use its really nice know how much
amperage these things can draw as you

33
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:44,709
will set stuff on fire

34
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,680
I've done it it happens I'll make sure
you have a really good fire department

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,530
on standby miss you guys love you don't
do this new rise don't do this in your

36
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:59,900
basement when you're running sixty these
things it kinda gets a little hot ya

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,360
doin the datacenter work for small for
GPU systems reusing 1500 watt supply

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,050
time supplies don't cheap out and buy
700 watt bronze raided I bought from

39
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,450
Fry's Electronics for five bucks from
some guy named I'll just things melt and

40
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,349
money melton not spectacularly I've seen
square stoles my year I mean I bernard

41
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:24,300
systems on average like hella parse
player to a year even with this stuff so

42
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,670
I can't imagine the garbage they use
these like when clusters stuff will

43
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,769
catch on fire to larger time boxes reuse
and triple redundant power supplies

44
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,720
you know you looked up to big sixty and
fees and everything else just kids stuff

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,489
works also people are using this cheap
crappy PCI Express cable by flexing

46
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,980
overnight from China those things will
catch fire in five seconds just don't do

47
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,470
it again

48
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,030
fire fire fire that happens

49
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,340
cluster sucks a lot of power but a lot
of power I think my power bills for

50
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,790
running a single dual mode

51
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,540
my house was 30 bucks a month and I got
an email about that the other day goin

52
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,200
hey you know this cluster is sucking me
back 12 grand a month or two hundred

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,730
bucks a month on power what the hell how
to reduce the power consumption easy

54
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,269
answer either get our cards or just
don't do it

55
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,530
running a large cluster is not for the
faint of heart

56
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,840
the average hobbyist datacenter work the
average hobbyist can survive with for

57
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,120
GPUs maybe to just don't run up for
twenty-four seven cases these things are

58
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,870
kinda power-hungry especially indie
stuff videos running 185 unsecured they

59
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,849
don't suck as much but they still suck
my favorite part

60
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:47,169
dunno I use PCI Express extenders they
reiterate that don't use them people

61
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,090
using the lake when red cuz they will
buy the cheapest mother brother can find

62
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,389
a spot a hundred bucks on average I
might have a couple of x1 connectors so

63
00:04:54,389 --> 00:05:02,699
like six cards to do some hash Cattleya
burning motherboard video card

64
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:09,650
killing a sick ugh you know you'll have
a $5 paperweight or more of them and

65
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,380
yeah I just don't do that again make
sure you use proper motherboards don't

66
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,130
buy $100 motherboards use that the
Republican gamers for reg serrated

67
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,180
components and we still burning
motherboards every other month like this

68
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,380
Stephanie running 24 7 365 with no
brakes can kill systems make sure you

69
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,409
get a budget for it for about twenty
grand a year ish on average in card

70
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:39,010
replacements it happens

71
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,199
burns are boards really really bad
actually render members upwards really

72
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,360
really badly ya also use some slides on
this in a bit

73
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:58,409
we made a responsible for killing DEFCON
I'm sorry but not sorry yeah so use the

74
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:02,509
other part its people the Audrain by
Anand reference cars all the time

75
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:06,729
cheaper I look fine here now because you
don't know what a reference card verses

76
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:11,599
on non-russians kurt is reference card
like many video AMD is the exact spec 20

77
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,520
see on the picture

78
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,729
they'll look the same some have said it
better components but the big difference

79
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:22,020
is their fans blow the air front and
back as opposed to down now say you have

80
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,830
eighty these things cram the chassis
with a non reference card the fans on

81
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,729
grind the card below and blow a hundred
and ten degrees Celsius air down to the

82
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:35,159
car below causing it to melt lately
causing a fire both rouge et power and

83
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:42,090
the and from the general melt so it gets
kinda messy and for those of you

84
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,750
wondering why I am bashing him do you
have a single power it's how they keep

85
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,819
them all design envelope they call it
through to wasps closer to 430 Sabrina

86
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:55,240
motherboard and seconds so the 290 exit
sign up

87
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,520
have a bad habit of destroying bored so
we switched all to the Nvidia cards

88
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,009
'cause they're hundred 5175 what's a
card for the same performance you when

89
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:08,419
you get to this kind of scale it's all
about price per water as opposed to

90
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:13,509
price performance so that's why
recession though is if you want to go to

91
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:18,020
switch to your order of preference the
Titan X cards oh my god I want tons of

92
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,699
those their grade but GTX 985 reeboks
Canadian they worked their bulletproof

93
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,330
I've not seen one failed the field yet
so we have been away for a week and

94
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,650
haven't been running the new fury such
as well just sorry I like seeing him do

95
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,800
you come back but I think the dying and
their driver suck they've got like one

96
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:47,690
driver developer working in China like
two days a week cooling cooling cooling

97
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,930
so one little trick I found out is you
need a biblical amount of air that's the

98
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,590
only way of describing it like if you
think you've got enough airflow triple

99
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,880
it add some more as some more and then
you might may be out of work you

100
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,909
something supplementary calling on top
of this season best upgrade boards their

101
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:09,740
fans just can't get the proper airflow
if you own a cheap Bialek high-grade CIN

102
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,180
from c2 systems those guys their stuff
actually works but otherwise fans fans

103
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,639
more fans

104
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,050
probably the water is that has a habit
of leaking randomly and when you're

105
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,789
running this year I'm lazy at all to go
so check my water pumps all the time I

106
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:32,490
look at my gear when it breaks and I'm
lazy so you don't have water if you want

107
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,149
to run water and your rig and blow up
$1,000 board and then the video cards be

108
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,360
my guest don't come crying to be on
hashtags I'm not going to help you at

109
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,709
all ever

110
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:54,310
rack servers are bad time boards at the
big way GPU render streams attacked a

111
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,339
dar and everything else

112
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:01,050
those things work like hot damn they put
basically two banks of fans top and

113
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:07,140
bottom and then there are two or three
deep in apush 300 CFM for CFM across the

114
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,959
cards and it's somebody jet engine taken
off but they work which also leads the

115
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:16,579
other question we get my card is so loud
on hash cracking run why does it sound

116
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:20,430
like a jet engine that's air flow that
is the sound of life don't stick this

117
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,060
new home entertainment center and wonder
why it's a lot I'm not responsible for

118
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:32,110
relationships ended because your Jeep
you up at night just saying it's

119
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,320
happened I got that email was funny as
hell so back to the lazy topic I am

120
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,010
extremely extremely lazy when you're
running your 14 15 16 nodes every time

121
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,399
we swap cards out it's recommended to
rebuild their systems that control nodes

122
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:53,089
are a cluster node so i've a little USB
boot stick based off of you know some

123
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:57,930
priests involved in everything else and
do not install colored a same settings

124
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:04,940
automate that component well running
Ubuntu 1404 LTS it works it doesn't die

125
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,579
thing with running a cluster sizes we
don't stick with leading-edge we stick

126
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:10,890
with what works

127
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,470
2470 on a budget for hours and you're
running oh my God my drivers have some

128
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,529
weird incompatibility in crash sector
notes stick to its stable

129
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:25,009
you know get something like Linux CEO he
won two matches for men

130
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:29,959
this fifty ways to skin this cat real
security we have some of the other also

131
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,620
get puppet and double salt run Dec some
kind of systems automation utility cuz

132
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,610
if you are actually as a staging your
boxes to manage these things you doing

133
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,639
it wrong I never shall autonomy clusters
unless they break and we've got them

134
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,910
running forever to face my phone almost
improperly secured hit a button

135
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,589
rebuilding no doubt a patch with apt-get
update for 14 hours kiss you . to

136
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:57,579
automation that's just it takes time and
we're doing this professionally you

137
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,970
don't have worn a couple hours to run
these clusters right I have a real job

138
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:07,290
as well rabin's doing this stuff so
autumn for managing you it's the full

139
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:17,889
time job at Nova itself yes I apparently
have a real job you are random and no

140
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:28,870
one manages you you're you're done it
this is true exactly so you see there's

141
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,660
no manager here is just unindicted
coconspirators

142
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:39,550
so clustering that's about four years
ago three years ago I don't hear in

143
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,319
person called VCL or super see all the
cool kids are doing this article that

144
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:48,269
journey Ghazni put out about 225 GPU
cluster cracking everything we all got

145
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:54,420
the emails every freaking out about him
well never actually worst kind of worked

146
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,370
but he's gonna InfiniBand to go handle
all its back and clustering it was

147
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,800
finicky prone areas a crashed it
wouldn't load them anyhow yet maybe a

148
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,709
hundred thousand it before I broke it
just didn't quite work but it was enough

149
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:12,000
is a showpiece that kind of tolerated
things so Adam got pissed off at this

150
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,699
could get her to patch in the thing and
he made something called dash skip dash

151
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,730
limited dusty space so we do now is you
can go make your own cluster software

152
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,589
basically just skip their slimming
dashiki spaces is defeated an attack

153
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,220
give it dashed ASCII space it spits out

154
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,480
how long it's gonna be able to crack and
you can see I'm going to limit this to

155
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,980
the first 50,000 hits on this in Delhi
skip ahead in the kitchen components is

156
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,339
like a giant enhance our store files
directly from the command line so very

157
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,509
good job to a couple hundred nodes
stream's manifest SCP things over and

158
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,569
stuff just works every clustering
software on the market using hash get

159
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,350
relies on this very technique that's
hashtag reason has to put these in this

160
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,310
stage see the same thing see below
ballot that gives you just have to send

161
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,230
a job down and then you know do you
swear must close to a while but

162
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:10,199
otherwise it's easy and pancakes so your
cluster controllers

163
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,029
this is the thing people under spec
badly because two controllers basically

164
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:18,370
police defuse and has to push the giant
MySQL database server a really crappy

165
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,949
Apache friend with no she left her cell
so it's a piece of junk but it does a

166
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,069
lot of database work so this is just a
standard spec for a database server use

167
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:32,620
a lot of RAM use Autodesk through a big
ass Nick on it and you should be roughly

168
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,189
ok miles might vary depending on your
datacenter as but it'll work some people

169
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:41,389
do the stuff over the internet if you
put a harsh to push cluster on the

170
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:48,689
internet he deserved to get pwned sorry
so middleware middleware is the software

171
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:52,509
used to destroy your jobs to the
client's it's basically given agent on

172
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:55,189
your client you've got your server
backend

173
00:13:55,189 --> 00:14:00,009
just spit so jobs all day long if you're
lazy really really lazy and you have a

174
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:05,329
lot of money you can buy half stack we
have some of their hardware hardware

175
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:10,920
scraped not a fan of their software it's
good it's tricky but you can't use

176
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,629
things like this beta builds you have to
use the opposing because I'm on the beta

177
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:20,240
team we get new house with all the time
like the new Ashley Madison leaks and

178
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,220
few others were testing those out so
which had exactly use those on for years

179
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,279
we have to use the crappy open source
stuff but if you want to make stuff that

180
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,270
just works

181
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,990
but you really don't need middle where
you don't you don't bash scripts i've

182
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,180
did in spreadsheets better defer
contests is yet

183
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,040
Google Docs a hearing run these dead
shall special his your attacks from

184
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,920
adults and kids and Tuktoyaktuk that's
gonna burn his house down and you know

185
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,010
or don't you botnet that works too I've
seen housecat loaded into a botnet that

186
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:59,940
accepts the you like someone's nodes and
make sure the stands watching my talks

187
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:08,130
say as a rant about how stuck again it
is fully commercially supported his gear

188
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,750
if you burn on the motherboard

189
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,020
overnight you one if you burn video card
bill overnight you 1 keep a lot more

190
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:20,790
free stuff by it all off Xmas capex for
us capex is for repairs for Don house

191
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,340
techno adds this whole thing is purely
operating dollars so kind of works by

192
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,220
your mileage may vary by Jackies you
figure it out

193
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,280
no one that does as cluster besides
relay talks will what they used they'll

194
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,450
have their secret sauce but it's usually
pay some of these variants so as to

195
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:46,460
place both two years ago a guy named
curly boy created some abomination of a

196
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,720
of a cluster software its base case he
sharp dot net app on the back and

197
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,850
running in mono on Linux with PHP on a
Linux box is no security on the website

198
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:05,270
whatsoever no ACL's no cell no TLS needs
and taking to make it work and but once

199
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,510
he said we firewalls and your W and
secure those things VPNs and everything

200
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,890
else it kinda works ok and it's what we
mainly use best part is I can throw

201
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:20,550
hundred-thousand raw files added they
just go straight through

202
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:30,140
works but your mileage may vary again
led a key asset tracking software my

203
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,630
favorite method those manual
distribution method using bash scripts

204
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,510
things are a few cheap this works as
well

205
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,850
again we seized a ship dash limit

206
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,440
set up a list of Comput

207
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,380
this line right here the OCL has kids 64
dub in that's exactly how the software

208
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:57,019
does it it's just no setup a limit fired
off spectators budgets now for the fun

209
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:06,559
stuff the stuff that's not near cluster
software used of one sort or another

210
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:14,250
video camera so if you have a large
cluster and it's always happens a lot of

211
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,770
a couple of options you can sit idle and
do nothing you generate all coins like

212
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,799
del rena mandate and crashed left the
DEFCON economy which is funny as heck

213
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:27,720
are you turn random attacks random I
mean really random go on trial some

214
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,470
big-ticket NFS mount clusters on their
new set of a script the loops lawyer

215
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,750
with lists with dashi 100,000 and
200,000 random rules and stuff and debug

216
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,929
builds a captures all the rules like
catch and let it sit there for six

217
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:47,429
months just because you can collect all
the balls cleaning off a little bit and

218
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:52,700
smitten to hash canister do not rule out
a couple people here actually have used

219
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,690
this rule apparently it's really really
effective it's more effective than some

220
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:00,090
of the human jeopardy rules but I didn't
do any of this work was just all the

221
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:13,840
machines so the computer smarter than I
am yes render other taxi can do short

222
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,679
but nice article on the khutbah attack
you don't hear from the chinese takeout

223
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:27,600
exactly so what this is is basically
every Chinese restaurants on a twin

224
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,950
dragon Golden Dragon

225
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:37,260
dog etc so is a tool to cut be and it
does is you can get a variable to go

226
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,900
slightly the first aid for us to forest
for last two last day at last for a

227
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,429
script they're actually has in his
website they can run through and collect

228
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:47,830
all the various iterations of this

229
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,490
and then he running through the house
cat statue on attack and it kind of does

230
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,559
a solar-powered slicing techniques as
prefix pending expending call the

231
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,720
chinese takeout attack at work you have
a rule tako da post was fully processed

232
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:08,320
for days to run on my cluster and it
takes 24 character passwords with random

233
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,890
prev expanding expending stuff in the
middle old that's just ridiculous

234
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:19,360
prevent 42 per 40 gigs of ram listen to
it generated aid dash a one half side

235
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,789
it's you get cracked by this you
probably will I'm sorry everyone here

236
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:32,049
knows what Adams Prince attack no one ok
so about a year ago Adam made some

237
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:38,919
software that I remember anyone here in
Toronto crack ISO deprecated kids it

238
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,309
just kind of stopped working so I made a
new variant of it that you have read

239
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:47,690
some rules against modifying your word
lists based on things it's finding so

240
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,630
you'll never run out of stuff to crack
seat on the node and it did the LinkedIn

241
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,870
hashes like 80% of the minute day on
just a single node cluster it but it

242
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,950
does seem pretty intelligent stuff you
throw it on a leave it on it now and he

243
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,429
said it right thing we do is we'll just
try random stuff like 10 expander credit

244
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:10,539
repair run-through permeate combine them
through through rule is expanding Reaper

245
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,510
mute them reruns orkut be basically just
jumbled everything up and throw it out

246
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,510
it and see what sticks against the law

247
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:23,179
it works well on NTLM MDN 5 try random
stuff because you'll spend a lot of time

248
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:29,909
I don't have a cluster this big so
here's the one we all love how I

249
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:34,480
destroyed a crypto economy or
particularly her inner man destroyed a

250
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,429
crypto Tommy I give you all the credit
on this one

251
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:47,129
so we had some idle cycles we had no
jobs rang we didn't mean it since my

252
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:53,580
stuff so we'll see what this whole like
when things about what we're gonna do

253
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,889
chose death quite as a rule of work
where we can't use the cluster for

254
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:02,539
personal gain any way shape or form so I
figured I'd never take off Slauson sure

255
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:08,470
it doesn't take off and use it for
research so Patrick's make great space

256
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,799
heaters they do and great like reminders
that Dixon tweaking in he got the whole

257
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:30,259
thing work in pretty good so random and
his manager so yeah def going came out

258
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:34,269
they released on April 1st so the first
thing I did was like you until i text

259
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:40,330
Jeff bossy and our tendency is actually
legit thing or recently to be leg you

260
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,679
doing are gonna be accidentally mining
for somebody else or something is a

261
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,950
no-no is legit thing you know the
project people ask me about it you know

262
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:56,009
permission to use the name so it's
basically like coin just a variant of

263
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:03,340
like coin saw this and it's like wait
we've got a lot to keep you cycles what

264
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,460
can we do with this like the guy
thinking ok hacker currency coin

265
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,929
everything else is like a playground
your sandbox for all the script a

266
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:21,759
currency stuff well yeah it went
downhill from there so just have this

267
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,470
story is boredom $0.50 per second like
when hash rate which is the only

268
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:35,129
definite yes we mind 750,000 17 45,000
death Quentin three months we were 70 to

269
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:40,759
75 percent of the network cash rate so
noticeable pool was like the largest

270
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,049
ball for the official launch of it yeah
that was basically all US air raid like

271
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:46,149
three or four times

272
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,059
overloaded

273
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,120
we started spreading around school how
to hide it but never forget out of his

274
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,110
US remains debating rolled up in a pimp
suit with a paper wallets the death

275
00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:00,499
credit bathing the players said Nick
Moran in fact we got some pictures here

276
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:06,799
of winter air conditioning failed for
that pool that was the pool house raid

277
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,929
in here was the network cash rate so
pretty significant this was made we had

278
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:16,779
a building wide are accusing failures
running these things pretty hard at the

279
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:20,159
time in facilities was hurting us
because we had alarms went off at three

280
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,279
in the morning as they were killing
building air conditioning in mid-may and

281
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,159
turn it back on its six someone didn't
get the memo

282
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,450
cluster yeah so I had to educate them
and things got fixed up by the figured

283
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,889
you know people wonder why the
difficulty drops of sudden that's

284
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:44,679
exactly why so deafening lessons learned
when making a new crop of currency make

285
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,269
sure its GPU resisting if you make
something for hackers they will hackett

286
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:52,350
we still have the talk to them and they
kinda rejected her talk because we

287
00:23:52,350 --> 00:24:04,860
apparently they wanted to be a thing
yeah your car to work on people like me

288
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,129
we will mess with it I'm sorry first
rule the internet it's gonna get messed

289
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:14,070
with and yeah when you're sweet talk to
DEFCON about this dream interpreter at

290
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:20,039
sea be nice about it and don't shop
diplomacy with senator 50,000 DEFCON in

291
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:28,869
people's wallets crypto cluster lessons
learned have adequate airflow reiterate

292
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:35,019
that have it looked cool air flow if you
think God Himself is coming in a crap

293
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:39,840
ton of errands like hurricane sandy is
your datacenter you might have enough

294
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,690
maybe automate everything

295
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,080
stuff dies you on a bill to handle the
failure automatically because I hate

296
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,360
getting up at three in the morning
because a good note failed that's where

297
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,409
middleware comes in it'll handle failure
for you if you actually has the right

298
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,590
stuff

299
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,159
build your system's correctly don't set
yourself on fire

300
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:07,090
overbilled over spec overbuilt success
is good here makes your building where

301
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,909
she works like actually works not just
feels any random because when one of

302
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:16,179
these expelled we'd actually did destroy
for video cards I've actually a wall of

303
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:24,799
4797 TLC's in my lab that's called the
wall of dead soldiers have a nice trip

304
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,190
cluster controller cables cables to his
pci-express extenders it's a sin and the

305
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,590
church wifi we're adding to the list of
commands and read the manual read the

306
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,289
forums ask questions before I ask
questions please read the manual says

307
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:48,820
I'm not answering the question I need
your rig set my place on fire so credits

308
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,629
been doing for five years I stand on the
shoulders of giants here hey Adam short

309
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:58,860
episode but we sold units ninja every
member team has cat they've all saved my

310
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,230
ass countless times so none of this
would be a possibility without them

311
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,450
Steve where we think of inspiration to
make the anti-war be talk sorry not

312
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,850
sorry and also think my army of solvents
robot overlords you're far more

313
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:21,460
effective than interns I P less than
murdoch so questions I'm evil mark on

314
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:26,399
freenode pound housecat I'm on her shit
forums and Morgan Twitter only during

315
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:31,059
conference season so if you have any
questions at all I might answer the

316
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:36,190
might be snarky answers but I will
answer questions

317
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:53,620
define passively you answer the question
raised there don't don't families now

318
00:26:53,620 --> 00:27:00,870
are you talking about a little families
boxes use a biblical airflow

319
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,259
copy chassis its golden showers should
work but if you don't have the right

320
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,080
airflow these cards will set on fire

321
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,590
the new NVIDIA work out rather well but
if you're using AMD like the seventh and

322
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,009
seventies the 5870 is the 6990 is those
things need a lot of airflow keep them

323
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:21,620
fed keep them happy cuz the little thing
people don't know what these cards they

324
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,429
don't fail immediately they have
creeping errors in your calculations and

325
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:29,889
the basic hangs at PGA hands and the car
starts acting wonky right when they get

326
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:33,929
closer to you but don't quite feel for
another two months afterwards so you

327
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:44,470
have to toss out half-year results so
just keep the cards happy questions no

328
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,169
hell no I'm joining user rack server
going for you or five you at the chamber

329
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:53,860
ones are awesome the times has he said
raid now Supermicro makes really good

330
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,500
jazzy's be a four-year five-year minimum
if you're doing anything problem that

331
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:09,399
most viewed video cards will fit in hud
houses there but also one hundred and

332
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:13,720
thirty Celsius on the card itself and
internally about sixty seventy celsius

333
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:20,380
before they are for kicks and blows a
load

334
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:29,990
two systems Barack total of redoing the
desktop great things in an open shelf

335
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,390
but if you use like the tie and their
five years I can cram the whole damn

336
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:38,460
thing is as long as you have power and
cooling for it there have been some

337
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,690
reports of a guy with 48 you these
things

338
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:49,970
fully crammed fully stocked I don't know
repairable is yeah there is Hurricane

339
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,960
Katrina which has all the info wife's
name so shut up to Katrina thank you I

340
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:04,340
love you don't use PCI splitters to his
PC extenders basically just use the 16

341
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,350
slots and if the card fits in the chance
you're good to go if you have to use an

342
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,430
extender a splitter you're doing it
wrong

343
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,880
Bueller Bueller cool
