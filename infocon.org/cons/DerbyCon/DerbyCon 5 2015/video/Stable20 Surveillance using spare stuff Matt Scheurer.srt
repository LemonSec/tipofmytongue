1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,549
might ever hear me OK excellent alright
thanks for coming I really this is

2
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:14,290
surveillance using spare stuff my name
is match here have a handle of circa

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,890
follow me or send me a tweet on Twitter
I think I had this count for years never

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,240
officially one follower I would welcome
more the copy of the slides around

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,170
SlideShare

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,750
I don't like talking about myself a
whole lot but probably like everybody in

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,070
this room a lot of different things to
you a lot of different people there's a

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,160
number of them right there

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,510
quick disclaimer here the information

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:08,110
so bottom line is if you do something
silly like stocks somebody violate

15
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:14,310
somebody's privacy steal usernames
passwords pins lunch goods don't blame

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,799
me I told you not to do it I'm not a
lawyer but one thing I do understand is

17
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,630
that surveillance laws very very much
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction please

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,240
consult with an attorney familiar with
the laws and ordinances in your area

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:36,909
before conducting any surveillance
activity so how this all got started

20
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:43,549
really was sort of thing where I was
looking at some old smartphones and

21
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,549
thought you know I've got a few of these
they're not really doing anything

22
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,619
they're just sitting in a drawer
collecting dust

23
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,759
there's gotta be something I could do
with them by show he is here have all

24
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,200
smartphones are not currently doing
anything with hands all over the room

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,100
I was one of those people so I started
looking into it

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,580
the side that IP camera sound like a fun
project since it was a spare equipment

27
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:16,870
there is a low cost low barrier to entry
in the reasons you might want to conduct

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,470
surveillance would be to protect
physical assets from threats such as

29
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:30,849
dumpster diving theft vandalism and
destruction dumpster diving has been

30
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:38,420
around for a long time would give you a
means to sort of monitor what's

31
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,390
happening around the the dumpster out
back and also to protect physical

32
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:51,410
barriers or printers from threats such
as lockpicking there are a lot of things

33
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:57,049
you can do with locks the ones with
lighter tones there's more pins offset

34
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:03,560
is a number of things to use or to make
it harder but a determined lockpick

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,549
often get through this is gives you a
chance to sort of see and find out

36
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:16,000
what's happening and perhaps at least if
nothing else have some evidence in

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,459
social engineering filtration if you
find a weird device somehow connected to

38
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,380
your network you think wow how did that
get in this area and maybe you remember

39
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,389
that in your research and development
environment some guy wearing a suit look

40
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,060
completely out of place was walking
through kicked over trash can you tell

41
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:43,420
us sir have a chance to go back look at
your pictures look at your video and try

42
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,720
to figure out what was happening there
and then simply trespassing all things

43
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,160
you can do a surveillance the components
of an effective surveillance system in

44
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,950
my mind consists of centralized
management that's way to manage multiple

45
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,130
cameras in one centralized location

46
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:11,670
monitoring and detection obviously is a
very big de tu sort of tried to force

47
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,860
things in progress

48
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,810
collecting did you or audio capture what
was happening and win very important

49
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,180
alerting us also another key components
you know when in area has been breached

50
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,880
or something is happening but you do
want to try to minimize false alarms

51
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,250
you know it doesn't do a lot of good if
you're getting alerts every two minutes

52
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:44,070
bird flu by you want to try to eliminate
as much noise as possible so you're only

53
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,360
getting word on actual critical events
and finally archival and retrieval

54
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:58,240
another important step to you be able to
have video tortured over the law

55
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:06,640
enforcement as an example were able to
capture a crime as it happened were a

56
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,130
background of this moment but will talk
about some spare low-cost equipme can

57
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,009
use in a

58
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:21,050
surveillance system smartphones old
smartphones are fantastic what makes

59
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,449
them great is a smartphone is
essentially a pocket-sized computer

60
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:32,520
really a smartphone without active
cellular service is very much like an

61
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,349
iPod touch was a number of years ago

62
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,680
generally speaking people who carry two
devices because they have one smartphone

63
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,990
that their current one generally does
most everything they want already but

64
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,409
even the older phones that were not high
in pretty decent video quality to them

65
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:57,969
we're not trying to capture images in
video that is going to be your wedding

66
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:02,270
album or your senior photos were just
trying to get enough detail that we can

67
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:08,759
clearly identify what was happening and
they've all got built-in microphones

68
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:15,669
which is great if you wanna capture
audio and this is a key one built in

69
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:24,050
WiFi support that makes them very easy
to attach to your network to centralize

70
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,189
everything and also they're very easy to
power wall chargers are readily

71
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:35,870
available at external battery packs to
give yourself extended run times they're

72
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,469
even cellular chargers that will help
keep a phone powered where you generally

73
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:46,469
don't have power available only on the
thought it might even be able to run off

74
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:54,039
a USB extension and then oftentimes
they'll support extra storage be an

75
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:59,029
sdcard or if you want to root or
jailbreak your device you can easily do

76
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:03,879
USB to go or some other functions you
extend the internal storage capacity of

77
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:10,569
us in there in conspicuous they can be
hidden in plain sight and so if you walk

78
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,380
into a room

79
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,870
you see yourself that's plugged into a
wall you're generally going somebody is

80
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,510
discharging their phone but you're
probably not thinking is that a this

81
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,980
thing could be recording everything is
happening this room and everything is

82
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:32,720
going on so again just in plain sight
and then spear stuff item or router if

83
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,130
you find yourself upgrading to an AC
called your router or maybe you would

84
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,140
Google do on how to use or to do some
smart routing LA Times you take these

85
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:50,460
all routers install a custom firmware
such as dd-wrt or tomato on the great

86
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,370
thing about writers is that they are
fantastic

87
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:00,320
basically ready traffic between two
networks they lend themselves to network

88
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:08,560
segmentation another spare stuff item is
an old computer and Nord computer may be

89
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,740
repurposed to run Linux was only minor
and we're in touch on Zoom under quite a

90
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,490
bit in the stalk the only real note here
that you might need to beat your system

91
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:25,840
if you're monitoring a very large volume
of cameras as a kind and optional items

92
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,670
certainly not required but if you want
to have sort of night vision for pretty

93
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,690
inexpensive you can use in order
reflector lamp or if you have a little

94
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,840
trouble up in your workshop or garage or
even a floral ample do you can use with

95
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,920
an infrared light bulb just a very
inexpensive way to broadcast a large

96
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,550
amount of IR into an area one word of
caution is the infrared light bulbs are

97
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,920
generally used for heating lamp purposes
so they tend to run hot so if you're

98
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,960
using a layup make sure that the shader
the dome is metal or glass or something

99
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,790
it isn't flammable prone to find
yourself in a situation where you have

100
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,720
that building we want to protect his
nice protected and secure but the

101
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,310
problem is the lamp set the place on
fire and burned to the ground

102
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,899
sort of defeats the purpose of
protecting it

103
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:27,009
and other specified items include all
tablet tablets in dedicated IP cameras

104
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:35,860
the nice thing with these tablets is
it's just a in some regards a larger

105
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,139
smartphone

106
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:42,350
gonna find these things are more
expensive if you want to buy one on the

107
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,259
used market cell phone but a lot of
times you can find these things listed

108
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:54,329
on deal sites auction sites and pick him
up pretty inexpensively

109
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:59,350
hated IP cameras are great what makes
them nice as they have built-in motion

110
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,319
control and a lot of times infrared
built into a big plus

111
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,550
but there's no hard and fast rules on
this there's nothing that says you can't

112
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:18,170
take your surveillance system consisting
of five stalled smartphones tablet three

113
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:24,279
IP cameras use any combination devices
you want you can hire them all so you

114
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:37,600
can mix and match the stuff very easily
yes I personally I think that's the W

115
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,559
8910 but there's a number of good ones
out there these are just the ones i've

116
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:49,139
i've worked with they tend to get pretty
good reviews but Jerry what I found is

117
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:55,209
these things are we too picky is only
got a good quality picture and other

118
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,529
features you're looking for

119
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:07,270
yes

120
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:19,350
yes good point the the better quality
care of the better quality image you're

121
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:25,140
going yet I think for her surveillance
systems the quality is low less critical

122
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,270
zones are capturing the important detail
but certainly there's nothing wrong with

123
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:34,640
getting a better quality image and the
response times on these is generally

124
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:42,880
pretty good night vision actually every
camera is pretty much capable of night

125
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,490
vision infrared lighting alone isn't
going to give your camera night vision

126
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,930
capabilities what you can do though if
you're advantageous in golden as you can

127
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,730
actually disassemble your camera is
usually around the lens will find an IR

128
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:04,350
small IR filter which is a film
plasticky phil has a dark red blue or

129
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,590
purple the issue you might run into you
when you remove entire filter from a

130
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:15,890
camera lens is that during bright light
even normal lighting everything will

131
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,720
turn the whitewash out on the image
quality one worker and do is these

132
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,920
papers are pretty cheap these phones are
pretty cheap you can only have one with

133
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,220
the air filter removed and one without

134
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,320
essentially put two different cameras
and seemed area just sort of work around

135
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,630
those issues he get a dedicated IP
camera like the ones we've discussed

136
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:46,690
then there becomes 79 issue since the
infrared night vision is is built into

137
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:53,360
those devices so using smartphones IP
cameras

138
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,620
there's a lot of free IP Cam apps
available in App Store's that will

139
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,610
eventually turn your smartphone into a
network IP camera

140
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:13,970
generally speaking my mind vices trial
the free ones you want you may like some

141
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,750
may not like others you've got a minimal
investment just a little bit I'm sort of

142
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:25,100
experimenting with you can also buy low
there's some low-cost absecon you read

143
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,450
reviews the try to get an idea that's
going to meet all of your needs

144
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:37,370
these provide a number ways the
hermitage a small number of IP cameras

145
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,769
there's also IP camera monitoring
applications that work well on phones

146
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:49,130
and tablets you can often times on free
or low-cost apps for that as well but

147
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,829
one thing I talked about a lot is so no
wonder if you've never used them under

148
00:13:54,829 --> 00:14:01,829
its a great products essentially a free
video camera security app so we design

149
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:03,540
for low-cost do it yourself

150
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:11,850
video search purity including commercial
or home CCTV prevention child family

151
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:19,000
wandering need him applications it
supports capture analysis recording and

152
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,800
monitoring of video data coming from
cameras attached to a Linux system

153
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,560
messing is we'll talk about the mood
here in a moment but it supports motion

154
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:37,240
detection email alerts in reviewing all
those features are supported the one

155
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,959
drawback was a reminder that doesn't
have integrated audio recording built

156
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,670
into the default application it's a
little bit of a drawback and somebody

157
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,750
here may have a better work around for
this

158
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,480
I found that on the IP Cam outside
played around with will support

159
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,010
streaming to be able see what they do
have you'll see players you can don't

160
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:06,660
that out to a wave file and then later
convert that wave file into some

161
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:14,790
compressed audio format why I think so
minders grade is a lot of the camera

162
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,870
moves so he can go in nine which
essentially just disables a camera from

163
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,410
his own minder the monitor mode
basically as a live streaming mode if

164
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,150
you want to see what's happening

165
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:36,020
record anything motion detection will
capture still snapshots when a motion

166
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,510
detection alarm from the camera goes off

167
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:45,540
recording mode century gives you a
continuous video recording a camera view

168
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:53,910
motion recording her mccord uses motion
triggered events to begin recording and

169
00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:00,710
then no detect for external controlled
triggers and actions have a clear out

170
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,280
that too much

171
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:09,320
understands you can do some custom
events to trigger camera actions so the

172
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,670
important thing to notice these settings
only impact the camerons own minder

173
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:20,120
Cameron doesn't mean the cameras not
actually still capturing the image of

174
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:28,310
what's happening just simply means that
the camera is not being displayed in

175
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,020
minder

176
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:38,380
configure he male wearing a minor
consoling her options in email one thing

177
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:44,910
that might be helpful is to consider say
email address to a distribution that

178
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:51,150
includes your SMS numbers so you get
text alert when I alarm motion alarm is

179
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:57,860
off one of the big things was under what
I think really makes it great and sort

180
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,130
of sets it apart from just sort of

181
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:06,709
playing out cameras need of Lee is that
lets you define hot zones is one of the

182
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,240
keys with using his own minder
successfully is the concept of zones are

183
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,030
essentially an area within an image that
you can define for the purposes of

184
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:21,420
motion detection or even ignoring motion
that helps you minimize false alarms and

185
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,230
what i think is great about this is we
see the car as injuries person as

186
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,870
defined a hot new recording actions
motion detection actions within their

187
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,410
hot for example of something is
happening out in the street you're not

188
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,300
capturing that information it's only
with some approaches the driveway or the

189
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,399
vehicle within that defined hot zone
that the recording begins so some things

190
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll let you do is that will let you are
defined as owner and a door for example

191
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,660
is so you're capturing traffic when
people come in or out of the door but

192
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,430
you're really when that happens you're
capturing everything that happened in

193
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,250
that room at that time so somebody is
trying to pick a lock for example in the

194
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,680
body standing off to the side sort of
serving as a lookout you're getting that

195
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,000
whole view of the room

196
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,950
captured but it's triggered in the event
that you want you're not just getting

197
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:20,170
random passers-by they have me walking
in front the door is very powerful to

198
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:28,280
help minimize those false positives in
getting too many alerts on issues

199
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:34,750
archiving and retrieval and zone minder
the USR share so minor events in images

200
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,290
folders are generally where the data is
stored one option you have is that you

201
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:47,090
can use cloud storage synchronization
like Dropbox for example or any of the

202
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,760
other alternatives out there is actually
you can synchronize those folders

203
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,300
off-site

204
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:01,340
for retrieval later could be important
if your system as all your recording

205
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:07,810
something were to happen it got
destroyed and then just some good

206
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:13,720
practices in general for surveillance
important thing I think when you have an

207
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,840
IP camera is not putting it directly on
the internet last year on security

208
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,070
cameras be used against you talked about
the Foscam systems which I have to be

209
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:31,220
honest with the firmware update email
alerts security is sort of an

210
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:38,930
afterthought on these devices is sort of
have a cure eased against you you might

211
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:45,050
for example set up a home alarm system
to markets have the year home and if you

212
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:51,310
bought that new 72 inch for ka ultra TV
the Fayoum the wall the last thing you

213
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:56,210
want is for somebody else who also has
access to your camera to know when

214
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,630
you're not home when they can come over
and help themselves do it so you don't

215
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,690
want these things be used against you as
a very important point I would recommend

216
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,010
using VPN remote camera monitoring

217
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,730
keeps it directly off the internet gives
you extra added layer of security around

218
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:18,800
that and then generally follow good
network security practices least as much

219
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,980
as you can particularly if you're using
cameras on a wireless network segment

220
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,480
your IP cameras off from the rest your
network with appropriate access controls

221
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,390
in place the default passwords to you
most devices in apps are very well known

222
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,220
so by all means change the default
logins use strong passwords it's a

223
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:47,760
common sense but very important and also
I would condition keeping these off your

224
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,940
network are you doing SNMP monitoring I
would try to

225
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,500
not use the same street as a use on your
other network devices or systems devices

226
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,870
did get compromised you don't want
somebody else to sort of be able to tell

227
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:13,159
instantly what else is going on your
network and and patches and updates we

228
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,809
talked a moment ago about sort of
firmware updates in the importance of

229
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:22,460
them because they come out quite
frequently so keep your camera firmware

230
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:29,769
phone firmware software updated also so
minor folk essentially functions as an

231
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:34,929
appliance you want to remember it's
running a live Linux system so he being

232
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:40,450
that host up to date with patches is
incredibly critical because once that

233
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,970
systems compromise then everybody has
access not just your cameras but your

234
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:53,639
archives as well so just always remember
that and that's really about all I have

235
00:21:53,639 --> 00:22:01,279
a lot of people I will thanks for
helping make this possible and we're

236
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,740
running short on time but I have time
for maybe a question or two if anybody

237
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:12,980
has any alright well I think that's it
then thank you for attending enjoy the

238
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,590
rest of the conference
