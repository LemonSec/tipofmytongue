1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,450
as TV talk quickly

2
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:54,610
start or wait

3
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:04,300
have they been closing doors when your
sister I don't know how behind it as

4
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:24,750
other people starting are you ready to
go so I'm going wow that's pretty

5
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,940
enthusiastic goodness gracious lots of
people are coming in here today I'm

6
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,030
talking about problems in the
information security industry that's a

7
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:41,569
theme to say I haven't noticed of the
people who talk about the problems very

8
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:46,890
many answers to many of the problems
they bring up I'm gonna talk about the

9
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,850
art and science of communicating with
your developers this is a problem with

10
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,840
easy answers but it requires a certain
level of understanding from someone with

11
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,670
their foot in both camps and there just
aren't very many of those people I

12
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,170
happen to be one of them over who I him
in a minute

13
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:15,280
the nice thing about this is that it is
a series of problems that are really

14
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,400
clear to understand have social
implications but potentially solutions

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,060
can solve some of the really big
problems that were spoken about the

16
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,690
panel yesterday morning how many people
were the opening

17
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,600
I was really good wasn't I'd love to do
that some of the developer conferences

18
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,060
get some security people out do that so
I mean explain his problems from the

19
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,180
Middle that's where I live between
development security and then we all

20
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,710
talk about the solutions that i've
encountered so far so because of that

21
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,670
unlike my normal talks if you've heard
me speak before I I don't normally mind

22
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,410
this time right now in your questions
because I'm probably an answer in the

23
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,080
second half

24
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,590
alright so developers are difficult to
communicate with the reason too

25
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:07,120
difficult to communicate with us because
we have more telling them that despite

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,260
what their users say that their coats
socks and as it turns out they don't

27
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,430
care for their kids like telling them
their bibi is ugly

28
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,060
many of these developers that you're
working with on a day-to-day basis

29
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,540
consider themselves artists and very
reasonably so development is an art it

30
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,900
is very techincal but it is an art in
these people pour a lot of their own

31
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,690
energy into the code especially the good
ones but even the good ones make

32
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,860
security vulnerabilities in their coat
and it's our job to tell them about

33
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,230
those in this is what they go and do
afterwards

34
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,760
we've got to solve the problem 89% of
recent recent breaches that have

35
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,760
resulted in data loss or in some way to
do it is a big part it isn't everything

36
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,050
that is always web apps that are the
problem but it is a major problem that

37
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,190
we have to be dealing

38
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,739
someone had to write the code that
caused the breaches we are the people

39
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:15,260
who get to talk to those people so
that's what we're gonna talk about money

40
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,660
is built on Twitter that's what they
asked for my name I used to be an IRC

41
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,260
fanatic I spent a lot of time talking
chatting on IRC I enjoy that quite a bit

42
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,410
but I have switched over to Twitter even
though it's a little too hipster

43
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:35,490
did I do something wrong even a little
too hipster for me in a lot of ways

44
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,950
because its global conversation I love
that I love to chat about this stuff I

45
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,810
love to bring up idea so if you're a
person followed me in and let's chat

46
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,130
about application security I'm husband
my way to actually attend easier for the

47
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:53,440
first time in three or four years
sitting there between social engineering

48
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,420
and talks and whatnot

49
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,230
many of the camera couldn't get up this
morning to the home school and so we

50
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,240
hope that the father of two young
children that's just heartwarming to see

51
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,770
the kids want around here

52
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,010
of my youngest to sport a little young
to really get anything out of it my

53
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,990
oldest is 10 at Circle City Khan
attended her kids and is still talking

54
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,300
about the wifi hacking clinic it was
your house I mean he'll tell any anybody

55
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,100
who asks about he's sitting in scouts

56
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,930
else talking to people about wifi
hacking and they're like so didn't have

57
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:36,560
the password that you did have expressed
in Birmingham the one widely bottom in

58
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,790
2004 I moved to that end zone 16 books
and software development starting with

59
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,220
the earliest dotnet looks back in ninety
nine and finished up most recently with

60
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,470
a Windows 8 Store apps book we all know
how that went it was a fun book to write

61
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,540
a software composer

62
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:02,950
term because of a second term architect
coder which isn't exactly I'm not great

63
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,770
term from a book called lorem ipsum
lorem Ipsum is a hundred and thirty-six

64
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,810
pitched children's book about software
engineering and frankly I learned more

65
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,520
in this book that I didn't so if you
have a chance to pick it up at your son

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,290
or daughter and learn something yourself
in the book Lauren travels through the

67
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,190
skin tactically and with these towns are
all based on software engineering

68
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,090
principles both good and bad for
instance Saunders the waters who piled

69
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,640
walks off to build houses when it
collapsed to the only PayPal more rocks

70
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,310
on top of them

71
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,050
I'm but then there's the composer's this
beautiful land with with his late Terry

72
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,100
spires and the people who do the work

73
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,590
composers because the big beautiful
things and that is what I do I stand on

74
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,000
the shoulders of giants

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,530
coat that other people have written and
private with code that I have written in

76
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,100
meet beautiful things that is what I
like to do most recently the application

77
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,880
vulnerability doesn't even fit on the
damn slide does it well this is what we

78
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,950
call everything pen testing right

79
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,990
the fact is there's a bit of a
difference between pen testing and

80
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,100
vulnerability investors have a very
difficult job they're given a goal at

81
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,840
the password file then they have to
write down how they did it they have to

82
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,950
use a wide range of skills from
lockpicking to driving the secretary to

83
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,740
leading us he's outside and getting show
of workstations all these different

84
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,040
things on the other hand are given one
application and are asked to find every

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,960
flaw and that is what I do I take one
application and everything that I read a

86
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,230
report in a way that's harder because of
interest really only one way to find all

87
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,850
of them in a way it's easier for
instance I'm very rarely threatened with

88
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,510
jail

89
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:53,570
sometimes so personally I'm home I bring
for many years I recently but i just ask

90
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,720
anybody here happens no friendly
friendly used to be the risk

91
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:14,750
guy for PNC Bank and I have had the
pleasure of working with leaders in fact

92
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,689
in Columbus

93
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:20,439
John Schneider who I think stuck in the
back here recently moved to Texas like

94
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,489
that to take over the Columbus locks
Power Systems join us we meet at the

95
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:32,120
boundary I am a ninja throwing I need
actually fifty been to Japan in July

96
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,899
study for a number of years and it's not
just a martial art there's a lot of

97
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,259
stuff concepts involved in it that I
find very handy in this industry

98
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:46,750
constructionist I have a habit of saying
exactly exactly the wrong time as it

99
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,480
turns out this is a huge benefit and
security business whereas it was quite a

100
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,790
problem in the in the development
industry so so there's react that's who

101
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:03,850
I am so let's talk about what's wrong
with a pretty large collection of things

102
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,209
that's wrong but don't get depressed on
me

103
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,389
will soon moved its solutions and the
solutions are much easier than you think

104
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:16,740
there's a breakdown in communication
between information security ok the

105
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:25,139
program the stuff and us as security
people have this gap in court things

106
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:30,279
that I will go over the first is the
security is concerned about risk whereas

107
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:36,199
developers are concerned about usability
ok the second is that security sees

108
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:40,949
things in terms of vulnerabilities
whereas developer see things in terms of

109
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:46,920
defects the third thing is that security
has an unnatural kind of shocked truck

110
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,920
will catch you later when it comes to
severity of things

111
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,879
severity of finding and the fourth is
that there's something of a culture

112
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,720
break between the people who participate
in the people who participate in the

113
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,970
development industry

114
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,819
I'm not gonna lie this middle section of
the talk is Travis panorama a little bit

115
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:08,730
because I deal with this on both sides

116
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,579
every single day and it's a little
frustrating so is part of the reason why

117
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:19,269
this talk exists if you think you drink
because you try being a developer in

118
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:26,519
InfoSec there is a reason why oo has
lasts with their logo on its ok it

119
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:42,009
doesn't get worse problem risk back

120
00:10:42,009 --> 00:11:05,009
developers are just trying to make
something that's what they want their

121
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:14,889
vehicle and save your passwords wrong
user is in our system security says who

122
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:25,279
are right we we get upset about this
write-up they see what we did I'm trying

123
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,509
to do something next to the user I'm
trying to trying to make it so that they

124
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:33,240
know what the pics too bad they can
harvest user names using that gotta get

125
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,879
rid of it

126
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,740
generic error message for this I don't
care what the problem clickjacking

127
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,899
another one you know all they want to
say it's allow people to frame their

128
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:51,439
site if they need to we see didn't you
see kaminsky talk black right it's not

129
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:56,920
if you don't know jack and jackie is you
a redress vulnerability and more or less

130
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,500
what you what I can do the developers I
can if I can dream your site I take my

131
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,449
able site not come up with an iframe on
top of your site in internet with with

132
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:06,279
CSS

133
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:13,069
sheets but I put my site under he shows
through I push my buttons strategically

134
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:16,949
where your buttons would be if we are
looking to do something transfer money

135
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:21,139
changing password change email address
whatever delete all your emails in the

136
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,069
example here provide a bunch of Monaco
and also you can do things like putting

137
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:33,110
invisible iframe on top of potential
deal on top of a free speech that then

138
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,800
collects your credentials so I put
invisible deal on top of your login

139
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,730
login it actually goes to my server and
then I just redirect to the real lock

140
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,660
right so it's a real possibility I like
I said Dan Kaminsky literally did a talk

141
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:53,490
on black hat it's on YouTube watching
its really good but it's just losing

142
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,480
potentially losing user names one of the
time and it's just it requires a

143
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,959
phishing attack and it's just not that
severe and the devs just want to let

144
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,249
people from the site

145
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:11,720
institution and this is a great one
across a scripting normally but you know

146
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,800
those times you just can't get the
popular sure why work shows it's there

147
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,399
you can see very clearly and Jason
response like this but they've got their

148
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,379
content types that the Jason and there's
just no place in the application returns

149
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,970
and scripting but she still wanna write
up here I have insufficient

150
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,800
implementation will this means that the
developers to go and find all of these

151
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,459
weird imports of this API and do a ton
of crap to it later this is why they

152
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:40,519
don't like you

153
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:47,120
another example of these crypto
vulnerabilities b2 and b3 r/c for safer

154
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,059
all that traffic cure your whatever page
or you know Automobile Parts research

155
00:13:54,059 --> 00:14:04,550
page was going to do this this yet its
PCI and they require us to do tomorrow

156
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:11,089
even the fact is one phone call today
helped is 100 million times more

157
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,190
effective than trying to decrypt the T
lest I forget somebody's credentials

158
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:24,920
frankly it's probably more effective
than any getting somebody's it's just

159
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,510
not small-scale her abilities get picked
on yet we write them up to be like he's

160
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:39,170
nice PCB reports to explain our interest
then the devs see it year after year

161
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,720
after year and they keep going back to
visit people say people talking about

162
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:51,180
this doesn't make any sense to me at all
so there in lies the problem with these

163
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,640
sources do we really need to be talking
vulnerabilities presenting more should

164
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:04,420
we be talking about bugs in software
defects they don't care about that meets

165
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,459
your day with the chain exploit they
just want to know what's wrong with

166
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:12,529
their codes they can fix it but yet all
of our templates in reporting your setup

167
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:17,520
to describe the vulnerabilities yes it's
true some developers kinda get that

168
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,200
forbidden knowledge to induce 2010 the
dark side of its own and it shows up in

169
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,660
training which will talk about a little
bit later but for the most part what we

170
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,089
need to be doing is putting our reports
in such a way that they can be entered

171
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,970
in the bucket the bug tracking tracking
system which is jerry is a defect

172
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,290
tracking system for me with it if you're
not you should be a look at that a

173
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:45,250
minute to this is gonna be a kind of a
big sea change will talk about it

174
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:53,040
section of the thirty pieces right we
really want to shock people with the

175
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,870
severity of our abilities we label
security specific get the attention of

176
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,529
Management ok and also frankly it's
easier to back off than it is to push it

177
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,940
up we realize it's worse than we thought
so we have good reasons for doing this

178
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,610
but it's got

179
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:14,649
a little extreme and you have to read
your seat 944 site for high because of

180
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:25,180
PCI but you really know about that man
that's how many they just care and were

181
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:32,800
reading too many things hi it's just
what we were creating this just just

182
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,360
blind spot in the developers they just
don't see this is what we look like to

183
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,070
them okay and there's a good reason
because that is what we look like you

184
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,750
get the idea

185
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,610
one last thing to

186
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,680
doesn't really have any solutions but I
think require some understanding is that

187
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,240
there is something of a dramatic
personality difference between the kind

188
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,760
of people who do development and the
kind of people who do information

189
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,780
security sometimes just find it two
different categories of people don't

190
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,709
have enough in common data meaningful
conversation and this is one of those

191
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:14,839
cases there's not a lot we can do about
that you probably all no one of those

192
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:20,589
men right Chris Dickerson of course you
don't know him he should be able to stop

193
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:27,020
hands woman who is kind of the pool of
Microsoft

194
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,220
fool the justice s brilliant technology
is also a trained mediator guy and

195
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,520
stand-up comic in his talks are amazing
mind blowing never seen two different

196
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,400
person if they were in the same room
there might be like an issue and they

197
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,820
pretty much mark a lot of the chasm
between development interests there's

198
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,120
not a lot we can do about that the
careers draw different kinds of people

199
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,440
pay the reason why I'm in both is
because I'm so socially awkward doesn't

200
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,820
matter anyway anybody so because of that
kind of in with everybody but thank you

201
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,750
but I know normal people

202
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,160
they work with people best to sit with
them best

203
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:15,700
normal people so yeah so that culture of
violence itself another whole category

204
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,580
of problems right there's a different
language a little bit but is a community

205
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,310
department whatever we're not just our
customers who are the developers in many

206
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,630
cases understand right we ask yourself
questions equipment to receive a Taser

207
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,640
inputs a few percent in just another
readout call and remembered that

208
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,970
reflected cross-site scripting was in
the last report and the one before that

209
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:51,380
and the Liberal Arts will explain why
program is really really have you tried

210
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,260
and I don't mean Python scripting
autonomously module I mean in a

211
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,850
structured environment in a statically
typed language with libraries given to

212
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,500
you by architects that left the company
years ago with the style guide with

213
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,750
five-year-old development tools and then
make the software work and make it

214
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,520
secure

215
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:20,930
it's not easy to do and then you got
people to please and thank you for your

216
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:33,580
understanding as it turns out developers
heavy schedule the features they have to

217
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,630
implement a certain time if certain way
this is what it looks like ok we need to

218
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,550
do no matter what whether its
months-long traditional documented cycle

219
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:49,020
or weeks-long actual super quick let's
get use your card and a pencil cycles of

220
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,750
hipsters do you know you always have to
decide how it's gonna do it decide how

221
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,110
we're going to convince the damn
computer to do it for us to test it out

222
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,630
there keep it working and eventually get
rid of those things happen every time no

223
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,020
matter what and guess what's gonna
happen when you walk in the middle of a

224
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,460
cycle and say these books for next
deployment

225
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:19,640
they just aren't going to do it it's not
even that they don't want you

226
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:26,789
the fact is very very rigid even if you
actually get all these supposedly a

227
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:32,840
judge was to be able to move around but
it's not very structured developers are

228
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,779
very structured

229
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:38,059
software tools are very structured
throwing a document them in the middle

230
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:43,940
of the cycle isn't gonna get you
anywhere and we simply as a community

231
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,539
understand that instead we get buy-in
from business it is that I have a whole

232
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:55,460
sex right solutions but I couldn't
resist using the slide saying we need to

233
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,440
find someone who can prioritize the
security problems on the business side

234
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,799
solve this problem

235
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,610
need to understand the dats Yi
developers business side not unlike a

236
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,950
normal social engineering right you just
gotta find the people who actually make

237
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:18,110
the important thing to on the language
side you need to understand the platform

238
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,510
for developers are building and I've got
the big players in in in big boxes with

239
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,649
the fact is in Java there's a really big
difference between jelly beans in like

240
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:34,159
WebSphere that you have to understand
what the platform is if your asp.net

241
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,190
webforms UMBC

242
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,669
version of NBC Ron do you know what that
implies you need to truly understand

243
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:47,630
that and I don't mean you let you know
you watched the launch video and

244
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,320
investing in something like that I mean
actually understand development tools

245
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,370
installed on your workstation oh im
sorry I forgot to put those are the ones

246
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,720
I was talking about earlier

247
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,010
so yes the big players right so we know
what the problems are now right we've

248
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,520
got culture rift we've got language
problems mostly about naming and

249
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,730
severity but other things too and
there's generally a lack of mutual

250
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,610
understanding these are all social
problems and most of his part really

251
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,169
solid social people so what are we gonna
do exactly

252
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:35,850
well there's three things you need to
focus ok first second is well everything

253
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:41,990
else the stuff we shouldn't talk to me
right in the third trying to find ways

254
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:50,570
to hone their relationships without
having to be a psychologist social

255
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:59,510
engineering to understand the problems
to social problems in order to implement

256
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:06,710
solutions you need to have maps the
relationships I mean I don't mean you

257
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,809
need to necessarily start a month ago
file on your company may not be aware my

258
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:20,380
idea frankly so let's start with enemies
so it's odd to me what we can so much of

259
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,860
the stuff ends up being done by hand or
just ignored because we have the

260
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:30,980
machines doing the wrong things right
where we can we just need to script it

261
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,860
and forget it

262
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:40,110
the effort requires joint work between
InfoSec and development because you

263
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:47,620
don't know where they're built server is
and they don't have any idea when you

264
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:53,360
got to work together the first thing you
wanna do is give them the tools to do

265
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,370
their job

266
00:23:54,370 --> 00:24:01,440
ok make sure developers and QA have
security tools at their disposal

267
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,539
one of the smartest things I've ever
done is give that way it's free it's

268
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:16,570
good because you a people goodwin's
really get off on software just like we

269
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,350
do they just do it a little differently
they want to bring it from the business

270
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,639
process ID but if you shown that the way
the fact that you can take Japanese

271
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:28,610
characters in there and you shouldn't be
able to probably means you can't right

272
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:37,309
ankle brace should look what you can do
that all that slick let's look for some

273
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:42,879
more right there aren't enough upset
people getting this little more later

274
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:49,740
this is how we make more ok declining
Columbus did training said hey we're

275
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,129
still exists here to use a security
training awesome is there to wait while

276
00:24:54,129 --> 00:25:01,899
I was jus is already testing your apps
shouldn't they be looking at security St

277
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:07,269
should Cartwright QA shows up at two
locations that group in Cleveland and

278
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:12,470
Columbus reviewing all the stuff in the
training gives training dilemmas awesome

279
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:19,169
afterwards but I need to know that
someone to read up about and you get

280
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:22,559
that book thanks love least 88 people in
the room

281
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,500
kept me there for an hour asking
questions how do I type this in my

282
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:33,260
testing session how we built can we
integrate this with the right now

283
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:42,340
the really good ones like I said I
already like to bring the song when they

284
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,310
really very much enjoy finding new ways
to solve the problems they face every

285
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,830
day

286
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,840
fantastic they already know how to use
the lower probably and yes well tools

287
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,610
this is just a slightly better version
from our perspective that's all it is

288
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:03,040
then on the development side of things
get people using Python to automate

289
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,320
their tools

290
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,700
amazed how many really phenomenally
talented developers don't know any

291
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,450
scripting I dot net Java Ruby is
technically scripting language I guess

292
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,820
but the greatest intestine code but if
they need to whip something up real

293
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,870
quick to move some files over here and
check the integrity of them the right to

294
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,420
counsel and see sorry I was one of those
people for 15 years I kid you not I

295
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,800
always I mean we back in the Daniel
Pearl back in the early nineties but

296
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,710
when perot kinda fell out of favor and
it all diverted and everything got

297
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:42,220
messed up I just kind of built
everything in its charm so giving giving

298
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,650
developers the tools and showing them
how to use the tool to automate tasks

299
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,630
that should be fairly straightforward is
a great start towards aiming towards

300
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:57,320
more secure coaches you can check things
you can you can modify things you can

301
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,790
take care of your source code better
with the two like Python you can with

302
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:08,140
many other things and it's not just for
the right home builder deployments if

303
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,490
you don't wanna get a big fancy to like
optimist or something like that

304
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,840
to do what to do with big large-scale
deployment training medium-sized

305
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,450
shopping you looking to see twelve
thousand dollars a year a lot just my

306
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:24,600
code but you need something for
deployment to end up moving up the web

307
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,670
config file in your comments and your
javascript and we find your developers

308
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,809
names looking up on Stack Overflow not
that whatever happened that

309
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:37,080
deployment scripts are good to see your
deficit people probably already python

310
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,499
is this anyway but get that tire right
make sure that the developers understand

311
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:53,299
what they can do with those tools
analysis is a good counterpoint to this

312
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,210
ok tools for the people are good too

313
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,440
machines are even better right automate
ourselves a little bit of staff in-house

314
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,970
testing program at rest or at rest

315
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:11,730
looking at the source code for potential
death that the reason why this is there

316
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,889
gonna they're gonna push back if you try
to implement it

317
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:19,659
the reason why is because its most often
used for style checking which no to

318
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:23,590
developers agree on all right where you
could truly braces tapped her state's

319
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:28,779
all that stuff but it's very very
powerful tool for security check under

320
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:34,179
some circumstance so there's a lot of
good tools and I am NOT going to go

321
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,249
vermont certainly go walk around in the
vendors will be more than happy to talk

322
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:41,769
to you about static analysis however
there aren't very many free tools

323
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:46,860
because static analysis is a development
tool and what we learn about development

324
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,549
it's hard very hard

325
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:55,899
only recently actually have the tools
become any kind of these recently maybe

326
00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:00,990
in the past six seven years I personally
have used to fortify which now owned by

327
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,009
HP I he's their code check marks and I
like them all for different things in

328
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:10,320
different kinds of shops you're gonna
have to do some analysis on what's best

329
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,590
for you but use the vendors developers
like bankers security people hate him

330
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,119
because everybody's coming to us saying
one thing but internet working to solve

331
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:19,950
all your problems

332
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:25,070
new developer told us that developer
tool vendors are very very unfocused he

333
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,779
wasn't here is a plugin for Visual
Studio give you access to release of

334
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:34,580
security source control modules and it's
only $150 victory and that's that's how

335
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,770
it works with death I was shocked when I
started moving into the urban street

336
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:44,310
fifty years ago or so how much everybody
hated the vendors I understand why but

337
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:49,090
it's not like that for depp's so what
does static analysis tools do well the

338
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,780
first thing that you will see check your
input validation right they can look and

339
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,850
make sure that you aren't so input
sources and we have six where this input

340
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,210
comes from and where it could go the
delegates reflected back on the screen

341
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,340
to process my backend system or whatever
it's relatively easy for automated

342
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,920
system to discover that now they can
make false positive we'll talk about

343
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,460
that a minute but it is relatively easy
to find we talk about bounds checking

344
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,710
reports overflow problems were counting
is involved computers are very good

345
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,920
accounting they're very good at looking
at source code figuring out he made a

346
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,190
mistake with your cult are also very
good at finding deprecated code and this

347
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,580
is where it's really interesting David
libraries all algorithms incorrect

348
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:35,580
encryption all pieces even when you're
using parts of the language that there's

349
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,750
a better version for static code
analysis time those very very easily

350
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:48,710
however you have to have a triage
process if you run veracode in throwing

351
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,480
three hundred page report over the walls
of the developers it will get thrown

352
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,050
away I have done it a hundred and fifty
times in my career

353
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:07,300
literally just thrown the report way
click Delete I just it doesn't do me any

354
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,800
good it's p

355
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:18,460
will this might be time for the man I
got features I've got a place where

356
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,190
we're trying to figure this already got
to do a story cards for the next sprint

357
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,360
I don't have time for this

358
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,900
you must do triage you must do triage
and then translated into something

359
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,510
developers will understand we'll talk
about it automatic game image analysis

360
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:43,470
is good at certain things to write so we
all want to just skin running out what

361
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:48,240
they need scanning those uses a template
of a site so many people here who is

362
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,200
purposely or is it a crazy with it so
sweet

363
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:01,340
the idea is you generate a sitemap you
use the site as a user would it find all

364
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,640
the content putting real data

365
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,900
remembers everything you said all the
requests then you say ok look good in a

366
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,970
spider anything else that discovers and
you look through those in so many other

367
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,640
floors then you say here's the
interesting forms of interested in those

368
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,990
can go and look for certain things that
binds well based on the dealy you

369
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,080
provided so it's not completely you have
to set up a template first but once

370
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:35,010
you've done it so automatic looking at
output encoding the other side of

371
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,679
community action Sunday people are going
to figure out how to really put that

372
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:43,630
together and genuinely able to find all
the way across its gonna happen someday

373
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:50,210
but if that can happen to their very to
discovering information disclosure ok

374
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:57,169
we're your your API is leaking per
account numbers or developers names in

375
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:02,880
comments or birth dates or credit card
numbers and said that already or new to

376
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,840
the slightly don't

377
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:12,679
discovering exceptions ok so it it's
scanning your state it generates

378
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,750
exceptions and look I got an exception
back in his source code in it

379
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,289
see that and report back to you would
take you forever to do that manually

380
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:25,440
choose you have to look at every single
response but it does it very quickly so

381
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,850
anything is very response to another
question is something you can find very

382
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:36,059
well off problems to request forgery and
application no indication of those kinds

383
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:42,330
of pieces of stuff the stuff that the
machine finds well once again there's a

384
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,020
human element here you absolutely must
reoffer just like with the source code

385
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,820
scanning if you screw over the static or
dynamic analysis report you will get

386
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,679
thrown away I have thrown away more of
these I have my guarantee you it's just

387
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:01,890
not useful by itself you must have a
triage process in place so that leads to

388
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,270
another way of looking at this sometimes
the human has to drop I know I just a

389
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:15,200
bunch of human task but sometimes things
done by rehearsal

390
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:23,649
so the reason why humans are needed for
some of this is because of insight we

391
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:29,490
can make connections that the machine
simply can't make like cross-site

392
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:34,919
scripting we can make the connection
Emily between the input which destroyed

393
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:39,349
do well and output which the dynamic
skinner's do well we can do that

394
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:44,389
ourselves so there's some things that
need to be done by a person pen testing

395
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:47,339
is the obvious one what is interesting
or application vulnerability analysis

396
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:54,089
which isn't that interesting there see
my entry was good for something it is

397
00:34:54,089 --> 00:35:05,119
dynamic and there's there's anything
else that's what one really knows

398
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,480
something's only human is gonna see only
a human is going to look at that get

399
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,270
that post for this get and say I wanna
what happens when you get that number of

400
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,650
machines not gonna do that she has a
preset list of putting it just came in

401
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:26,460
there and report on the results it is
not gonna think the seven but we know

402
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,440
what happened to me that the seven you
get the next Facebook user try it

403
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:30,930
sometime

404
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:37,880
UCP over someone's 2018 you can read a
Python script 11 lines down everybody

405
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:47,910
human is going to go find helpers named
in an XML file comment on Stack Overflow

406
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:53,680
and find new machines gonna do that only
human can do this

407
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,890
ok there's some things to do humans too
well but the fact is you're still gonna

408
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,910
have to explain results cause of
quarters are over there following their

409
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,310
little process cutting tools on it if
you give them that Pinterest even though

410
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,349
the dentist reporters only three pages
like 300 pages they're still gonna throw

411
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:17,630
away because it's written in languages
and you need to fix that also remembers

412
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,760
third-party testers will not understand
your environment you must take that into

413
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,450
consideration ok they're not going to
know the different tiers of your

414
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,510
application

415
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:32,510
what the OP services for the fact that
some of them don't matter of public

416
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,290
teasing there's a dozen examples
sometimes you can go a long relationship

417
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:43,390
with a vendor sometimes but frankly most
of the time to report a black box in

418
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,960
that doesn't make it any easier for the
developers reports really don't

419
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,060
understand is the person who wrote the
report didn't understand the bed people

420
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:59,800
just because they're so we've got
automated static analysis automated

421
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,500
dynamic analysis me with an image
analysis the last manual static analysis

422
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,849
which is personal code review I talked
about last topic overview and this is

423
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:14,349
something to Debs do anyway all you need
to do is insert your own code review

424
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:22,109
under a discrete list are short discrete
list of things to look for

425
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:27,300
not not like let's talk actually short

426
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,089
humans check the things that they can do
well make sure that the access control

427
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:36,270
meets the standard make sure it's
encrypted properly looked back doors the

428
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,050
developers of last cause those are
unlikely to be found accidentally fired

429
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:44,069
stacked or dynamic tools you know when
the devs leave the company they're gonna

430
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:46,430
remember there there and show their
friends on Friday night after I had a

431
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,920
couple drinks trust me it happen

432
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,720
making sure to properly secure service
call talking the database server

433
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,750
security and things like that that stuff
it's much easier for a human to just

434
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:05,160
look for that term she defined so fine
rescue here's your application and most

435
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,950
importantly logging never something to
the tools were gonna find for you in any

436
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,900
case but absolutely so important when
you're dealing with disaster Recovery

437
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:22,450
Minister Gerry key to make sure logging
poses teens humans have foresight

438
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,880
ahead and think about potential issues
they can run into it you fix the

439
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,710
problems before they occur

440
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:39,150
your life is so much better

441
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,820
next door by the way which I would
totally be in his doctor wasn't giving

442
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,710
one so this is the first route first but
I'm gonna watch when it when it gets so

443
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:53,180
as it turns out there's a list for this
alright the product of top 10 it's an

444
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,050
awesome project how many people know
what all is OK

445
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:00,650
half asleep or don't know so tell you
what's the open web application security

446
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,490
project it's a non-profit international
organization that is entirely designed

447
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,190
to do what I'm doing right now which is
spread the word about what up what up

448
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,590
the security there specifically about
spreading at the developers were I try

449
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,860
to do both come up here and say is a
developer and talk to the security

450
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:22,210
people in her so so they have projects
in place and also local chapter meetings

451
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:29,090
which are you going to is there Luva
lost chapter in Louisville lost chapter

452
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:35,200
there's the chapter leader of the
Louisville off after go see him after my

453
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:45,650
talk so the pro pro ActiveX controls for
development Jimmy echo chamber and kitty

454
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,790
in a casket out many of us just made it
up myself included and what they are is

455
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,150
a list of security techniques should be
included in the design every single

456
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:02,390
project ok so what are we talking about
here we're talking about you know one of

457
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,460
the first to the first two are we would
call him

458
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:09,230
scripting see projections mean injection
right but just spoken language

459
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,420
these are the things that you have
talked about privatizing queries

460
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:19,100
encoding down in the first three great
indication authorization and access

461
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,600
control me about thirty US top ten year
the are implementing appropriate access

462
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,080
controls establish identity right
protecting privacy then we get well

463
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,250
logging talked about that earlier but
then we get into the architectural

464
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:36,140
sightings leveraging security features
of your framework because you know all

465
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,380
know you're framework because you listen
to the beginning of the top and we found

466
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,079
out

467
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,450
includes the security specific
requirements in your carpets gathering

468
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:50,209
design architect security in these are
the controls you can use as for sites

469
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:57,890
are talking about the digital divide
earlier and there's a real social

470
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,420
divisions in the second evidence true
and none of us are probably not a good

471
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,910
social and social people were good
engineers advantage of vulnerabilities

472
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,519
humans building relationships are
sometimes hard for this community things

473
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:16,049
like this are fantastic but not always
even with this have the skills are a lot

474
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:23,670
of looks leading developers notes it
just works well with so many things for

475
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,680
instance training which we all have to
do or get done

476
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,839
deaths listen better when they're fed
it's true and not just pizza we've all

477
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,680
had peter the dot net users group and
stuff i mean good food I had a lot of

478
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,829
luck with a pattern like this we start
out with some security principals right

479
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:47,430
minimize tax service areas establish
secure the whole release privilege

480
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:53,670
defense in depth deal securely all the
things that are standardized matter here

481
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,309
and then turn that into testing your own
stuff right training with with said

482
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:03,369
attack proxy understanding with the
attack postures are and then finally we

483
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:08,599
try to secure coding look at what your
platform are four star security how best

484
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:11,469
to implement it roll that back in the
security principal just keep going

485
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:15,739
around in a circle around in a circle
where do you find materials for this

486
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:20,469
send you back to all those search for
training Charles you might wanna try to

487
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:23,529
just go to Google and say oh i paint
ariel's

488
00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:30,160
all of medical slides up there you can
use them to do the training freedom

489
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:37,789
you'd be surprised how receptive them
very hard to find application security

490
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:38,560
people

491
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:45,460
recent client of mine one of their
people that worked out last funny

492
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,810
because one of the people who worked for
that company sitting in the crowd on

493
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:53,280
trying not to look at it and they they
tried to hire somebody with using their

494
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,030
own recruiting group in and it didn't
work as well and so they did what most

495
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:02,480
complete doing you know blasted out to
the world everything I got 46 phone

496
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,900
calls and six weeks for the position
because my title on LinkedIn for six

497
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,970
years has been application security
architect which as it turns out that's

498
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:16,410
turned into the term for what those
people do I don't either the application

499
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:22,450
to people who do get sex stuff finally
the guy called me directly

500
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:28,350
the recruiter at the company he just
come help us out so I can help and it's

501
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:34,150
good stuff actually a lot of my eye I
have many people understand offended by

502
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:39,980
the way I'm just a myself together I'll
run our company we just meet her and I

503
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:47,710
mean you're so the fact is that we have
to make more abstract people there

504
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:53,630
aren't enough of them we knew train them
you find that they like it if you did

505
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,450
you teach don't just train

506
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:01,090
actually you all over this wouldn't be
any training like that of all this you

507
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,960
must love it

508
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:15,950
wire right we're just holding tools for
people to do cool things on the internet

509
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,509
right

510
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:21,519
we're trying to effectively solve the
same problems developers trying to meet

511
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:26,509
users lives better with their software
to protect your wants to make sure that

512
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:31,380
the people that uses offered to get
screwed you know I'm on both those camps

513
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,699
sometimes I don't get along with me

514
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:38,719
ok I understand how this all works but
the fact is the social skills aren't

515
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:45,689
really our thing but we need to least
understand what the developers are going

516
00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:51,449
through when was the last time you used
your developer tools for developers used

517
00:44:51,449 --> 00:44:57,679
walk in their footsteps truly right do
you know which hospital systems have

518
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,529
asked right now to go into the system
and get the production version could you

519
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:07,749
look at the coat ok I'm seems Nottingham
that makes me happy with it if you don't

520
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:15,479
do that so where does this leave us we
didn't talk talk because it's too long

521
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,359
as it is only have a couple minutes left

522
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,119
that's a whole other thing but when I
found her usual is really a three-part

523
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,449
thing that kind of breaks into four
parts I like this graphic for it at the

524
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:29,269
top we start to get the architecture on
both sides and poultry ok which will do

525
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:37,829
next year then static analysis both
automated and manual and dynamic

526
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:42,319
analysis both automated and manual all
wrapped around a soft chewy middle of

527
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,380
training ok this is how we start to
build some kind of a social dynamic a

528
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:53,869
technical solution to a social problem
we build things that the developers in

529
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:58,139
the security people have to work
together there's no other choice you

530
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:02,809
must work on it together because we're
all seeing team the end right we're

531
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:06,670
really all just trying to make things
happen we need to sit around the table

532
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:11,060
understanding that everybody off the
table does something slightly different

533
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,130
well I should have put the graphic up
you know the graphic that everybody

534
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:18,470
talks about with the imposter syndrome
and it's got here's what you do well

535
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:21,400
circle in the middle and here's what
everybody else does well with a little

536
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,870
circles all the way around you and it
looks like you like surrounded by his

537
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,650
knowledge but really they're just two
circles themselves just like you are

538
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:33,720
that's the that in a nutshell is the
development and security divide

539
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,570
I know it sounds like I'm appreciating
platitudes but sometimes it's a

540
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:41,080
platitude because it's true you know it
really is

541
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,630
gotta remember the security is not
developers first or second or third

542
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,510
concern and it frankly it shouldn't we
shouldn't be in this position but we are

543
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:53,780
so we need to make sure the securities
are concerned and we're supporting them

544
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,960
they need to understand that we've got a
job to do and they need to work with us

545
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:04,540
when we get the time at the time will
have to give a little teeny bit I'm at

546
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,130
some point Twitter a lot of us get rid
of a blog post the clock at I wrote

547
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:16,510
earlier feel free to go to reread it
slipped my mind on twitter if you have

548
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,950
anything I'll take any questions anybody
has now

549
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:22,860
of the map and we'll see you all the
rest of the car and very much
