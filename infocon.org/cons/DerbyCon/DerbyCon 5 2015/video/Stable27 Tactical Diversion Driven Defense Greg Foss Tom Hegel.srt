1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,750
I'm good to go I cool things are going
through some I really appreciate it a

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,889
lot to cover so gonna get started as you
probably know you're at the tactical

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:18,470
diversion driven defense talk line so my
name is Thomas table and I work with

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,400
larger than labs in response to security
analytics engineer and we have great

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,359
here is great for us and the head of
security operations for longer than the

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:35,010
company also part of labs as a senior
researcher so today we're going to talk

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,710
about is essentially diversion and
deception and how this has been a very

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,300
successful tactic in warfare and how we
can come to take those same sort of

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,110
mindsets and techniques and apply them
to information security on someone you

10
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,829
know some of the key points really
touching on are essentially you know

11
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,940
drawing attention away from the main
point of attack and he just simple

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,789
diversion right and then misleading and
basically trying to trap attackers and

13
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,280
gain an advantage over the enemy when
they're already within our environment

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,970
essentially so traditionally diversion
and deception and warfare been used for

15
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:17,240
to skip been used for years very
successfully in multiple operations you

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,369
know throughout throughout all of our
history essentially so dive into one of

17
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,049
these in more detail

18
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:28,130
yeah a lot of these give really great
examples on the kind of tactics are

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,590
looking to transfer into that
postsecondary so first one is operation

20
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,119
mins mean if you're not familiar with it
basically it was a diversion tactic used

21
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:43,390
by the British against the germans where
they planted a corset the germans

22
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:50,680
thought was from a ship they sunk during
world war two and the course contained

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,149
tactics plans to attack briefs and
though the germans move all of their

24
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,439
defenses from sicily to Greece and then
the British attack sicily so really

25
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,830
basic example of kind of just using nice
diversion to inception to can alter

26
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,679
their plans of the

27
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:19,590
defense side so can we apply this to
enforce AK according to Mr code is of

28
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,920
course yes you can

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:28,359
so yeah so there's some basic rules that
you're gonna want to follow if you know

30
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:36,569
try to do this we ended up transferring
this from the warfare side past and

31
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:42,599
there are known to far the real so
basically there's a bunch of rules that

32
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,609
you want to follow a lot of the the
resources we say at the end can go in

33
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:52,519
this more details with you but basically
it all comes down to having a completely

34
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,510
quality focused defense plan and
basically you're gonna fall all these

35
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,790
things not gonna go into these two too
far but as long as you focus on quality

36
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,900
and being able to see and hear
everything that happens within your kind

37
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,489
of your defenses with the stat tactics
then you're good to go so happy to see

38
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,989
everything know what's going on feedback
at all angles is really important at

39
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,949
this point so going back to that in
practice we're going to talk about here

40
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:28,959
is how to translate this into the
InfoSec range with data network and then

41
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,000
also securing the human now we're gonna
focus on being able to translate these

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,549
tactics and said those three areas and
then we believe that once you master

43
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,849
those you can start to integrate that
within your offensive measures as well

44
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:48,129
which is our part we really liked so
first and foremost talk about network

45
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:54,120
defense rape so of course honey pots
come to mind because many parts are very

46
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,889
easy to deploy easy to configure
something that you can spread throughout

47
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,919
your environment to make look like
legitimate systems that you know are

48
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,099
expected to be there right now you have
to do is move legitimate services and

49
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,099
uptake services he can't wrap this
activity is something we do both

50
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,879
internally and with our customers and
it's been fun we've actually learned a

51
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,910
lot about the attackers that all of us
are facing just by watching them

52
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,630
in fake environments was not like really
that bad if they're getting in and

53
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,770
stealing stuff and whatnot so it's
really fun to just learn a lot about

54
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,790
attackers by using these yeah and great
actually it don't you saw the great to

55
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,030
talk yesterday on actually using honey
pots tons I use cases for these things

56
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,660
this is something that interests you
death in check out his actual for full

57
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,760
of talk on this topic alone but some of
these cases pretty much focus around

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,590
being able to slow down and track with
your taxes are doing while they're in

59
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,040
there there in the network

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,300
wasting their time is absolutely key
here once you start to apply this you

61
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,360
start to see that track and it's a huge
benefit for your defenses so first one

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,170
is that we want to talk about is just
simulating fake web applications and so

63
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,510
one of the most popular ones out there
is targeted all the time is PHP my admin

64
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,230
and so this is actually just a fake
phpMyAdmin application the nice thing

65
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,900
about this is you can do this with any
web application all you have to do is

66
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,170
essentially download the content
download whatever content they would be

67
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,490
able to see after they log in and
replace it with flat files and change

68
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,370
the the forum actions to just write
output log files also take like PHP code

69
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,580
snippets to read output as people visit
certain pages and stuff like that I'm

70
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,410
just a simple tactic to catch all sorts
of bad guys gonna poking around where

71
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,800
they shouldn't be the fun thing about
this is you can do this with any web

72
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,110
application I'm sorry here were
simulating a fake VPN service so healing

73
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:58,300
gas why would want to simulate a VPN
know it was in my talk with a so so the

74
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,080
main thing here you know not just like
gathering credentials and the user names

75
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,419
are seeing if like they're valid or
invalid password stuff like that but we

76
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,640
want to be able to run client-side code
on their system this is perfectly

77
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,630
expected if you log into the VPN service
rate his blog and then he granted with

78
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,919
Java applet year ago I need to run this
cause I wanna get two more things so I

79
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,870
mean this is a great way to trick people
into running client-side code on their

80
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,370
system unless they do this you can use
things like honey badger or you can

81
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,529
actually pop shells on the

82
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:30,949
them and stuff like that you know within
reason as long as you've laid the

83
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:36,579
groundwork to do that yes so if the
honey pot thing is something you're

84
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:40,319
interested in telling check out those
tacos and a lot more detail so that was

85
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,239
the network side of using diversion
defense now how do we translate that

86
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,869
into the data side so instead of
securing architecture network and access

87
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:51,939
into into the environment once they're
in how do we give them a diversion and

88
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,999
deception tactics against the stuff
they're actually after the data so it's

89
00:06:54,999 --> 00:07:02,629
great talk about the right to my
favorite aspects of honey tokens and and

90
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:07,609
that whole can of line of defensive
tactics is money tokens and document

91
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:11,309
bugging so-and-so show you how to create
these things are going through that

92
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:14,949
whole process I want to go through that
little simple scenario here so here's

93
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:20,949
our our shitty little network they found
on the internet and so we're gonna start

94
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:26,639
off with a bad guy rate is the bags as a
black hat and so he wants to get this

95
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,199
file from the share has shared his
laptop in this picture but whatever so

96
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,499
what he's gonna do is going to access
this file open it read it that this guy

97
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:39,819
has this file and you want to send it to
his body is over here it passed through

98
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:45,789
couple systems trying to make use of
this little graphic news baghdad to sell

99
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:52,049
the fortunately there is a security guy
and as soon as this file is accessed he

100
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:55,699
was alerted to the sensitive document
access because of file integrity

101
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,059
monitoring he's wondering why did the
spot was this file access this person

102
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:04,259
has no business accessing this file and
what's more since they've bug the files

103
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,739
as well as in addition to file integrity
monitoring they can track where this

104
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:11,729
file has been so you know like this guy
opened it and he's the system to view it

105
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,909
and now you can also tell that he sent
it over to his buddy way across you know

106
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:19,829
wherever this guy is and so that began
back as well so here you got a little

107
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:25,109
bit of data on where this possibly when
now it gets really fun when he decides

108
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:30,219
to send this outside of the company rate
too much larger entity a giant black at

109
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,310
this rate

110
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,700
well fortunately we have a really
awesome act advanced server outside to

111
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,860
which was alerted to this document
called back so it seems that happen we

112
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,330
can actually start to attack back that
sounds like the fun part is just where I

113
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,600
kinda got ridiculous but you get the
point of Lakewood 102 against our and

114
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,610
you had just gone right that's totally
happens in real life

115
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,670
yes this is like you get the point of
kinda the point behind document bugging

116
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:08,420
and and tokens and stuff like that you
know yeah so other types of data with

117
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,750
diversion is also the bombs if she
attended a stalking talk about those

118
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,040
little bit as well but the idea of
giving them something that they don't

119
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,950
expect this when you can actually
download that URL unforgettable idk its

120
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:28,460
42 bytes if I'll UN zip it and you get a
425 pedophile so it'll give your

121
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,520
attacker good time name it you know
confidential does it for something that

122
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,870
you'll have a good time with that kind
of its not your attacker so very fun

123
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,230
human defense rape has talked about
actually securing the human which is the

124
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,780
most important part I feel and some keys
to success with this are you know you

125
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,420
have to do real world testing against I
mean I just think little phishing

126
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,550
attacks are you misspelled stuff and
whatnot use real things that they're

127
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,070
gonna actually be hit with learn much
better the more realistic ete you

128
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,960
present them with with these kind of
scenarios or so and we like using a

129
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,860
blended approach TRX exercises we don't
just do you know phishing attacks and

130
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,180
stuff like that we do a lot more
in-depth attacks on and toms gonna go

131
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,480
through a lot of some of these tactics
that we employ within our organization

132
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,800
yes one big piece of that is never with
the stuff that we talked about here

133
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,320
never take that against your users and
embarrass or punish them based on what

134
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,650
you find through these the quickest way
to make this whole program hastily fail

135
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:35,400
from enterprise level and from an actual
enjoyment from your side but so these

136
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,510
couple examples will talk about really
focus on first examining your network

137
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,890
usage and then targeting these attacks
towards your users so this one for

138
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,540
example is coping your social

139
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,730
bits of user base basically all we do is
that we examine our traffic and see what

140
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:57,370
users and groups go to what sites such
as LinkedIn Twitter Instagram and in

141
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,740
this case scoping social habits excuse
me we see what type of public

142
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,940
information and we can get on them and
then we do sort of any sort of like

143
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,569
intelligence based around what we find
on them such as username correlation and

144
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,089
so forth and try to connect with them
and see how easy it is for them to

145
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,880
connect somebody they don't truly know
even if we are claiming something else

146
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,209
and then see what private information
you get from kind of the whole process

147
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:28,250
now if you there is a few things I think
a few weeks ago where a technical

148
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,149
recruiter was mapping out the InfoSec
industry on LinkedIn

149
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,370
great example of that basically seeing
what else is out there but it's taking

150
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,430
it outside the scope and going you know
industry-wide but fun very fun example

151
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,699
one free coupons

152
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:48,860
this is essentially the idea of using
malicious QR codes and putting them on

153
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,230
things for users to scan we like coupons
because we can just mass-producing and

154
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,339
said oh no said on every car in the
parking lot or animal print out stickers

155
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:01,290
the QR code or you know Derby Conn
tickets even the people see what they

156
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:08,190
scan but basically you can go to send
them to a training site that says you

157
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,680
been fished or things like that or you
want to take it a step further give them

158
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,120
the landing page and has demanded their
credentials for you know free subway

159
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,180
from Jared and then something like that
basically to start track here

160
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,769
user base and who's vulnerable to that
type of attack and then another one

161
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:30,110
spear fishing spear phishing could be a
whole talk on its own as it is Mark boss

162
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,260
and Eric milem actually did talk from
skype.com 2012 definitely YouTube that

163
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,399
if you're interested in doing this they
go into a fantastic detail on how to

164
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,189
execute this really well but we will we
like to do is take that network traffic

165
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,540
that we analyzed and focus our spear
phishing attacks against the users based

166
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,779
on what they expect us to see based on
what their usages of the internet and

167
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,110
you can get all sorts of cool
information from an obviously

168
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,010
what type of users open emails open
attachments and just like the QR code if

169
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,029
they go to a landing page you can have
them in her credentials things like that

170
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,610
and see what they are entering insights
that the truly don't know that the trust

171
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,540
no one

172
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,880
Road wi-fi access points basically the
idea of setting up an access point or

173
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,730
surrounding your user base this is
nothing new groundbreaking you guys

174
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:26,510
being a derby on all but giving them a
fake IDs saying who it is and who say so

175
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,100
far as our example here longer than wifi
we set it up at the sales conference for

176
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,380
our entire sales team came in and saw
how many of those guys were entering

177
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,430
their their domain credentials on this
landing page just like hotel wifi

178
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,310
pretending it thinking it was Lauren's
wi-fi network at this hotel fantastic

179
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,269
way to get everyone aware of this type
of attack first of all blog

180
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:51,700
non-technical people now know this is
completely possible and extremely easy

181
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,500
to execute but we got lots of metrics
around what users what types of users

182
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,449
enter their credentials and after he saw
the credentials types of weak passwords

183
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:07,810
and so forth so definitely definitely
tactic of you know you're into that but

184
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,949
great actually did a whole talk on this
topic alone there are some links there

185
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:14,890
can be seen with on YouTube and
SlideShare let us know if you need them

186
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:22,079
but when a lot more detail in our talk
on just this topic so let us know so

187
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,610
that I mean you know that's like more of
an actual like offensive tactic like

188
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,949
standing up some pic wireless access
points he was gonna log and I mean who

189
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:36,339
doesn't like messing with salespeople
rate so that kind of branches into red

190
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:39,279
teaming and we're not talking about just
pen testing where you go scan the

191
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,829
network you know pops a boner billion
stuff like that

192
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:45,839
red teaming is you know more adversarial
like actually imitating a real adversary

193
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,510
kind of testing and there's not a lot of
companies that actually do this very

194
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,449
well over there are few out there that
do this and so I mean this is something

195
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:57,430
like once your your company's mature to
a certain point this is a good kind of

196
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,030
next step

197
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:05,520
yes so that pretty much sums up the the
defense side of using a version of

198
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,740
deception to increase your defense is
obviously but once you master those

199
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,710
that's when we started think you can
take them into the offensive side to

200
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,610
really kind of step up your game and you
know take the next step in terms of

201
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:22,030
increasing your posture as an
organization so it's going alright so we

202
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,260
talked about honey pots for defense

203
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,320
well it's like i'm for office right so
in all sorts of enterprise environments

204
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,880
as always systems out there like
scanning the networks we being for new

205
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,580
systems new you know new services on
systems stuff like that and oftentimes

206
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,720
you know if you're not using SSH keys
are things like that they're just

207
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,740
logging in directly to these systems so
you actually use honey pots for in an

208
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,040
offensive way during like a internal
penetration tests so one of my favorites

209
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,870
is Kip though the cool thing about
Campos you stand us up on like your

210
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,260
teams shared pen testing server when you
do like an internal assessment something

211
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,420
like that just leave it up overnight
just move the real port realizes age

212
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,940
four and then stand up a capo honey pot
and port 22 see what logs in and so this

213
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,330
is just a little script they put
together while ago

214
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,040
essentially all this does it just rips
out all the passwords I recently entered

215
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,330
into the gipper honey pot as you can see
here in this example is a real pain

216
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,940
tests I had a blank everything out but
it's funny cuz they actually had the

217
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,970
past let you know the current password
the current domain admin password and

218
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,950
the past 12 pastors from the previous
guess he could basically access

219
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,930
everything in the environment just by
sitting there in letting them ride into

220
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:40,240
you so really simple tactic but taking a
step further social engineering is like

221
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,160
you know this is like kind of the
foundation of security and an insult

222
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,340
flag offensive tactics essentially so
one of my favorite things to do is join

223
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:53,060
forums where developers ask for help and
stuff like that and then talk them into

224
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,830
giving you information here's a good
example where this person was coerced

225
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,040
into divulging their session token and
the funny thing about this hard to see

226
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,240
but this actually doesn't expire for an
entire year so if you're able to get

227
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,790
this like you can access this
application for a whole

228
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,200
here assuming that it doesn't change
when they log in again stuff like that

229
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,140
but taking a step further if you're
actually able to edit the HTML web pages

230
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,480
that are on these support sites you can
hide with commands like a sailor say you

231
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,760
want to give them something big to paste
into a text file or something that

232
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,450
command prompt run well you can make it
look like this but in reality it

233
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:32,370
actually has the real commands hidden
behind this is using CSS within the web

234
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:38,150
page is called lacey is not what you
copy is great so here's an example just

235
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,940
kind of highlight how this actually
works so over here however tacker here's

236
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,560
our victim and here's the HTML page
criticizing jsFiddle to kind of show the

237
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,270
HTML and the rendered content to rate
here is what they see so just as echo

238
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,700
this is test and then so they have their
listeners set up this one up a little

239
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,690
neck out listener and then so here
they're gonna copy just this tax rate so

240
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,710
looks like I can trust this they're
gonna pace today n nasty as they do we

241
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,930
get a show I mean it's a very
rudimentary example but is something you

242
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,330
could expand upon if you have this level
access in like a sport former something

243
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:24,180
like that so a lot of that stuff focuses
on how to actually get into the network

244
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,740
obviously an offensive side using those
tactics but once we're actually when

245
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,360
we've done this once were actually in
the network obviously there's a lot of

246
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,590
posts exploitation tricks follow using
the same tactics and a lot of the focus

247
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,960
is really just around being able to do
with the basic pen testing type

248
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,020
activities such as elevated privileges
getting those credentials and pivoting

249
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,970
moving through the network looking for
what you're actually after a couple

250
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:55,080
examples of that stuff as well so for
example is actually really cool on that

251
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,330
a fuzzy not released last year at Derby
Conn which I thought was just awesome so

252
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,800
what this is is like you enterprise
environments where you're running we

253
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,940
have a bunch of Max oftentimes in on
disabled as a sage and so you have a

254
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,750
valid enterprise accounts you can
usually SSH and other people's boxes

255
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,280
so it's like it's hilarious but you knew
all sorts of stuff other than like just

256
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,590
make their computer talk this is a
really cool trick so here's an example

257
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:26,210
of what this what this actually does
here so we're just gonna pretend rely

258
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,790
guests a chance box and we're just going
to run a quick Apple script pretty

259
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,590
pretty short and simple and then you see
the System Preferences pop up as soon as

260
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,150
they click that their prompted enter
their password as soon as they do is

261
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,470
just passed back to us in plain text

262
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,290
think it's a very easy way to ask
someone for their credentials now on

263
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,500
Windows flood trick you to access
systems and stuff like that but you can

264
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,580
do the same exact thing using power show
to actually attack if you're in here

265
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,160
like a couple talks ago actually showed
this showed my crappy little PowerShell

266
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,130
scripts but yes this is exactly what
what it does we're gonna say we have a

267
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,170
mature procession on this host already
I'll say it's like a bastion host we

268
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,310
want to migrate to other people's
explore processes or something like that

269
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,460
well we can just run this we're going to
use the post exploitation XQ PowerShell

270
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,820
module within a display here we're just
gonna run my crappy little script and as

271
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,670
soon as it runs they get a larry Baer
said that was funny but and then so they

272
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,520
click on that and then there's prompted
for their credentials and so they log in

273
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,910
and then as soon as the description is
executing it writes the output to this

274
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,940
file and so we have to do is read this
file and then we get their plain text

275
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,070
credentials right there I mean same sort
of thing just doing it in different ways

276
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,470
for different system so as long as that
is fine asking people for their password

277
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,470
so another idea once you're in is
actually taking security tools there's a

278
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,640
ton examples we're not talking about
like popping code is on

279
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,060
you know the Kaspersky or something like
that keeping it really basic instinct of

280
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,370
from simpson company really really like
to play around the idea of feeding your

281
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,450
sim face backlogs and seeing what you
can change on the same way you can tell

282
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,660
it start modifying their in such or
anything

283
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,920
there's tons of examples here that you
can see but you know spoofing your

284
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,980
maps can and then against creeping
credentials from security tools at our

285
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,820
place came the network doing really
scans or anything like that and we later

286
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,560
essentially where you feel like a hat in
this case their live show an example

287
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,930
here in a second but the idea of putting
legitimate programs all over shares at

288
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,050
IIT uses but first modifying those so we
can get access and start playing with a

289
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,240
really cool idea there are endless
examples here but these are some of the

290
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,390
ones that we've come up recently

291
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:55,740
really like to play around with so for
example in here ever play with shelter

292
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,010
is a really cool program you can ramble
Linux and Windows essentially right here

293
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,500
with this program does is it back doors
other programs so you can have you know

294
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,810
I'm better on your own code essentially
it's a PBX injection tool and the best

295
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,950
part is a navy doesn't pick this tool up
let alone the binaries the you back door

296
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:22,720
with it so I was funny so here we have a
quick little example of what shelter

297
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,840
does so first orgasm and we're just
gonna show like oh it's successfully

298
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,580
back toward the smile and so over here
all we did was his body was decided back

299
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,510
there are plenty of his example and then
you can see as soon as we run it have a

300
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,740
session find out so just his troubles
accession out it still works which is

301
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,890
really cool and then you just sit back
and wait for sessions is upload these to

302
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,300
share something some trusted Playaz get
other people to install it is a very

303
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,490
simple way to gain access to other
systems of my favorite by far is just

304
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,480
targeting I T people just tricking them
into logging into your system or the

305
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,420
system of compromise you can do that by
disabling services or something like

306
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:03,990
that

307
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,160
just enough so that you know I someone
from ITT will have to log into your box

308
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,220
and the nice thing there once they live
in your box indices many cats and dumped

309
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,630
her credentials from memory

310
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:19,160
age old trick but it works really good
so it's just a fun tactic to you know

311
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,309
trick people into extensively exposing
their credentials

312
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:29,960
yes we had to burn through a lot this
really fast due to the time limit but

313
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,179
have something in this kind of interest
to you once you go and let us know we

314
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:39,269
could talk more about it more detail but
basically that hopefully that you guys

315
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:44,490
kind of grass can again from the stock
is being used these tactics on the three

316
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,600
different groups that we think are
important within defense and then taking

317
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,090
that towards the offensive side it was
works fantastic for us and a lot of fun

318
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,820
for both you and your users would
definitely recommend trying to pursue

319
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,700
this something that interests you some
resources if this is also interested top

320
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,029
one big shout-out depository and John
strand for their their work done in that

321
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:07,820
book of them to counter measures it's
fantastic resources to sit to same type

322
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:14,139
of tactics double check out that
something other than that about I'm so

323
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:17,509
think so much if you have any questions
feel free to grab the south side or hit

324
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:21,169
us up on Twitter or site or anything
like that and we're more than happy to

325
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:21,940
help you out

326
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,379
thank you so much
