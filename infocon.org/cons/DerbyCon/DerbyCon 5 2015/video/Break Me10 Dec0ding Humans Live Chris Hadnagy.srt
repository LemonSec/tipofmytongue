1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
shut down there some appear ok we're
really not talking about the many fish

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,360
large portions of Dave really not that's
not the theme of the of the talk today

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:23,289
although I do love to pick on dave says
he loves to pick on me but more chairs

4
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:28,930
if you want if not we're just gonna
start and then if you wanna stay until

5
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,610
more than welcome to if you don't want
to stand you come up here you know you

6
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,140
know what hit me was the greatest prank
level is making you believe is gonna be

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,200
a prank and then there's known as you
spend your whole time watching your back

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,370
I say that something that's going to
happen

9
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:59,420
ok so many of you that know some of my
work and what I do is a big believer in

10
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,920
understanding how to read the emotional
content that people don't want you to

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,629
see

12
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:12,180
helps us and communications of all types
but specially as a social engineer so if

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,530
you can read people's emotions and you
understand what it is that they're not

14
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,540
saying it can help you to reply better
and can help you to influence more and

15
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,729
can help you understand the emotional
state of the person that you're dealing

16
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:30,740
with aka your target doesn't just
applicable to security is applicable to

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,909
any time you're going to communicate
with a person at all so this information

18
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,180
is very good for all of that but we're
going to apply it directly choose

19
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,229
security and couple years I've been
given speeches on the amygdala and other

20
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,270
things here at Derby and then this year
unlike you know one thing we've never

21
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,829
talked about his practical application
of how do we do this live how do we need

22
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:54,640
to code the facial expressions that we
see in the what do you do about it

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,820
so this is like a real interactive
speech I'm going to ask you guys for

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,570
help throughout and talking about
different topics here so the first thing

25
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:09,100
we need to understand me just ask you
take a poll do you think it's important

26
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,990
as security experts to understand the
emotions that people reveal to you think

27
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,280
so yeah ok so I feel the same way as I
was just saying and that is what led me

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,260
to work with people like doctor
recommend and and trying to use his

29
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,810
tools in this industry and trying to
help people understand why this is so

30
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,209
important just like all of us here I
spend way too much time behind a

31
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,020
computer screen not interacting with
humans have been trained to speak in a

32
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,959
hundred and forty characters or less and
that does not help us be good

33
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,140
communicators and actually reverses that
whole thing I don't know how many of you

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,400
have young children still in school here
can I do to I don't know this is just my

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,200
daughter's school or tell me if this is
they stopped teaching cursive

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,709
handwriting in school I couldn't believe
it I couldn't believe it

37
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,340
my daughter came home said norm workers
of him running as I guess what I don't

38
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,860
care you learn to their home you gonna
learn it because I love you hire someone

39
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:16,380
in my company who can't write can write
your right leg dead chicken chickens but

40
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,750
that ran across paper that's what your
handwriting looks like I can't write

41
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,739
reports a chance send something to a
client that's handwritten and no one can

42
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,880
understand it's just hard to think about
that we can't do that and along with

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,690
those kinds of things we stop custom
technology and I'm not anti technology

44
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,930
obviously but because of technology we
stopped teaching kids that interaction

45
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,019
piece that's so important how to
interact with other people see their

46
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,380
emotions and react appropriately so this
is a really important piece so the

47
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,040
question then play since we all agree
that most of us here in this room answer

48
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,110
and agree that this is important that
what role does a major emotions play in

49
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,030
the coding humans well in this is a
fascinating part in the market to go

50
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,150
into great detail but this was a couple
years and if you want you can of course

51
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,569
see those beaches coastal own his

52
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,999
his websites you can see them there and
then YouTube but the way our our brains

53
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:18,130
process emotions through the amygdala is
all of their external stimuli like

54
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,599
oliver senses of smell or taste
everything that we have as our external

55
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:28,599
modalities come into our brain through
those century organist and they hit the

56
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:32,639
amygdala first tiny little walnut sized
piece of gray matter in the middle of

57
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,949
the brain that processes all that
stimuli and tell us what parts of your

58
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:43,169
body to interact so kind of a silly
example you see someone that you find

59
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,340
physically attractive what happens

60
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,120
well your heart rate goes up in a sweat
a little bit right there may be other

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,389
physiological changes people talk about
here

62
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,630
kids in the room but these things happen
will happen why does it happen is

63
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,810
because your brain process that external
stimuli and physiologically changed your

64
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,820
body and the response to it

65
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,919
well before all of that happens as
physiological changes you display

66
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:17,909
emotion on your face so you display
emotions on your face and those emotions

67
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,909
can tell someone who's interacting with
you how you feel and what kind of things

68
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:28,300
that they should be saying or doing to
you are with you in order to either feed

69
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,780
that emotion or even a motion to
understanding this to decode humans is

70
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,870
very very important so here's some other
facts to keep in mind so all emotions as

71
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,759
I really said process through the
amygdala the end this is a fascinating

72
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,349
piece of the processing of the amygdala
is one hundred to two hundred and eighty

73
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:54,090
milliseconds faster than our brain and
this is a big thing about this

74
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,830
millisecond so it's not like a long
period of time but I'm drain time that's

75
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,169
like ours because that means that your
amygdala has processed the external

76
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:09,330
stimuli before your visual cortices or
auditory all kick in and say hey I just

77
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,159
need to react this way and it triggers
emotional responses example of an email

78
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:17,409
that you totally enraged you

79
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,419
your typed out of really bad response
click Send and five minutes later you go

80
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:27,429
oh no never have that experience that's
what happened you got a motion jacked

81
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:34,449
and it shut down our logic centers so
when the emotional centers kick in logic

82
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,479
Center stop working so very important to
understand that and based on these

83
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,709
triggers we have physiological and
psychological responses so we know all

84
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:49,379
of this we can reverse engineering human
now we can understand their emotional

85
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:54,479
content that helps us to influence too
much better being able to read emotions

86
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,159
will change the way you interact with
people so there's a huge big caveat red

87
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:03,849
flag always tell everybody that we
talked about this just because you can

88
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:10,449
see the what doesn't mean you know the
why it doesn't make sense to you let me

89
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,209
explain this I'm a look at the audience
and then use this young lady here she is

90
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:19,779
not looking angry but let's say she did
I may see anger on her face

91
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:27,800
excellent now I see it is that she got
pissed as I called we see the anger and

92
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,459
that would have been wrong to assume
she's angry just like me and you start

93
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:38,159
to assume that the emotions about me how
do I make a connection between emotion

94
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:45,100
and the reason why

95
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,290
questions and having a conversation then
you understand why the emotional content

96
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:55,010
is there but if you don't do that you
can assume I don't know why she's angry

97
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,540
it could be anything she's tough dirt oh
she's got a text message from someone

98
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,990
with bad news she saw someone else like
a million reasons of why she's

99
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,860
displaying that emotion and it's not
always about me when you learn how to

100
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,390
read people's emotions the biggest
mistake we all make as we think we're

101
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,550
like neo and we can dodge bullets and we
can read everything we can see people we

102
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,600
know exactly what you're feeling a mind
reader not the case that means all on

103
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,690
have the ability to do at this point to
see what emotion

104
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,570
expressing at this point time to make
the connection to why I need to ask a

105
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,200
lot of questions and interact with you
more

106
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,280
really important point here is an
example just the first of all we know

107
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,070
this from doctor recommends work we have
seven base emotions may 27 emotions have

108
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,060
multiple different variations of
feelings so when I say emotion and

109
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,310
feelings are two different things and
emotion is actually like a script in our

110
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:59,710
brain that runs based on previous
experiences so what emotion like if you

111
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,080
were raised in a family that wasn't too
great and they got treated bad as a kid

112
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,040
right let's say your parents always
called you stupid and now you're in a

113
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:15,810
grocery store and you hear in the aisle
next to you so how does that make you

114
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,310
what emotions that raising you well
depending on your previous life

115
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,130
experience a script and maybe it will
make you feel very sad maybe it will

116
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:30,360
make you feel angry maybe you'll feel
afraid although those are emotions they

117
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,130
result in After Effects of emotion is
the feeling so now what you feel after

118
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,430
that could be variations of like being
petrified or being enraged those things

119
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,250
are different varying feelings that
result from the emotions so what we're

120
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,920
looking for is to understand the emotion

121
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,930
what it is that you're telling me three
your face and your body language that

122
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,310
you really aren't telling me you didn't
say it with work which I can read that

123
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,730
really helped me to learn how to
influence you let's look at a few

124
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,399
examples as the first answer these
questions for me a surprise positive or

125
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,079
negative raise your hand if you think
it's positive raise your hand if you

126
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:21,110
think it's negative interesting and 200
if you didn't vote and you suck ok thank

127
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,790
you for not helping so surprised is
interesting enough label but dr. Eggman

128
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,519
as a gateway emotion which means that
it's a gateway to other emotions and it

129
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,120
can be positive or negative example I'm
sorry that's why you don't raise your

130
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:51,570
hand if I had stickers and give you all
the sticker was good at that

131
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:58,410
hatred for myself so

132
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:05,519
no I wasn't surprised no wrong all the
time so if I walk into a room and a

133
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,379
bunch of you jump out and go surprise
and it's like an anniversary party like

134
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:14,310
that then it starts with surprise and
I'm happy afterward right and happy

135
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,269
because you surprised me but it's good
but if I walked in the room and you jump

136
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:23,480
out and you stabbed me in the liver I'm
surprised but I'm not really happy about

137
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:30,569
it afterwards like crap I can't drink
anymore so you know it's so surprised is

138
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,560
a gateway emotion to other emotions so
it can be positive and negative as a

139
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,050
corrected thank you that's not a good
surprise that's a bad surprise and I

140
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:59,639
will not be your friend like you know
what emotion should you display if you

141
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:11,180
see surprise on your target do you think
I'm sorry my own happiness is a good one

142
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,380
because if so whether surprised what we
don't want them to gateway to feature or

143
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,829
to anger so they're surprised maybe give
you a good example of this I once

144
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:25,600
approached us and when it was not a
engagement it was an older woman in a

145
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,949
parking lot you drop something and I
went to approach her and did it the

146
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:34,319
wrong way she was bending over in her
trunk putting her groceries and she's

147
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:39,220
like all five foot nothing like two
hundred years old and I was like man and

148
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,649
I tapped on the shoulder and she yelled
being mugged and these four guys

149
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:49,050
tomorrow night live in Pennsylvania
right now and people can hunt and kill

150
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,439
things for fun so so people like they do
go out at night if you hit a deer with

151
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:58,060
your car somebody will stop and go you
gonna keep it

152
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:09,940
want to keep it as a pet can I have it
what are you going to do it anyhow so

153
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,940
for guys referred us to mull it over in
understanding over this old woman with

154
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,030
money and she's yelling and being moment
she was surprised I was surprised to

155
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:26,280
fear and anger in check me in the liver
you dropped as I was getting it back ok

156
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,560
so what would have been great just to
approach it differently as you happiness

157
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,160
show happiness no real sincere smile
open body language and their says to her

158
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,650
a lot of threat so if you see surprising
your targets that's good because

159
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,330
especially depending on yourself and
your your vocal structure may be good to

160
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,980
take a step back and smile right now we
treat but take a little step back and

161
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:59,270
smile because you're in their face and
you see some surprise surprise

162
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:05,770
open wide mouth drops but created shape
of a no different than fear each

163
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:13,820
surprises ok and they'll be usually an
audible gasp if it's big surprise if not

164
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,710
you may not hear the gospel but you will
see the eyes even if the mouth is in

165
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:26,640
trouble and you always see the eyes open
wide

166
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:36,720
we have audio appear ok ok watching us

167
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:54,040
so you first see surprised and nose jobs
open he realizes he's standing next to

168
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,860
one of his idols and watch what happens

169
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,040
surprise surprise on his face

170
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,759
you really can argue it's epic ethics
now rarely in history will you see I

171
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:18,240
hope that level of surprise on your
targets if you do you have done so my

172
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,370
suggestion is the back way I will give
you a big fail story aware I did see

173
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:29,079
surprised that led directly to discussed
I so I began to building report I went

174
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:34,100
to this building and were trying to gain
access to and I was really nervous kinda

175
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,310
new to it at the time and I knew that
building rapport a few compliments

176
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,790
something on their desk but the front
and the gate the gate keeper of the

177
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:47,470
company and she had a picture of her two
daughters and her at a beach now one of

178
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,589
her daughters probably preteen in a
bikini and I said oh she sobered

179
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:57,730
beautiful yes that's the fishy made
right there

180
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:02,579
just a person needs to be in prison
while you're my complimenting her

181
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,269
preteen daughter I don't even know her
right eye was not the appropriate level

182
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:12,420
of response that kind of surprises when
I saw them when I forgot something in

183
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:22,019
the car just left you don't do nothing
so it was over so we see this level of

184
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:27,959
surprise of course happiness is the
great emotion to show in response to

185
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,670
that ok don't know what's happening
there

186
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,950
glad that was a safe video

187
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:51,310
surprise rule so right things

188
00:16:51,310 --> 00:17:03,910
watch the second surprise video this is
a great plan ok so this young man just

189
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:10,319
repeated against Usain Bolt and running
companies using bulldozers like the

190
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,550
fastest guys on the planet right and
he's being interviewed and what I want

191
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,780
you to watch for at one point Mr bolt
comes up and congratulate him for his

192
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:43,779
amazing what the no no no I have five

193
00:17:43,779 --> 00:18:22,460
no I have no voice and either cut was a
cup ice medical help

194
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:58,690
the ice

195
00:18:58,690 --> 00:21:19,440
it still

196
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:39,960
there was one time in Reno ok so just
watch first of all what we see on him

197
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,129
which is really cool as we see a lot of
happiness right

198
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:47,149
lot of happiness good smiles he is
really positive you can see it's like

199
00:21:47,149 --> 00:22:06,340
real there's no no put on here the first
time what did you think I just

200
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,259
competitive

201
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,570
nearly as

202
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:37,340
right after the extreme gateway to
emotion and then he can't even speak

203
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:50,020
like your idol walks up to you and says
well you did good man you know

204
00:22:50,020 --> 00:23:09,400
watch the fridge again

205
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:45,770
pretty great even from this even from
there and this one was a great example

206
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,430
of why we chose to use it

207
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,680
the melted not dropped to 10 shape as he
was speaking but you can definitely see

208
00:23:51,680 --> 00:24:07,280
that surprise in the eyes and it's
really cold to thank you john has really

209
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:15,230
great ok

210
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:22,520
answer these questions and there was
talk about fear is fear will do it the

211
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,590
real way

212
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:34,860
is very positive region is feared
negative in fear be both ok now let me

213
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:45,409
ask you a question and and as he
engagement is fear positive and this is

214
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,830
the key so you're hundred-percent

215
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:53,330
roller coaster and as you're going to
hear those clicks there's fear right and

216
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,919
as you're going down that first huge
there's fear but it doesn't end in

217
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,130
something bad

218
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,600
positive you know you're safe right and
when you hit that you get to the end

219
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,429
what you want to do I wanna I wanna read
that again again that's a positive here

220
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:16,049
but if you see fear in your targets and
this is a negative especially if it's on

221
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:23,140
your approach you approach and they show
fear other questions what action should

222
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:31,640
you take action to you take if you see
fear in your target do you think a step

223
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,899
back and something else that's a hundred
percent true you want to step back now I

224
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:39,240
saw someone do this we don't want to put
her hands out why not

225
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:49,220
yeah not the defensive when I basically
validates their fear what kind of thing

226
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:57,960
so what what is it can we do a major
strategies always good but that's not my

227
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,059
glad I want I want to continue with the
engagement so we we step back a little

228
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:10,480
bit and then we do what smile excellent
now here's the key with fear and it's

229
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,799
like to overdone what's gonna happen
that you look a little nuts to them

230
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,360
you walk up

231
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:27,260
right now so don't do that so you wanna
have a smile step back and something

232
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,970
else really important if you can make
yourself smaller without looking like

233
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:40,080
you're damaged so so like a pretty big I
don't wanna go like this but I generally

234
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,560
stand like this

235
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,670
generally stay like this especially if
I'm feeling pretty confident are good so

236
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:55,670
you don't want to stand like that would
you like to do is step back maybe what

237
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:03,230
this does is it says that a person I'm
not threatening not this big talking and

238
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:17,520
and I'm safe I'm good you do all that
which is actually really good question

239
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,240
so depending on the level of fear and
that is a really good point and where

240
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,380
you're at and someone showed real fear
and then you reached in your pocket

241
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,850
right as you get pulled over and you do
that you're probably getting taste you

242
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,720
know

243
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,890
or worse so you don't want that you
definitely don't want that so that's a

244
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,100
really good point but you want to figure
out ways so as you can tell not only do

245
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,570
I stand big gesture alot so for me to
control that I need to get my hands down

246
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,780
so I can lower my shoulders and this
creates a smaller version of me that's

247
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,830
not so threatening but you don't want to
do this do this because it's something

248
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:03,450
called general framing and this is it is
real thing and this is very territorial

249
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,520
and you're looking right there right now
why why is everyone doing it because

250
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,950
general

251
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,700
guys do it all the time when the
territorial but when you will never see

252
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,630
that again and you will see it now all
over the conference he was the people

253
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,080
doing it you'll be like I never knew
that was what I meant so don't do that

254
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,909
but you gotta find a way to get your
hands down another way to do it is if

255
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:27,140
you're steeple

256
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,809
that makes you seem less confident be
careful with low confidence posture

257
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:36,250
though because it's been proven and if
you want research on this there's a

258
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:42,390
social duty she did a TED talk about
this about how our body language

259
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,169
actually affects our emotional content
so you know they say like before you go

260
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:50,100
to give a speech you're going to
bathroom and stand like like this for

261
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,409
two minutes right you know put your arms

262
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:56,770
poses and it makes you feel confident
the reverse is true if you make yourself

263
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:04,710
seem small you reduce your for too long
a very quick interaction walk in here

264
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,450
backed up and continue with your
protection when the fear of aging

265
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,630
continue but a little less aggressive
I've done this many times I gotta

266
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:18,150
determine walk into a building and like
walking up to the gate keeper just a

267
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:25,260
little bit of this is back in a chair
and I just came in with hu hu fast back

268
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,820
when you're not in her face and also
people may not register what you're

269
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,630
doing but it makes them feel good that
you weren't in their space anymore and

270
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,670
it builds rapport

271
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,580
when you react appropriately to someone
else without calling it the worst thing

272
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:48,740
I can do is go back now I feel like
passing someone to do it because it's

273
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:55,110
embarrassing and when you called someone
it's embarrassing without permission or

274
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,580
without a good enough report based
relationship where it's appropriate to

275
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:06,750
call that emotion out here so far thank
you so what we're looking for the eyes

276
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:12,410
open wide much like a surprise so very
much like surprise the mouth opens but

277
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:21,180
instead of each this again very high
level we're not really looking at some

278
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,410
pictures you would see tensions in the
islands the neck and arms get tense

279
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:35,920
right back that happens and response for
freeze and then fight or flight from our

280
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:44,930
targets so we don't want to hear watch
this is an example of that elicits fear

281
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:59,570
in the other person she saw a pic of
play at all through and then remind him

282
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:08,660
policy you can see the emotion and
real-time 24 and it's likely one of

283
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:16,390
those international cities Knights

284
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:23,830
so she is back

285
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:43,010
creates a reaction him where he's like
that's the best i right

286
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:59,690
she's all power posing he's like yeah

287
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:08,970
that was not what I was like I just
built my own face hope you got that

288
00:32:08,970 --> 00:33:21,670
picture we should have that at the close
that was awesome

289
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:57,150
they're perfect fair perfect so and he
has not responded she freaks out he has

290
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:02,170
not yet respond so her and look at what
happened everything now

291
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:07,660
pullback in the each eyes wide open and
everything tensed up she's deciding

292
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:14,090
fight or flight and what was her choice
it was flight quickly reeled but watch

293
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:27,149
what happens to her fear

294
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:45,059
from recent news stories which was
really hard for this talk because we had

295
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:47,619
to find things that were like no more
than two or three weeks old so the

296
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,960
recent and it's difficult but this just
happens

297
00:34:50,960 --> 00:35:16,140
ok this is just awesome

298
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:33,490
ok anger anger positive one guy

299
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:52,510
calm down sir it's ok people voted

300
00:35:52,510 --> 00:36:03,660
can be both I'll be curious to talk to
someone I would I would actually like to

301
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,510
understand your viewpoints on that if
you can say it quickly please

302
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:20,800
but but the psychological aspects of
anger or not positive in the sense that

303
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,020
what happens when we're angry is both
physiologically and psychologically to

304
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:44,500
negative its negative on our body and
our mind me saying okay so I get i get i

305
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:50,810
get that part then it can be motivating
but anger is also one of the emotions

306
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,330
that shut down our logic centers quickly
which means that the decisions we make

307
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:00,510
are the motivations we have during an
angry time are generally less

308
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:06,800
intelligent than they would be one large
centres are there people often do things

309
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,640
like road rage or you know something
that leads to really bad results when

310
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:24,640
they're angry generally people are happy

311
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:33,010
but the baseline emotion would not be
angry at that you would you would feel

312
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:38,559
probably sadness and empathy and that
would motivate you to jump in to save a

313
00:37:38,559 --> 00:38:02,200
person's yeah okay so angry

314
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,559
their logic senator shut down you are
more likely to get information here's a

315
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,970
problem with that as a professional
social engineer I want you all here

316
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,710
companies to hire me know what you think
keep hiring the year after year and I

317
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,660
want to keep doing services with you if
I make you mad that is less likely to

318
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,349
happen

319
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:25,839
greatly less likely to happen and I can
give you an example of that we've got

320
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:34,190
some time I once did a job where we were
failing left and right again early on in

321
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:41,740
my career and made some bad decisions in
the world and we were just hailing and I

322
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,450
really didn't wanna feel the back then
and you may have heard Jason Street in

323
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,730
myself talk about this topic before
where we had to change the mentality of

324
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,509
the security people about its not about
winning for me about winning for the

325
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:57,819
client and sometimes that means I fail
as a security expert I don't need to

326
00:38:57,819 --> 00:39:02,740
have a hundred percent but I did then so
we we set up a scenario where they had

327
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:10,650
an open campus lunch area outside and
anyone can walk but we could not get in

328
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:17,240
the building and at every point I'm so
we went to the lunch area and had a

329
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,500
female person who acted like a co-worker
act like a manager and we waited for a

330
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,730
group of guys who was sitting at a table
and i was standing there and she had

331
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,190
walked up to the pretext was gonna get
some surveys filled out

332
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,530
and the service had a bunch of
identifying information that we would

333
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:38,069
use for fishing and fishing later on in
the project she walked up and she said

334
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:44,460
no these surveys help and I flip out on
her you worthless

335
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,760
this is why you can't keep a job you
know if you can't do it right I'll find

336
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,810
someone that can and I walk away she's
in town as well what's the natural

337
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,790
response from everyone around her

338
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:02,540
yeah now they come up how are you
talking and now she does the classic and

339
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,970
this was all planned it's terrible and I
hate admitting that we did this here's

340
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:13,410
what she did she start defending me
classic abused wife syndrome is not that

341
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,200
bad he just under a lot of stress you
know he just has a lot of probs gonna

342
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,140
home right now it's ok I shoulda got
this done and now everybody would you

343
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,640
want to do when you hear that you want
to help her and you want to come and

344
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,970
kick my butt but you want to help her
first so they did and we got like 25

345
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,349
people to fill out the survey right now
what do you think happened when I come

346
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:42,510
in for the report meeting jerk I wasn't
krishana you the great social engineer

347
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:47,829
that exploited a vulnerability I was the
jerk I never got higher than the company

348
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:53,960
again and leftover residual negative
emotions may have caused me to win but

349
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,530
it was a will cost me so it wasn't
positive change the structure of our

350
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,089
company literally we'd never used those
protections we always leaves a person

351
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:09,450
feeling better for having that and it
works great works way better and I have

352
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,980
classes have been with me for her five
six seven years year after year doing

353
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,440
the same work so that to me is a bitter
testimony that using anger but I'm not

354
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,950
really getting your arguments I think
their their their valuable

355
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,730
and there's truth to them and just
choosing the path I have two afterwards

356
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:31,710
let's talk again so we kind of already
mentioned this but what action should we

357
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:41,480
take if you see anger I'm sorry yeah
well maybe not right away

358
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,380
the first action you need to take is
definitely not become defensive so we

359
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:52,920
don't exactly empathy is great so we
really want to really make herself small

360
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,970
and we want to lower our voices because
then that eases people's anger and then

361
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:07,480
it's about their anger that you can say
something even like I'm really sorry and

362
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,430
that right away put people at ease

363
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:17,990
excellent suggestion he said slowing it
down so you take that step back maybe a

364
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:24,450
little apology I'm really upset and you
really you should keep your eye contact

365
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:30,640
don't stare them down nearly as creepy
creepy

366
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:46,350
runaway first she would ok ok let's talk
about that a good idea if you approach

367
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:53,690
me and I'm angry and you get angry what
is most likely going to happen if I know

368
00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:00,620
it's a horrible idea because because
because we have we have a group of

369
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:06,570
neurons and we mirror the emotions we
see around us proof of this you're

370
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:14,290
walking down the street here in
Louisville Louisville you walk past the

371
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:20,020
restaurant you cannot hear what people
are saying at one of the tables as a

372
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:28,570
group of people I wasn't doing as a
group as a group of people laughing and

373
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:34,910
you see them laughing and smiling what
do you do when you see the emotion you

374
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,800
back your brain

375
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,430
babies from their parents have messed up
negative parents the emotions grew up

376
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:52,280
with it's very hard to change that as
you grow up in life is to do it so it's

377
00:43:52,280 --> 00:44:12,140
very difficult for you to view mirror
group anger creates

378
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:18,830
it's not healthy right now group anger
is is why groups like the KKK why

379
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:23,200
terrorism any country works is because
you get together and your comment your

380
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,190
comment believes someone was smiling and
looking for common belief system is hate

381
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:35,650
and hate and anger feed negative emotion
group group mob mentality no deposit yet

382
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:47,960
another one in social engineering
definitely bring questions as what about

383
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,230
your body language during the engagement
so there's a couple different things you

384
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:56,320
have to do right away I contact needs to
be limited but you don't like it when

385
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,760
your dog knows you're angry what is your
dog do right and it may even rollover

386
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:11,820
don't do that don't like I'm not going
to scratch your belly ok but you can do

387
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,560
that psychologically right turning as a
defensive posture of people fight they

388
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,880
turn you don't want to do that right and
this is one where the gentleman over

389
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,420
here mentioned we're sticking how
quickly your pocket may be seen as a

390
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:38,460
defensive side lower ourselves and
voices a big they raise their voice and

391
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,800
now the level of anger can determine if
you need to apologize

392
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,250
if it's really low anger like I want to
walk to the office and I literally I

393
00:45:48,250 --> 00:46:07,670
didn't see one person turned and looked
really angry I don't need to go up ago

394
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:22,309
so so so the job gets tight the change
its lower in this is physiological

395
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:29,680
response why because protection
everything gets tight your fist your

396
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:45,770
eyes open wide but which creates a
wonderfully there don't do it if you do

397
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:51,940
it happens what I said about your body
language recent science scientific

398
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,420
studies have proven that the reverse is
true with their facial expressions

399
00:46:54,420 --> 00:47:00,670
making the facial expression will create
the emotion so it's a powerful thing if

400
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:31,210
you practiced as always and watch this
video is a fascinating

401
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:35,349
got a baby in the carriage and he's
already got some anger on his face as

402
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:40,640
you can see it there is clear that is
for you but you can see in the tightness

403
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,720
of the job on the brown but it really
would take a long time for someone to

404
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:52,200
recognize this level so here will be
more evidence coming up

405
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:59,380
holy crap right so this is escalating as
anger is escalating and this is now a

406
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:13,960
mixture of disgust and anger on his face
he is really pissed and that's why what

407
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:27,320
happens next is what happens and Aston
Martin $300,000 car and keys it didn't

408
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,280
do that well this particular
neighborhood people are known for hating

409
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,470
people have money he's gonna polished as
intelligently put a camera in his car

410
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:40,940
with emotions he gets near starts
filming this guy got arrested and fined

411
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,869
he's gotta pay for the damage you know
really ridiculous what he did but

412
00:48:45,869 --> 00:49:07,150
amazing

413
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:25,829
ya back

414
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:32,329
people's face so again think about this
scenario you see that guy and you take

415
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:37,479
your idea you approached him with anger
what is going he has already made a

416
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:43,670
decision in his mind to do something bad
now you approached him with anger that

417
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:49,950
bad things going to happen to you and it
probably won't be a king so really

418
00:49:49,950 --> 00:50:00,849
cautious with mirroring anger during
engagements ok let's watch a video with

419
00:50:00,849 --> 00:50:08,369
a blend of emotions so what do you think
seen motions of a person can tell you

420
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:14,549
about their feelings towards another
person so let's say there was two of us

421
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:20,119
up here speaking David IRA speaking
together and every time they've talked I

422
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:27,309
showed contempt what would that tell you
about my feelings toward Dave and

423
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:30,299
negatively don't like him

424
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:38,709
the truth I really do like to but I
would you would be able to say and that

425
00:50:38,709 --> 00:50:41,839
would be like giving me the questions
was it would be evident that every time

426
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,609
I was interacting with him so watching
sometimes the people who are not

427
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:50,819
speaking can tell us about their
emotions towards the speaker really

428
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:59,150
positive but what should we never assume
at first until we get more clarification

429
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:07,019
the Y occasion never assume the Y like
the contempt if you saw it for dave was

430
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:09,429
because I hate him and I want him dead

431
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:14,119
that would be horrible to assume that
when the reality maybe I'm just sick of

432
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:20,809
drinking Smirnoff Ice so now I like
Pavlov's dog and when I see smirnoffs I

433
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:27,979
think of dave and it really is a bad
thing I see when I get angry occasional

434
00:51:27,979 --> 00:51:32,630
in this case scenario we're not looking
for any particular emotion were looking

435
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,769
for signs of comfort or discomfort and
then we're looking for a congruent

436
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:41,529
emotional displays and what that means
is the conversation is happy but there's

437
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:44,729
one person who's angry or the
conversation is angry and there's one

438
00:51:44,729 --> 00:52:03,710
person who's happy we're looking for
those and here's a great video on this

439
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:33,960
really slip of the history of Rangers
corn Jones quickly what we see on her

440
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:43,020
left hand he looks happy right and what
about the guy on her right he doesn't

441
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,770
look happy

442
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:52,800
ok that's what we see right now no
assumptions ninety-plus of her tomorrow

443
00:52:52,800 --> 00:53:09,400
hope they come back strong mind to do
tomorrow I just came here to try to be a

444
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,320
better is a good question do you see a
motion on either of the guys next to her

445
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:27,410
many people say yes how many people
saying no I don't

446
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:34,789
see any emotion I don't I see no telling
emotion you make confuse this with anger

447
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:48,200
but there's no tightness in the job is
no breath for a bro bro thanks yeah he

448
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:57,319
may but there's no facial expression of
emotion at this point that other women

449
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:09,380
who have that same goal in mind just
there the reasons why I chose to come

450
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:18,849
with the same as he's not here to get
the experience even though they're not

451
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:31,819
totally and focus the guy on her right
tell me what you would see doesn't mean

452
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:38,819
anger you know when I see here I see
sadness when I seen in his eyes as his

453
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:46,730
brows and furrowed is no tightness in
his job and his body language that's

454
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:55,849
what I see me the opportunity to leave
my soldiers considering quitting

455
00:54:55,849 --> 00:55:07,319
throughout the course I think I didn't
appoint now you see a conversational

456
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:12,520
signal when she talked about that the
guy to her left started to agree with

457
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,200
her

458
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,170
the guide her right made absolutely no
indications whatsoever

459
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:24,670
nothing whatsoever you hit the way it
doesn't matter where it is different for

460
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:29,920
everybody else but you gotta give me
more time Dave came in here and molested

461
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:49,460
me thirty times I thought I had 10 more
minutes they were second just as bad as

462
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:58,930
I was kept me going and I'm pretty sure
now we're going to find out what the

463
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:12,310
commotion was about was the first thing
he said was pretty skeptical so this is

464
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:21,760
what we're seeing he was skeptical but
why the sadness why did not find out why

465
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:32,580
was this is his third time and Rangers
cool she passed first time that's pretty

466
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:38,750
telling some jealousy maybe some shame
feeling bad about himself and these are

467
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:48,020
negative just feel bad maybe now we'll
see what happens and this will be very

468
00:56:48,020 --> 00:57:07,680
telling Joe and I was in there is 13 $20
at a lot of weight on the starting point

469
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:25,519
takes in this way

470
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:28,890
so from that from that point

471
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:36,799
ok majorly just happened and then we'll
have to unfortunately and shortly after

472
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:42,189
so firstly telling the story the only
person to save him was the person he was

473
00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:48,469
skeptical that would even make it so the
sadness matches now matches it doesn't

474
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:52,969
match the situation but imagine what's
going on up here as he told us the

475
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:59,269
second he says I'm no longer skeptical
but he did something again a very short

476
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:03,890
pieces I need you to see it anytime we
don't believe the words were saying we

477
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:09,729
do a single a single shoulder shrug and
he does a really single small single

478
00:58:09,729 --> 00:58:30,039
shoulder shrug when he's no longer
skeptical ok watch this crap little

479
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:35,169
stuff but that was amazing to me that
was amazing to me cause I saw that it's

480
00:58:35,169 --> 00:58:40,929
like he's he's not he doesn't hate her
her he's mad at himself he failed three

481
00:58:40,929 --> 00:58:43,130
times than any of his head

482
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:49,689
she's a woman and she comes in and she's
the only one to take the sack off him

483
00:58:49,689 --> 00:58:54,969
and to run it when every other guy was
like I can't do it and now he has to say

484
00:58:54,969 --> 00:59:02,459
whenever ok love to play the rest but I
think they said Nick up here and I had

485
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:05,600
some great slides want to see what
you're about to miss

486
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:12,940
God

487
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:25,210
yeah there was a blessing for more time
how many of you would like to repeal

488
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:47,550
against Derby kinda let me go more ok
I'm ending my proudest ok ok so if you

489
