1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,640
and sweet about him but we rollin also
welcome everybody rooms online and we

2
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,219
actually have video so my name's Amanda
some of you know me a lot of you

3
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:45,629
probably don't invest online I currently
work at her him labs doing network

4
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:53,050
security in northern Ohio and this this
talk is based on our dental health care

5
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:59,079
facility for seven years and we
implemented a training program that was

6
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:08,210
all I fishing and so this is what that's
about some of the stuff I did as a

7
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,010
Windows admin for a long long time

8
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:16,409
Active Directory power still a kind of
stuff to program a lot of purple teaming

9
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,640
within within healthcare i guess i know
i do network security a lot of stuff

10
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:33,729
with checkpoints and Cisco like that so
just a random assortment of stuff that I

11
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:41,890
used to work around 2,000 employees the
majority of them are nurses so a good

12
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:49,290
amount of a female populist we are ready
by the time we got to want to implement

13
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,110
efficient program we had already kind of
hard and a lot of our security

14
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,250
notoriously Healthcare's whore

15
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,820
durable and it comes to anything
security-related some amazing horror

16
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:08,530
stories about that stuff and we already
had some sea level by in our our our CEO

17
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,570
used to be a C so for another health
care organization when he came and so he

18
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,590
knew the value of security anyways and
he kind of knew what we were talking

19
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,300
about he wasn't clueless and they gave
us $1000 budget because they wanted to

20
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,480
see what we could do with a thousand
bucks and my time to see how better our

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,380
user education was as we really only did
some CBT is to check off the box and

22
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:44,140
didn't actually teach them anything i
mean CDs are pretty much worthless but

23
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,580
you have to do them a lot of people do
it just for compliance so I wanted to

24
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:58,440
start out with a baseline to kind of
tell me where where our users weaknesses

25
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,910
we're just to see kind of where the
program would take us so this was my

26
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,310
first fish ever like I'd never fished
anything before we wanted the idea was

27
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,980
to start a super basic as possible
because we were hoping that we weren't

28
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,480
wouldn't get we're actually capturing
credentials are hoping we wouldn't have

29
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:28,310
any credentials I actually chalk this
one up because I was using social

30
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,910
engineering toolkit and it is the first
time I had done a ton that large vote of

31
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,340
a scale and I had tested it out myself a
little bit just to see if it would work

32
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,720
and I completely crashed my Cali box in
the middle of the fish it's the first

33
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,489
link I sent out was broken so I said
fuck it I just resent another one saying

34
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,950
sorry but it's from a gmail address that
I just randomly created plain text and a

35
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:00,540
link that went to an IP address that was
just a scrape of Survey Monkey site

36
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:12,140
gathered the information just like
somebody normally would do harbor

37
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,950
certified as a pretty cool python script
that will go out and screenplay Google

38
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,690
LinkedIn Facebook that kinda stuff for
your domains email addresses that I can

39
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,330
find out there on the internet so I
found fifty of them and I still got 16

40
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:35,199
user names passwords that 30% so not
very good and only four reports and

41
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,550
other Active Directory credentials you
know absolutely nothing would have

42
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:47,840
pointed out that it should be something
that was legit I mean the only thing I

43
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:56,120
put in there was the company name you
know in the fake email address so this

44
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:03,370
is my second one still hadn't had a
program at this clean they were just

45
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:11,010
saying sure you just sent us some fishes
not having a program with troubled you

46
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,229
probably should beginning we did it was
a lot of growing pains going through

47
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:23,169
these different fishes the first one i
dead in july this one was in August of

48
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:30,639
that year after this fish it took
another six months for us to build the

49
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,380
program before I can start fishing
people again because we actually got a

50
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,659
lot a lot of usernames and passwords I
don't know can't remember this was the

51
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:58,199
one or not actually since the CEO by
senate like on a Monday you know after a

52
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,910
three-day weekend

53
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,290
he was just trying to get through shit
and I got a new password after that

54
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,270
point is when they're like oh this is a
thing we probably should know how to

55
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:16,830
tell people about it so we wanted a
program with some teeth that really

56
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:23,860
creepy picture gets the point across

57
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,170
so we called it something smells fishy
we want to keep it around like a fish

58
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,680
type of team so this is some of the
material that we actually gave to the

59
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,040
user's

60
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:47,590
fishing was I'm a big proponent of using
the word hacker in a positive light so

61
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,250
we let them know that we actually had
internal hackers that we're going to be

62
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,740
helping them out and the whole idea was
for education they were going to get a

63
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,750
snack on hand a lot of a lot of places
like to do that like to point out you

64
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,630
know their failures and you let them for
clicking on stuff but we wanted to make

65
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:12,490
sure they they felt safe enough to talk
to us some stuff to took a drive home

66
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,180
the point

67
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:27,180
other things the ease of use for
reporting and and I'll get to some of

68
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,880
that as I can but we actually had to
come up with some contest rules we don't

69
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,090
realize this until after a couple months
because people are trying to game the

70
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,960
system after I found out about it we had
actually the whole point of the program

71
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,620
they would if they would be us or a real
fish they would get their name dropped

72
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,200
in a fishbowl that's wishful are you
would draw prizes like monthly quarterly

73
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,220
and yearly we're having people just like
forward spam like I got this fish I'm

74
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,990
going to forward this to somebody else
to send it now it's just so we actually

75
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,210
had to come up with some rules

76
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:23,979
so far Awards again we wanted to keep it
fish deemed as much as possible

77
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:28,460
actually had a coffee shop in the
hospital itself and a lot of people

78
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,010
would go there so every month to hunters
worked on for 10 bucks to the coffee

79
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:42,740
shop 50 bucks to Red Lobster Bass Pro
for quarterly winners and end of the

80
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:49,420
year so that was our entire budget is
$1000 for the prices we didn't spend any

81
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,529
money I created all the material

82
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,980
worked with my supervisor and our
director to kind of come up with the

83
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:04,160
program make sure everybody was on board
and these are the actual vicious

84
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,310
how I did it this is actually what they
would get if they give me their username

85
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,760
and password or click on a link open an
attachment

86
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,860
the end goal was always to get them that
shock factor of holy shit really

87
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,959
shouldn't have done what I just did and
let them know that it's fine and and

88
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:40,709
can't go over the material of what not
to do how we got ya

89
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:54,050
you been hacked with automated inset you
can set up that kind of stuff so after

90
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,720
the website scrape you can forward it to
another web site a lot of times it'll

91
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,720
just forward back to the real website so
just as like a refresh but you can

92
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,170
customize it so you can send it wherever
you want this was a whole host of

93
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,910
locally web server

94
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,200
that as soon as they take their username
and password so that's that's a really

95
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:23,250
nice feature so this was the most
difficult part about running this

96
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,680
program was keeping track of almost
2,000 employees and I talked to Chris

97
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,830
had no idea about this is actually to
plug in a little bit I think he's coming

98
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:38,180
up with a tool that would actually track
this kind of stuff I did it all in exile

99
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:44,450
absolutely terrible worst part of this
whole thing was keeping up with that as

100
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,310
you know we have a lot of turnover so
you're playing in people

101
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,440
email addresses from Active Directory
you're getting a report at the end of

102
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,030
who clicked or who gave their user
credentials and then we wanted to also

103
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:04,190
keep track for the reporting to see how
that metric went with how much training

104
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:12,080
reporting out so that that metric also
helped us when it came to the rewards

105
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,910
program so three columns every month of
two thousand users that was also very

106
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:26,010
and there was just a gigantic pain but
this was my first legitimate fish from

107
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:33,860
when the program started the idea was we
wanted to cover all of the users but not

108
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,450
all at once I don't want to send out two
thousand emails every month because I

109
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,750
just think that would not be fun so we
figured you know we'll split it up to

110
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,880
the people that use their email the most
first because they're going to be the

111
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,490
ones I probably click on the links

112
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,899
housekeeping staff and maintenance
wouldn't really ever use their email so

113
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:03,720
I went to Target like sea levels
physicians nurses that you know usually

114
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,540
means a lot to communicate our inner our
internal my team and I wanted to keep it

115
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:18,250
as basic as possible as obvious as
possible as it was a fish and and kind

116
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:26,600
of ramping up from there if you reported
it and you didn't get fished who had to

117
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,630
do that twice in a row and you were
taken off the list until you know like

118
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:36,730
next year because those people are
pretty security-conscious already I want

119
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,470
to focus on the people that are always
giving me their usernames and passwords

120
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:45,310
and if you did give me that are you did
click or you didn't report you

121
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,720
automatically got added to next month's
list so you would keep on getting it

122
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,910
over and over again

123
00:12:52,910 --> 00:13:00,959
blanket gmail address he said it you
know urgent this was right around the

124
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,600
first of the year so people think about
the texts I'm and it was just a log in

125
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,450
to think this is a long and RHR system

126
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:23,480
three hundred and that's a lot like from
me when I know what I just started doing

127
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,270
this was so cool because if you've ever
used to actually see in real time

128
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,800
usernames and passwords jump above the
screen I was sitting there like all

129
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,370
happy that actually getting you know
credentials I don't know people thought

130
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:45,240
it was weird that I validate the crown
jewels obviously not all 322 I would

131
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:54,610
spot checks on yeah and they were they
were great and then you know that also

132
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:01,440
with this we did like analysis on the
passwords right and they were like just

133
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:14,720
surprised I mean I'm gonna blast through
this stuff so we didn't february 14

134
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,630
Valentine's Day

135
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:23,220
89 usernames and passwords are reporting
was going up so that was good as nice to

136
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,050
see that many reports are harmed
middlemarch won this one didn't work out

137
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,220
so well so we're part of health care not
if you've ever heard of March of Dimes

138
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,140
like a fundraising thing

139
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,980
and we are actually leaving something
out so many March of Dimes emails I'm

140
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,620
pretty sure this just like people just
had automated rules are sending marc

141
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,440
Stein ship to the trash so I'm pretty
sure that's why this one didn't work out

142
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:56,990
well I would have deleted it to you
aren't or so only 430 437 reports which

143
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,520
was really nice

144
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,500
this was this was a great stepping stone
for us because we had never actually

145
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,830
done any real live reports ever before
so after after we actually started

146
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:18,540
teaching people to do then I call hey
maybe I should actually it was one of

147
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,620
our directors in this was actually
somebody that he was working with and

148
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,780
had contracts with but he wasn't
currently working with us personal

149
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,680
project so he thought it was a little
weird it was actually a click that link

150
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,290
that would capture credentials so it was
it was very nice we used headin kind of

151
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,440
as

152
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:48,340
what's the word yeah yeah thank you like
a poster boy for what to do right now we

153
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,700
made sure he was sent us out this one
was one of my favorites

154
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:02,310
it was a Kohls receipts for 600 bucks
for fine china sent to some dude in

155
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:13,180
South Africa kind of felt bad for this
lady she canceled her gold card and she

156
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:19,640
was not very happy she got like extra
hard to even have to mean anything like

157
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:26,990
10 bucks but still I felt a little bad
but it was kinda want to hurt you want

158
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:33,190
to look for reporting only on this one
so 23% was pretty good

159
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:41,010
was May and June actually sent out to
third parties contesting company that

160
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:47,330
would comment and sent us over here
they're professionals doing this fish

161
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:56,300
and he didn't get finished like we had
rational company come in and trying to

162
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,770
social engineering to Fisher employees
and alright so the bottom line for the

163
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,329
two emails toppling we didn't get fish
the bottom one depending on who you talk

164
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:09,850
to because it was after the period when
they were supposed to be testing us they

165
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:15,319
just left the website up to one person
technically did click but some people

166
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:22,620
say it didn't count but I think so the
plan of everything right is instant

167
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,680
response it's not their job to
understand what to do

168
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,340
what to do on their machine if they
clicked on something or gave up their

169
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,760
username and password the point is they
need to get it as fast as somebody who

170
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:43,640
knows what they're doing as possible
this was for the professional fish three

171
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,580
minutes

172
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,930
three-minute incident response time with
an 11 minutes we were already discussing

173
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:57,530
all running it and when removing it from
exchange in a country that's awesome

174
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,560
like sometimes people don't find out
about that shit until days later like

175
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,380
the other day I just gave them my
username and password not weird stuff

176
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,690
happening no like this is this is
exactly what you want you want people to

177
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,870
feel comfortable enough to know that
what the urgency and why they have to

178
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:19,830
contact you right away another one

179
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,240
capturing credentials now is just a
click that would take them automatically

180
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,890
to the site this one was cool we just an
Egyptian downs open across the street

181
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:37,020
everybody I think open this one it was
just an attachment of the training

182
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:47,590
material that was that was all it was
was a PDF of the training journal and

183
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:53,100
this was the last one because I was
leaving for another job so I just said

184
00:18:53,100 --> 00:19:00,740
fuck it and it was in the middle of when
I was leaving it was 17 reports as of

185
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:07,910
the time I lost really show off the last
time I had these graphs are really

186
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:13,230
shitty and you can see so I kinda wanted
to charge what happened to me because I

187
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:19,790
think about it it's all the metrics that
we talked I kind of thought about taking

188
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,650
more metrics based on

189
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,890
on gender age that kinda stuff just to
see like maybe what time it was sad to

190
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,610
say there's some talks based on when
people are more likely to click on the

191
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:40,400
links rate so like Monday mornings after
a weekend you know just trying to clean

192
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,670
up stuff but this this is what I could
to crack out so you know the facts the

193
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:58,810
reporting went up based on you know time
is good and the reported percentage and

194
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:07,710
fish percent went down that was
important 1 I'm so bidirectional

195
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,360
positive responses what you want you
don't you know I've talked to a couple

196
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,830
people that actually have programs in
the organization that they would have

197
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,750
liked a wall of shame of people that
clicked you know they would they would

198
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,870
get demerits you know that's not how
that's not how you want to handle you

199
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,260
want them to be a part of the team
that's it

200
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:34,710
that security is everybody's everybody's
responsibility they are very happy that

201
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,000
we are starting job and teach such as
opposed to being the dudes that sit in

202
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,340
the basement by their computers on our
cubes this was prob I i think one of the

203
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,750
most important things to get across to
the users is that you know it's it's a

204
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,900
fun thing it's a it's a contest there's
a buncha stuff out there about

205
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:01,380
gamification of this kind of stuff and
that's the reason why someone is always

206
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,310
an eclectic but that's not the important
part of the important parts in Sanaa

207
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:11,240
response no social engineers will always
get in it's our human nature but

208
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,690
definitely want to do is the important
part is exempt said you know we got we

209
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,850
got RIT director I got the CEO positions

210
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,680
these people these people are smart

211
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:29,480
but you know when it comes to this kind
of stuff it's not what they know the

212
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,820
point across I should have worked with
eight

213
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,210
marketing a little bit more than a lot
of people didn't really know about the

214
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,220
program at that point in time when I
found out I was leaving I was gonna try

215
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,020
and work with them create posters other
kind of material to get up there

216
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,010
communications always the hardest part
is getting everybody to actually know

217
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:58,760
about it this is a for a dream that I
didn't have enough naked man in my life

218
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,050
that's not a one size fits all I talked
to some of that worked in a very large

219
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:11,700
credit card company and the people you
know he said they wouldn't they won't

220
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,200
let us implement this because they
constantly of people protecting her not

221
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,670
to text perfer customer support that if
you fish and it takes away from their

222
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:30,430
time on the phone billing customers
they're they're losing money because

223
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:38,040
they have to always always be building
that was the reason behind not being

224
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,720
able to officials employees taking time
away from them to educate them wasn't

225
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,130
worth it to them which netscape mean
that if you're a large corporation you

226
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:58,590
want to take the risk and whatever
change so starting out I didn't really

227
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,400
try and help us come what to do when
someone calls when someone forwarded an

228
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,240
email that was a big mistake because
right away we had like a breakdown in

229
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,330
communication where sometimes you know
one person would tell them

230
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,409
just for the email the other personal
just deleted or they wouldn't know it

231
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:23,769
was a live fish going on that was nice
day before my species I think we did

232
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:30,149
that after the first time or on a
machine cuz the spreadsheets and I wanna

233
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:38,760
dance and dishing so on my blog all that
shit up there I had a couple people just

234
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,149
pull down and use it I took all of all
of our company information off of its

235
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:46,539
you can just add your own logos and
stuff

236
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:58,010
a bunch of links Ben 10 has a really
good game of Cashin blog on his target

237
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:05,159
sucks up there and fishing frenzies
actually a good a good tool that's out

238
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,840
there that will let you do the same
thing i SAT does but keep track of more

239
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,549
metrics I don't know if it's still in
