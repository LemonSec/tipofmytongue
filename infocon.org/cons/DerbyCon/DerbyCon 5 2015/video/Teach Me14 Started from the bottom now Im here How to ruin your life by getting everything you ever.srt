1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,290
I supposed to start doing things are now

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:49,410
all right now it is just very
comfortable so this is not a Tech Talk

3
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,870
it is nothing to really do with security
track stuff there's no offense or

4
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:04,869
defense to me it is the second time I've
ever tried to explain what it's like

5
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:11,670
being in the industry and Cassidy that
I've been able to be in the first time I

6
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:23,130
did it because I was really fucking I
was really pissed off and I like I went

7
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,450
to go get my talk the next day and I was
like shaking because I was so pissed and

8
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,880
I just deleted my whole slide deck like
deleted went to trash rage quit and just

9
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,619
need something in this is kind of an
iteration of that so if any of those

10
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:54,500
things don't resonate with you it
doesn't offend me that you before I

11
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,580
start any of this I love this

12
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,290
I do I do I love it and if you don't
love it I don't know what the hell

13
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:12,610
you're problem is it's so awesome to be
around such highly emotionally connected

14
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,990
industry of people that really give a
shit about each other like truly truly

15
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:24,390
care truly actually care about each
other and I know what I'm not going home

16
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,310
open admittedly you do that's why you're
in the same room together constantly

17
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:40,150
right next to each other cuddling
watching the stock except that is a

18
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:47,400
really awesome thing for a moment and
thank every one of these people working

19
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,530
thank every one of these people that put
it together everyone in the hallway

20
00:02:50,530 --> 00:03:02,490
everyone that's wearing the radio

21
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:17,490
and if you don't like how human I don't
care there's lots of other people I have

22
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:23,200
trigger warnings because I've been
brought up on triggering stuff before so

23
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,930
yeah cursing racism sex drugs violence
all the other standard shit right all

24
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,900
the stuff that really triggers you like
the stuff that you won't tell us that

25
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:52,920
hurts he decided to keep

26
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,550
about what it's like to have gone
through the shit that I've gone through

27
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,910
the industry is it some point or another
you guys have all gone through the same

28
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,760
things and at the very least it's
somebody else I can have commiserating

29
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:19,799
drink with together there's a big cost
being in this industry and the biggest

30
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,070
cost that I found my own personal life
is that I am forced to wear different

31
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:31,940
masks every single day sometimes a lot
of mess sometimes I have to go out and I

32
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,600
have to be business Chris but only
business Chris with the other side of

33
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,930
Chris on sometimes I have to be like her
death on Chris which these are all

34
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,470
really really different people most of
them don't get along and that's a hard

35
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,630
thing to manage when people are
requesting you have to be like speaker

36
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,430
which is kind of a blend of all of those
things began to turn off certain other

37
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,580
personal indicators that makes you you
in order to make it applies the larger

38
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,249
audience

39
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:10,309
professional drinking Chris I'd like to
know that you can see the liquid is

40
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:17,039
moving out of the glass and I have still
have the glass fully under control and

41
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:29,919
Java Chris trapper every once in a while
I try and make other people

42
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:38,789
uncomfortable it resorts to help them
what's really going on so I can meet

43
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:54,989
them is really human instead of the
perception of me angry pirate Chris I I

44
00:05:54,989 --> 00:06:07,049
get to be the husband Chris with
lightsabers and a song and sometimes I

45
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:13,619
have to play all these roles required to
play these roles it's not something that

46
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:17,889
I came into that I thought it'd be
really fun to make up for different

47
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,619
personalities from myself it was the way
that I could figure out how I could put

48
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:25,579
enough different masses on to
compartmentalize myself to make sure

49
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:35,849
that who I was never got completely
overrun by what I was trying to be so

50
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,169
maybe I can give you story of how I
started out by start off in connecticut

51
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:47,139
singing barbershop my uncle had a
divorced family my dad was gone my

52
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:55,289
ovaries and it was fun to learn how to
perform when I was like a little kid I

53
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,889
was in the kitchen is that

54
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:05,780
but what's good for us so I wasn't
barbershop I thought I was like punk

55
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,639
rock cyber cool when I was a little kid
that's how we did it we had stone

56
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:20,080
washing still and then I went to
highschool that our only real statistic

57
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,900
that we had nationally is that we were
second in the country for teen pregnancy

58
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:35,430
we lost football games we'd drive over
to the other schools we just beat

59
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:42,020
everyone when you know when shit
happened in school in the time that I

60
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:48,969
was there from my freshman year I had
three of my friends get shot in the

61
00:07:48,969 --> 00:08:03,740
school I had two of my friends get shot
in the house I got shot at what's there

62
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,599
is always the fast thats minority in the
school

63
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:16,810
hospitalized twice because one was
allowed in the house and an end after

64
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:22,870
somebody proceeding to tell me how to
color gang was going to be up I thought

65
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,509
it was hilarious because they were
called jungle still picture about to

66
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:33,490
this but I kept calling them the jungle
bunnies cause I thought it was funny and

67
00:08:33,490 --> 00:09:02,480
it was funny when I was in the hospital
for

68
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:11,870
school

69
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:37,800
barrier in not today know it today so I
had a really shitty experience being a

70
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:45,510
high school it was just you know we had
we had to deal with people get shot

71
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,389
killed and selling drugs just to make
sure to invest fifty right and left

72
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:56,589
after I left there and went to kansas
city and Kansas City I had to take on

73
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:00,880
another life now is coming from the east
coast and from the east coast and in the

74
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:10,730
back in town to going to do what's gonna
happen you know of course I'm an idiot I

75
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,800
have no idea Kansas even has buildings
as far as I'm concerned I'm getting out

76
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,070
of farming shit and

77
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,910
I had no idea that there was a cool
places and stuff there so you know I

78
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,750
started meeting people there ended up in
a ska bands that toured for awhile

79
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:38,210
sacks and at the same time I started
playing both importance as it is really

80
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,590
really easy neighborhood that I was
living in over the park had all these

81
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,940
green boxes everywhere and it was Kansas
the cops didn't think you were doing

82
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:52,170
anything sketchy your accounts so that
was great because I was like a deadly

83
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,400
condition which is changing pairs back
into my house and my mom had no idea

84
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,560
what is going to have to learn how
citing

85
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,430
apply to a house because I was trying to
pull telephone cables up in yet another

86
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:10,930
14 modems into the bank so I can have
more people in my BBS and it was great

87
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:18,250
because people didn't even pay attention
to it lasted you know they saw there was

88
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:28,330
just one of the rooms and had me try
wall was like why as a by-product of

89
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,890
what I call that the wedding honesty
factor where you're allowed to like get

90
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,500
married and tell your parents really
horrible shitt you've done and they have

91
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,290
to like kind of apps because you're like
on to the next phase in your life so i

92
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,060
SAT there and I told him all of the show
she's just a second you like you put up

93
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:53,279
another wall behind wall and she's like
what

94
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:06,449
it was cool I went kind of college route
that because I was going to be in

95
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:19,639
virology I said and and i cant fix it so
I started looking at some stuff I had

96
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,930
gone through much classes early and
pretty much positive people

97
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:33,009
University I can take a protease
inhibitor and be able to modify leukemia

98
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:37,329
and used to make like the superpower
white blood cells because it's really

99
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:44,870
good so i cant read steroids this is
ness and we can make them battle and I

100
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:52,449
can keep it under control you can never
do that ever and he told me to my face

101
00:12:52,449 --> 00:13:04,199
which is what I heard is your uncles
gonna die you can do nothing so why

102
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:12,769
can't I and he's like as the industry
will allow sinn fein dropped Mike Dunn

103
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm done with school I'm not I can't
pursue anything in the whole time I'm

104
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,009
still a crown of my BBS Technologies
homies that I have to do the computer

105
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:32,879
thing so I started this company shooken
doing some really fun stuff there and I

106
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,339
was coordinating trial sites which is
effectively like you know training up T

107
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:42,819
one lines that can bank workers make
money

108
00:13:42,819 --> 00:14:01,619
but then you know after their security
architect there have moved in to mention

109
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:07,429
got to touch all things in security from
from testing the compliance to labs all

110
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,449
this other stuff and wanted to see
security for a different way so I was

111
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:17,209
like ok well I've been at the customer
now been at the Carrier let me go to the

112
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:21,629
people who are carriers because they're
totally different view of the same

113
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:39,929
carrier so went KPMG and wow might not
seem like just weight lifting so so I

114
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:45,139
get into this company called alternate
technologies and their big distributor

115
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:49,669
and they want to start a security
practice that distributes like boxes so

116
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:55,079
I mean they want me to go take my
fantasies on the street or and me with

117
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:04,470
their teacher great 3000 and they knew
that I was kind of young interested in

118
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,989
the industry enough and it had enough
connections in the industry that I could

119
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:13,100
make crazy shit and people would buy it
even if I put it on the line car if you

120
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,689
have three thousand cars that are
selling to hundreds of clients each like

121
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:22,529
you can put really crazy shit out there
like red teaming right just let us break

122
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:28,009
in any way we want people to know

123
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:34,979
2000 you can't do that I can we do it
all the time and then one person like

124
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:39,139
let us do it and of course we had no
he's doing what

125
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:45,199
we did it we started going forward and
doing more and more and more of it and I

126
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:52,049
started realizing that I was kind of
sick that even richer so I decided to be

127
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:57,839
poor and start my own company was hard
transitions her transition to go from

128
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,419
like never being in a sales role to like
hey guess what you can't why because you

129
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:11,209
have your own company where is the
business go get it and then when you

130
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:16,689
don't know how to get it you sit there
in star and it hurts it's really really

131
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:20,419
hard there's nothing about starting a
business

132
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:29,220
nothing it's miserable and we all do it
at some point and every single one of us

133
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:35,410
knows like totally miserable but it's
not like I'm shooting for that 50 55 60

134
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:42,819
and you get there while that was going
on my personal life is creeping into my

135
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:49,779
professional life I didn't realize how
profound of an impact my connection with

136
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,929
with the people in DEFCON in the
community security was was really who I

137
00:16:54,929 --> 00:17:01,249
was personally I mean traveling a lot so
I didn't have friends at home there was

138
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:07,429
no I didn't I didn't have a home that
really existed when I was a spring I was

139
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:15,659
my first marriage that I went I was
doing all the security stuff I was doing

140
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:20,569
so much more security stuff and so much
less husband stuff that she rightfully

141
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:25,380
cheated on me as far as I'm concerned I
mean I was absentee

142
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:32,380
it was so hard because I had no 28
between work and personal phone and

143
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,580
homeless anymore it was 24 hours a day I
did same thing

144
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:44,419
I get a ton of smoke alone in my ask if
they make a fucking TV show right now to

145
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:49,090
add insult to injury or gas on the
Guardian fire now people are putting us

146
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,799
on TV for the poor behavior that I've
been going through of never separating

147
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:00,510
anything in my life and then we get a
podcast and people are you know

148
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:06,500
obviously wildly interested in that I
start having my famous friends making

149
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:15,510
jokes that are really funny

150
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:38,930
and unfortunately I know better but at
the time ago what am I going to do I

151
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,460
have to give back to the people that
have gotten here which is all of you

152
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:49,010
guys so ok I'm gonna start doing things
with conferences and trying to make shit

153
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:55,050
and trying to get people together to
share information and then I'm gonna go

154
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,490
out and I'm going to give talks to other
groups of people that I know I would

155
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,230
probably never be able to get front of
what I've got and like a dress up nice

156
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,290
enough when it really have to do that I
can serve for somebody who's legit

157
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:17,540
exposed to them and then collectively to
make it better

158
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:25,420
right I'm trying to absolve my own sins
by my charity to the industry and I have

159
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:34,090
a feeling that some of us have done that
so OK standards will fix this stuff

160
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,540
which makes me fly around a little place
right so one point in the last couple of

161
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:46,040
years I was averaging like 272 on
tonight

162
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:53,270
you don't fly it's a lot and that's not
just like who have his computer back and

163
00:19:53,270 --> 00:20:07,640
forth like I had a hundred and seventy
sickness say you know how do you do that

164
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:18,680
you know but but somehow all of this
totally wrong shit I was doing in my

165
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,580
life would be to empower people like oh
you're a rockstar you fly around and do

166
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,930
all these things all the time and I
might like you don't understand what's

167
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:38,020
going on behind the curtain so I figured
the best I could do as acknowledgement

168
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,690
for what I've been given from everyone
of you and from the industry is to say

169
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:49,720
here's what it's like behind me so
what's the cost of doing all of this

170
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:56,670
of the people who yell and be the person
who flies around the ship a lot of

171
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:03,410
people don't talk about the cost so I
figured I could try and if I if I break

172
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:10,470
down and i cant get thru took should
we'll get there so first off this is

173
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:20,980
life your life is reduced to a teacher
you sleep and no longer do you have the

174
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,910
fun parts of living you are so it'll
role in the reality of what you've

175
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:34,340
created that nothing exists to do
outside even if you wanted to those

176
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,790
options aren't even there because you
don't choose to have had their you and

177
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,779
this is the life you have to live

178
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:48,729
then you start going to a point where
you're like oh I met this person they're

179
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:54,129
really cool it's going alright I met
this person they're cool I have to go to

180
00:21:54,129 --> 00:22:05,779
this place and I'm really tired and have
a drink or two sleep dream car at a

181
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:12,419
level that that no one really should and
then people report you for being a

182
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:20,149
mutant up at five raging at 6:30 and
you're helping people move boxes to get

183
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:25,259
ready for talks crazy

184
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:28,539
never really resonates to you they are
actually crazy even though so many

185
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:34,769
people tell you that these are getting
older you start getting more tired which

186
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:40,889
then leads to doing other ships to stay
awake so whether it's we whether it's

187
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:47,460
coke or whatever else all of these
different things they're playing into

188
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,249
your life because you can't stop living
the life that you started

189
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:57,589
you can't get away from them ask that
you put on yourself and what happens you

190
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:01,580
have to compensate for it because it's
like a shark if you stop moving you die

191
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:09,639
and you're deathly afraid of you cannot
stand the reality that if I stop doing

192
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:14,989
this thing tomorrow I might lose my spot
I might lose my status I might not be

193
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:20,119
able to do this I might not get this
blowing smoke from the community and

194
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:25,119
might not I i might not have any
leverage to get a fuckin to become

195
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:36,809
whatever else and and all of these
things come to huge cost to life in

196
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:41,529
I first moved to Denver in between it's
funny my career path you can see like

197
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:50,090
these major explosions shook I want to
spread that was kind of my come up in my

198
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:55,730
career I got to sprint I left strict
weight it went to keep him G because my

199
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:03,049
wife cheated on me and I exploded
freaked out flip the coin got a divorce

200
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,710
took a moving truck drove it west
because the points either east or west

201
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:16,639
at West landed in Denver hung out there
for maybe 20 hours at the end of the 20

202
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:25,519
hours ago phone call that my moving
truck had been stolen this is my moving

203
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,809
truck with all the shit that I have
accumulated my entire life had been

204
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:36,360
stolen as I'm leaving my house that I'm
divorcing so I freaked out because

205
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:43,759
people would ship and happen to them too
and I decided okay I live with my

206
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:54,539
grandmother in Italy and i no disrespect
but it's a third world country with

207
00:24:54,539 --> 00:25:00,159
first world culture and I'm like living
on a farm

208
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,289
ok you're kind of at least do something
with your life have to move back like go

209
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:14,860
back get a job with KPMG which is pretty
much just like blowing C and I needed

210
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,840
the money

211
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:23,320
so whatever did you know so I get
through all that you know I'm rebuilding

212
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:30,740
my life everything's gonna bury this
great girl chest and things start to get

213
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,669
really good I start to put more of my
time in more of my understanding more of

214
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:42,220
my effort into my job again because I'm
like I'm feeling the money get like

215
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:49,919
things are good and and I'm pushing
myself because my you know my response

216
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,850
to myself was like oh you're doing this
for your family you know like she should

217
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,529
appreciate that you're bringing all your
letting her do anything she wants her

218
00:25:57,529 --> 00:25:58,600
life by you

219
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:05,520
nearly yourself that obviously didn't
work so that's two marriages down

220
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,809
because of my career and I start getting
people really hate because I have cuz I

221
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:16,870
have opinions and I think that's part of
me growing up in the ghetto school is

222
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:26,679
that I have opinions but there's all
these haters and in whether it's people

223
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,419
who are being personally hateful to me
or whether it's people in the industry

224
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:37,230
being hateful to me it really actually
hurts it's had this conversation present

225
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:46,110
fiance which thank God for that woman

226
00:26:46,110 --> 00:27:04,860
and how when people say americans are
this it's kind of excuse because we're

227
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,320
Americans that's fucked up if you see
any other person in any other country

228
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,030
races but if you say it about an
American you're just like older

229
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:20,410
americans get in the same thing hurts
our people our industry you have people

230
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,440
printing magazine articles about you
when they started off with Chris

231
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,230
Dickerson your worst nightmare that's
not shifted my moms that's not the type

232
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:38,270
of thing that I don't amount to me
that's terrible and they don't get that

233
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,390
because they want people to connect to
this fucking foot they want people to

234
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,049
connect to the image that we put up
instead of who we really are and what we

235
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:54,850
do for a living

236
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:05,730
has hurt me the most is that instead of
people trying to attack me they figured

237
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:12,260
out that I'm the type of person that's
not worth attack because my skin is

238
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:20,250
really thick and I welcome anyone in
their criticism and anyone in their

239
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:28,880
opinions and I'm more than happy to take
them and show them directly I'm happy

240
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,760
I'm good I'm the first person and many
of my really close friends will tell you

241
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:42,020
the jails cool I could sleep nice I
don't have to computer tonight

242
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,120
but when the mother fucker start
attacking my fiance and my wife that's

243
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:55,170
when it really hurts because they know
thats my points possible so because of

244
00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:01,980
my place in the industry year whoever
hates me or whatever they hate me they

245
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:09,430
decided to go after amanda is my fiance
this is a Canadian girl who has no

246
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:19,710
online life doesn't computer and has to
because she owns part of it and as soon

247
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:25,150
as they started making all these fake
profiles about her and put up all this

248
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,940
bullshit about her and tweeting the
police and putting app reviews on

249
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,640
business and all this other stuff
because of that her relationship with me

250
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:41,230
was the most toxic think I was the
reason that her life was being

251
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:52,310
systematically destroy and holy shit i
mean they took it so far that they were

252
00:29:52,310 --> 00:30:00,200
sending use condoms to her office that's
what you get for being a fucking used

253
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,310
rubber to your fiance's workplace

254
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:15,150
respectful people in this industry and
it was so hard for me to go through that

255
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:23,400
stuff but at the same time the fact that
she is such a saint and said I'm down to

256
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,020
ride that's it I don't care

257
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:32,560
let him let them send the shit I hate it
we're gonna have fights together but as

258
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:40,590
far as outside of this house its meaning
everyone in the world and so you know

259
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,900
even those raining he put the umbrella
but some guidance on you get through it

260
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:56,470
but the reason I bring that stuff is
because you start getting to a point

261
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:03,570
where you're using this profession over
your life you're gonna have to realize

262
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,280
that at some point the professions gonna
come after its going to it does it to

263
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:18,460
everybody so what can I give back around
the lessons that the stopping drinking

264
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:26,820
is probably no one so in lessons that
I've learned hard work beats talent when

265
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,240
talent doesn't work hard if you're
pissed about your level of success

266
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,070
work harder if you're not succeeding and
you think you deserve it you're probably

267
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,570
just fucking lazy and I had to learn
that the hard way to learn that

268
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:51,350
constantly every day when I look at my
family and I say is my family working

269
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:57,660
right now is my company working right
now it is not about all the external

270
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:02,950
force it's not about the people that are
emailing stuff for sending condoms are

271
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,890
making fake profiles are trolling me or
whatever it's about how focused I am I

272
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,060
in MI working and I really actually
doing it if I'm not what do I do to

273
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,610
change it

274
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:23,000
failure failure as a badge of honor if
you don't fail you have never ever ever

275
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,740
tried you have to sail to learn and
that's something that I think people in

276
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,240
our industry take for granted such a
profound way is that

277
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:41,530
everybody pretends that they've never
failed right when your devil sales

278
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,710
online your demo sales of your
presentation so get your laptop way but

279
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:54,740
just keep going when things break
appreciate how they broke and take a

280
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,420
look back at what you could do to make
it not break so that you have a future

281
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,670
of that thing not occurring don't just
say oh it broke because of this it's too

282
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:13,510
easy for us to reason away why failure
occurs being the change that you want I

283
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:23,790
have made a conscious choice to enjoy my
life and I tell you I probably should I

284
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:31,070
mean in the next 30 days I'm flying
about 35,000 the trade that I have in

285
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,970
that is that I've been home with them
industry last month and a half and

286
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:41,050
shocking as a month and a half is in the
last twelve years of my career I have

287
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:53,810
never been in a single place for a
moment we'll see you have to choose it

288
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,890
you have to pick being happy

289
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:08,380
the more that any of your conversation
deals with you or XYZ a name someone

290
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:13,870
else but my mother told me that the
probably deepest thing that I've ever

291
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:20,010
learned in morality is that when you
point out somebody you have three things

292
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:27,500
and and i'd never knew what that was a
mean shit through two marriages are

293
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,500
still had no idea that was good I'm
starting to get it I'm starting to get

294
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,699
that happiness is something that I
choose not something that I i want it

295
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:43,889
something that I pick I don't need a
reason I don't need to go well this and

296
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:48,010
this and this and this and this and this
and if you put those together here and

297
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,730
here is the risk model who's that chick
such a fucking to work every day instead

298
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:59,080
I go okay take all these numbers throw
them away I'm gonna pick being happy

299
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:11,650
tonight what does that mean hard skills
it's way harder than Metasploit harder

300
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:18,510
so if you can actually get to a point
where you choose those things it sets

301
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:24,540
you up for an ability in life that you
can really truly grow and still love

302
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,190
what you do

303
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:36,260
family is a big and I don't care if that
means you have no family because your

304
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,560
endorsement or if you have a giant
family or whatever else family is what

305
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:50,000
you make it and when you make it
continued to make time never ever

306
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,240
ignored if you if you sit here and go oh
sorry I you know I forgot to call you to

307
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:05,220
call your family today I I say that
because I've done that hundreds of times

308
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:11,640
but I think about it and I'm like why
couldn't have called you at lunch when I

309
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,940
was cleaning my way could not have set a
higher checked inner-city were stupid

310
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,300
wake will slap happy 100 fingernail
paint but we never thought about these

311
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,530
anything

312
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:28,740
why didn't I just like touch you and
check in in some way all the time

313
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:35,580
because I know when people do that for
me it feels good hits my recent but when

314
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,940
I'm getting really really stressed out
and it's too intense for me to live

315
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:45,090
somebody can send me once to protect
mushy pictures you know the picture

316
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,020
Hitler

317
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:52,560
you know gangster rap uniform asking how
much the Holocaust like you know like

318
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,590
even if it's just more bad I still love
it still freaks me out of what's going

319
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:03,280
on so do it just do it just choose to do
it do it

320
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:12,250
public and private this is something
that I'm still figuring out so i cant

321
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:23,120
talk about it we have to wear on this
and and sometimes you wear those master

322
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:31,480
safety sometimes you wear those masks
because fear and my way of dealing with

323
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:41,600
this is by separating public and private
into place those classes are people I

324
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:49,500
know because of where or whatever else
just a quick people that are my friends

325
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:56,120
which are very very very small because
most people who come up to me and

326
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,380
they're like yeah I mean you know how
many times I have to deal with only

327
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:08,630
courses in a school for mother who's
never met me never ever ever met face

328
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:14,230
right they met me talking shit on stage
like smashing some company

329
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,770
but but not me as human as the person
that I am with my wife not me sitting

330
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:24,869
there at the BBQ grill feeding everybody
making sure that my job is to make sure

331
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:37,900
that everyone is not that they meet over
here on stage anything stop is good but

332
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:43,910
what separates some of those things and
really truly pick who and why and where

333
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:49,960
you interact try and take a moment while
you guys are here because this is this

334
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,010
is the biggest problem at conferences
this really hard to deal with it is

335
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:58,180
harder to deal with for me try and take
the stance that you're not going to have

336
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:03,770
any interaction with somebody that's not
meaningful and if you're if you're if

337
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:09,400
you're gonna sit and talk to someone
else and have ok with somebody thirty

338
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:16,670
second thing the ability to give them
one minute if you can't go past that one

339
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:22,369
minute look them in the face and tell
them I cannot have a meaningful

340
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:28,550
conversation right now but I want to
lose at least understand that you mean

341
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:40,869
that much to tell people that you're
going to be unreasonable about the

342
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:45,760
meaning of your conversations with your
time in their time is valuable to you

343
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:54,920
because we do not have but time is
something that every single one of us we

344
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,380
get our asses work to the fucking phone
people expect us to build on multiple

345
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,790
projects and do shit like move mountains
in

346
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:07,010
tenth of the time of what's projected to
do it and we're supposed to do it

347
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:14,840
because but if we can give each other
time and really truly means something

348
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,230
about the time that we give each other
I'll tell you the gifts that you get

349
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:33,270
back from meaningful conversations are
believed you are in if you give a talk

350
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:41,460
on a date I love you to death I do but
i'd like i'd love you from the bottom of

351
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:48,680
my heart and and watching you watching
you get rat holes in the beginning of

352
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:57,700
guy who made so instead of days was hard
for me it's hard for me watching you are

353
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,060
around conferences and beat guy who made
set instant connections both these other

354
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,300
people but not david has you as a person
of the most amazing mother fucker I met

355
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:15,140
a really long time and and there's
there's a point where you have to choose

356
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,760
I am NOT the person that you guys want
me to be

357
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,270
I'm still me i'm not the person on the
stage yelling and ranting and send them

358
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:31,950
to you know what i mean but

359
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:42,190
but just be yourself

360
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:47,610
just do it and if those moments where
you feel like you're not yourself it's

361
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:52,620
ok to take a break it's ok to just be
like to go to bathroom that have like

362
00:41:52,620 --> 00:42:01,110
the one on one figure out get back in
the game but do it it's what it's worth

363
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:04,890
those couple minutes to like put
yourself in checking it used to putting

364
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:27,310
yourself in check instead of evolving
into something a lot of people and the

365
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:57,420
ship supports the people taking care of
trolling some impact I have a feeling

366
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,640
that you would step in and be like oh
don't punch people it's

367
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:12,690
troll somebody will it was good fun to
look at their face and happy so we need

368
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:18,520
some awareness we need to make sure that
we take care of our own and in doing

369
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,300
that the foundation of that is don't be
a dick don't be an asshole you don't

370
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:30,470
have to be leaders

371
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:40,200
I just love it if you say that people
use the problem that doesn't mean that

372
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,790
you have to be on the keys everyday they
have to do this or do that but if you're

373
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:50,190
not on the team and the team works for
you your the fucking excuse yourself

374
00:43:50,190 --> 00:44:03,820
find another industry we discuss we
discussed that it's just when when you

375
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:11,650
train with people trade with that don't
tell somebody how to do it in wait for

376
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,400
results

377
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,010
train with them if you know how to do it

378
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,470
walk them through the steps even if you
don't know how to do it and you can get

379
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,619
them to a point

380
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:26,810
walk them up until that point and let
the expression of you being two gether

381
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:35,150
the something we don't just go ahead and
walk away your time doesn't mean

382
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:47,609
anything that you have the education
don't judge the one one of the times

383
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:55,900
that I was written up in one of our
security magazines or whatever it is it

384
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:04,570
was me out and Marcus Ranum together and
there was a lady that stood up and was

385
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,770
pandering to the audience and she was
like well we wouldn't have any of these

386
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:10,970
problems if it wasn't for the users

387
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:19,359
clapping and all of us are furious and I
stood up and out tried to pull him back

388
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,119
and it didn't work

389
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:28,079
and I was like ok so you know lady
pandering to the audience do you have

390
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,460
kids and she's like the kids do you have
them children the little things out of

391
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,019
you

392
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:44,259
you know she's OK when your kids were
little they didn't know how to speak to

393
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:50,910
you don't know anything you're an idiot

394
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:59,420
here is that how you treated your kids
and she's just like like trying to do

395
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:08,980
the dog like if I don't see you you
don't see anything but we need to take

396
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,240
the time to educate them if you think
someone is the problem you have

397
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,999
identified the person you need to
educate if you say that they're the

398
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:22,890
problem again you didn't do your job
it's your fault at that point it becomes

399
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:31,999
your you've identified it you didn't fix
it it's your fault for help is not

400
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:40,739
failing at all I learned almost
everything that I've ever learned in

401
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:47,140
this profession by going to conferences
and meeting people because every single

402
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:56,759
and i know i have a wealth of knowledge
to learn from every single there is no

403
00:46:56,759 --> 00:47:00,680
one here that I can't fundamentally
change my life with the knowledge that

404
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:17,279
day and get on stage we're not gonna
progress just sit there and just be

405
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:23,329
better than everybody and it's bullshit
you're not i mean I know homeless people

406
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:27,589
that are much smarter than you

407
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:44,309
the damn thing unless we learn from the
party and conferencing just keep it up

408
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:51,729
like that and there's a certain point in
my life you know the difference between

409
00:47:51,729 --> 00:48:01,549
three o'clock and five is probably be
there soon so maybe at 3:45 I'm

410
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:08,759
definitely not the proponents say want
everybody to play together and in

411
00:48:08,759 --> 00:48:11,769
whatever capacity you wanna play
together play together that's how

412
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:17,609
innovation happens that's I mean I don't
know how many times as you do right and

413
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:19,769
head weird part at the end drone

414
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:24,309
scribbling hieroglyphs of shit and then
all the sudden like a brand new product
