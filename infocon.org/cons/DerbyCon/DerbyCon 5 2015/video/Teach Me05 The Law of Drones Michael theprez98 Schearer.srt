1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,650
good afternoon everyone my name is
Michael shear friends 98 and I'll be

2
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,900
talking about drones today but
specifically the log drones in other

3
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,719
words the legal aspects flying drones
about doing things for the drone sort of

4
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:44,320
a little bit of history a little bit of
history of drones as well as history of

5
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,760
airspace and that sort of thing and what
is the current state law as well as a

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,149
number of current applications that you
may have seen the news and things like

7
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,890
that and then leave a little bit of time
of questions cuz I'm sure you'll have

8
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:06,810
some so little bit about myself I spent
almost nine years in the United States

9
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,250
Navy as a naval flight officer doing
electronic counter-measures sixty

10
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,729
prowler so electronic attack jamming
that sort of thing about a thousand

11
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:25,360
hours in the aircraft I currently work
for without Hamilton I'm a Network

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,079
Analyst government contractor and I'm a
fourth year law student at the

13
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:36,110
University of Maryland so I'll be
graduating in May finally so you meet

14
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,540
you may notice in the picture that I'm
sitting out in the plane that that

15
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,619
that's an ejection seat and above my
head and behind my head there's a yellow

16
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,650
and black cable that she pulled that you
go through the canopy so

17
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,700
don't pull that unless you really want
to exit the aircraft she ever go to an

18
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:14,140
airshow you get to go into a cockpit
anything that is black and yellow so one

19
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,280
of the things that I like to talk about
in my talks like to preface in my talks

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,050
is why you should be skeptical of the
things I'm talking about and the reason

21
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,140
is is that why I do this alot

22
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,890
do drones like deal with legal issues of
germans there's probably some out

23
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:38,660
someone out there who is smarter than me
so I don't necessarily know everything

24
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,520
that I'm talking about I think I do but
I might be wrong I'm not a lawyer close

25
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,890
to being that 85 percent of the way
there but I'm not aware so there may be

26
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,990
issues that I don't necessarily
understand fully but I think I

27
00:02:51,990 --> 00:03:00,790
understand them pretty well enough to
talk about them and secondly it's just

28
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:07,080
something that i think is important to
stress that you know maybe I'm an expert

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,370
maybe I'm not but it's important if you
if you have questions about things I say

30
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,680
questioned me about it you know

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,070
raised a hand in and ask question one of
the things I want to start off with

32
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,420
before I get my book my talk is
terminology the long ongoing debate in

33
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,170
the community in the trunk community
about what to call trials and these are

34
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,190
and there's good reason for this a
decade ago she heard the word drone you

35
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,920
thinking of a predator UAV flying over
Afghanistan or Yemen and checking out

36
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,560
some

37
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,270
you know al Qaeda terrorists so when
people talk about using drones something

38
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:49,770
like this which is certainly not going
to you know she's a Hellfire missile in

39
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,200
all necessarily want the connotations
the negative connotations that come

40
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,540
along with that so these are just some
of the words people in the community

41
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,319
have suggested for alternative names for
drones for the purpose of this

42
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,239
presentation and using drones cuz it's
easy but Brown I mean really

43
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,569
commercial drones would use that I'm an
aerial vehicle UAV unmanned aerial

44
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:21,280
systems small unmanned aerial system
remotely piloted aircraft remote how did

45
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,510
vehicle remote piloted aerial system
that's not really what I just added that

46
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:35,100
because I turned wrong with the purposes
presentation that's what I'll be using

47
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:42,120
so much talk about history and anybody
here take a lot in high school

48
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:51,990
ok if you if you so there's a doctrine
that's appreciated too cold I told them

49
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,430
which basically means who's ever in the
soil it is there's all the way to the

50
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,370
heaven and all the way to help this is
all common law doctrine developed

51
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,690
probably eight in the Middle Ages and
essentially meant that if you own

52
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,350
property you own everything above it and
everything below it and we still see a

53
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,510
little bit of us today if you own
property and you have oil or mineral

54
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,820
property you can least that those rights
to a company

55
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:27,580
the airside is little bit interesting
because up until maybe this at least

56
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,430
1,700 there really was no challenge to
the airside right i mean there was

57
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,160
nobody doing anything in the air over
your property but then along came these

58
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,840
guys late 1800's people started flying
hot air balloons turn of the century

59
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,390
into the twenty twentieth century the
Wright brothers started flying around in

60
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,750
every every their aircraft and suddenly
we have we have an issue with this

61
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,720
doctrine that's the idea of flying about
someone's property what can you do it

62
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,370
someone above someone's property what if
you're fifty feet or five thousand so

63
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,190
this doctrine underwent a challenge and
this was a case at the end of world war

64
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:17,100
two from a chicken farmer in North
Carolina who was whose farm is adjacent

65
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,650
to an Army Airfield where they were
doing training flights for the military

66
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:29,690
and they were flying all day long over
his over his farm at 83 sheet was but

67
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,980
they calculated farm the chickens are
going crazy they're killing themselves

68
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,620
are doing it cuz they can't they just
noise all this noise so he sued the

69
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,350
United States government for taking
property property violation and the

70
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,900
court said that the doctor had no place
in the modern world so that kinda threw

71
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,790
it out but they did say that they were
flying solo 83 sheet that the government

72
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:58,500
should compensate him for damages costs
and the doctrine that came out of this

73
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,920
case case is known as he and developing
atmosphere and what this means is that

74
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,990
if you have a piece of property in the
air over your property to the extent

75
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,710
that you can actively use it in other
words if you have a ham radio tower on

76
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,590
your property that goes up 250 feet well
thank you own the airspace up 250 feet

77
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,480
now there may be code reasons why you
can't go higher than that you know it's

78
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:30,450
certain areas but whatever you can use
his developing atmosphere so that's sort

79
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,520
of the current state of the law as it
applies to drones and we'll get into

80
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:45,410
that more as we see some more modern so
that's really history in a nutshell air

81
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,800
rights or rights to the air over a piece
of property

82
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,720
there's a lot more detail than that but
that should give you an idea of where

83
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:01,310
we're going to talk about the National
Airspace System because now we're

84
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,350
talking about integrating an object like
this or something bigger or smaller into

85
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,230
the National Airspace System National
Airspace System is we're going to focus

86
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,380
on the United States here the airspace
that's that's controlled by the

87
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:25,530
government under the authority of the
FAA air space looks something like this

88
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:32,710
divided into classes and depending upon
what class of airspace your end or a

89
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:40,520
different rules the ones that I want to
talk about in detail our class aid which

90
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,740
is the red at the top

91
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,440
everything over 18,000 feet

92
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,190
this is all I frm unique instrument
flight rules are you fly when you came

93
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:56,580
to Derby probably no drones are gonna be
flying up there no no Bobby Jones are

94
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,530
gonna be flying up there when I want to
talk about as Class B airspace this is

95
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,900
the yellow the large yellow one that
looks like an upside-down wedding cake

96
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:14,930
this class B think of busy airport right
so busy airports have class B airspace

97
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,520
so you have a certain amount of air
space like and the further you go up in

98
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:28,040
altitude the wire here in Louisville
it's theirs Class C airspace so it's a

99
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,600
little bit smaller but those are
important because to fly into class B or

100
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,380
Class C airspace you need to talk to air
traffic control while that might be

101
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,100
difficult for someone on the ground with
the drone who doesn't have a radio on

102
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,220
the aircraft or even to talk to you so
how do you deal with that something will

103
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:58,340
talk about as well this is just a little
bit of a part of Class B airspace around

104
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,020
BWI Airport this is baltimore-washington
International which is between Baltimore

105
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,600
and Washington Dec maybe a little
difficult to see but there's a bunch of

106
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,960
concentric circles and I have them
circled in red and that tells you the

107
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,320
the low and high altitudes for that
concentric circle so for example the

108
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,490
first one out here is a hundred over 35
so what that means is the Class B

109
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,440
airspace closed up to 10,000 feet and
starts at 3500 she so if you are out

110
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,130
here on the right side of the map you
can fly up to 3,500 feet without being

111
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,960
in the Class B airspace

112
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,720
when you get into the next circle it is
25 and 15 so you can see how it's

113
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,070
getting lower and lower take it began as
an upside-down wedding cake with the

114
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,500
airport in the middle

115
00:10:49,500 --> 00:11:03,580
the further you get away higher in this
further out echoes in 2003 the FAA

116
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,190
promulgated a flight restricted zone
around the district of columbia this

117
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:15,300
actually larger than the BWS airspace
this is a temporary flight restriction

118
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:25,890
enacted in 2003 2003 the sticks and I
think 25 miles from the District of

119
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:31,650
Columbia and goes from the surface
starts at the surface it goes as they

120
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:41,210
wanted to go so this actually covers
where I live so by the strict

121
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:46,310
interpretation of the FAA rules I can't
fly drones in my backyard because of

122
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:54,180
these rules even though I'm 45 minute
drive elation D C and this

123
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:00,440
sort of so we'll talk about the truck
crashed at the white house lawn but the

124
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,460
company to manufacture Sistrunk GJ I
actually started updating the firmware

125
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,450
to have essentially geosciences a few
she turned on your truck and get a GPS

126
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:18,120
sink in this area will take care

127
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,370
this is the Louisville classy airspace
you can see the airport in the middle

128
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:32,320
and it's a little bit there's a little
section goes out of an aside but in the

129
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,899
inside circle it's the surface to 4,500
feet and the outside circle is different

130
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:47,030
section 1,700 and 2,200 so that should

131
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,360
very brief primer on the National
Airspace System to give you an idea of

132
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,840
the things that someone has to think
about before they want to fly so if you

133
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,420
want to fly a droning you live within
five miles of an airport probably could

134
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,150
think about what you're doing before you
do it especially when you might be on

135
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:12,150
the approach vector most people who buy
commercial drones are not thinking about

136
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,230
that

137
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:19,260
back in

138
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,520
12 the law called the FAA modernization
and Reform Act and what this law did was

139
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,110
this is the first regulation of unmanned
aerial systems and essentially deals

140
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,700
with commercial uses drones in other
words if you want to make money off your

141
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:41,580
drones flying if you wanna fly you short
run for weddings or funerals or whatever

142
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,560
their roles and we'll talk a little bit
about that and it made a special

143
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,100
exemption from model aircraft which
drones fall under that exemption from

144
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:59,700
model aircraft if you're using the drug
for hobby or recreational purposes the

145
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,230
FAA put out an advisory circular in 1981
that dealt with model aircraft and these

146
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,440
are the rules that the FAA problem hobby
recreational use only staying under for

147
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,130
notifying the tower when you're within
three miles of an airfield note the

148
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,460
-notify not ask permission

149
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:27,150
notify and follow a community-based safe
community based safety guidelines and

150
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,600
their organizations out there trade
organizations that people who fly model

151
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,100
aircraft and a half Community Guidelines
and all sorts of things in 1981 really

152
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,340
drones like this but now there are and
they fought fallen generally fall under

153
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:51,810
those shorts the FAA actually updated
that circular about three weeks ago so

154
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,070
for making a one two three weeks ago
basically have the same rules except

155
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,880
they extended it from three miles 25
miles and they stressed enforcement

156
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,380
actions that the FAA can take so while
congress said that model aircraft were

157
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,450
exempt the FAA still maintains that they
can enforce

158
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:15,420
dangerous why

159
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,320
the executive branch agency like the FAA
wants to promulgate rules they have to

160
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,780
post a notice of proposed rulemaking you
may be familiar with regulations.gov can

161
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:32,060
go there you can type in any subject and
agencies will post proposed rules and

162
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:39,060
you can make comments on the FAA
proposed a rule for certification it

163
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,210
closed in April and again this rule only
applies to commercial use

164
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,000
so what if you wanted to fly drones for
commercial usage right now according to

165
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,870
the law you have to apply for what's
called the section 333 exemption from

166
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,310
the FAA and explain what you're gonna do
for your business and they're actually

167
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,320
approving them pretty quickly now but
then to actually fly the drone for

168
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,330
commercial use you have to have a
private pilot's license under the

169
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,250
current rules to make money from your
drone you have to have a private pilot's

170
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:25,030
license to be the pilot of the drone

171
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:32,010
talk about one enforcement action at the
FAA has taken a little bit later they

172
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,830
are being very hands off right now
because they know that they're gonna get

173
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,770
slapped down as soon as it so this rule
the proposed rule that that therefore

174
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,260
the rule that they're proposing would do
away with the pilot license requirement

175
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,610
that you would have to take some kind of
like FAA test learning about the

176
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,340
airspace in that sort of thing it's a
little bit less onerous than it would be

177
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:01,480
right now although they are proving that
pretty quickly right now even giving

178
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,080
that under the proposed rule stay under
500 feet line of sight meaning you can't

179
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,850
fly out of where you can see a big
problem for companies like amazon.com

180
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:17,910
and only during data so this really like
really limits what you can do

181
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,920
you can I can tell you these will be
challenged the minute they get published

182
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:28,830
in the Federal so there's really only
one case where the FAA brought an

183
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,610
enforcement action against this guy
named Raffaele per and he was hired to

184
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:39,010
fly a drone at a university in virginia
to capture footage video and photographs

185
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,150
for a university you know advertising
campaign

186
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,570
the FAA originally ruled against so he
flew is run around and apparently some

187
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,270
people on the ground who were scared of
it so they complain to the FAA and the

188
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:00,500
FAA rules said that you violated the
rule that you have to fly safe flying

189
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,680
over people's heads the buildings etc
etc

190
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:12,760
administrative law judge for the FAA a
backup the FAA finding against him was

191
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,590
rule based upon the fact that aircraft
as defined by the federal government

192
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,610
includes something like this

193
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:24,330
administrative law judge reversed it
saying this is a model aircraft not an

194
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,470
aircraft and the national currency
Transportation Safety Board reversed

195
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,160
again sing and model aircraft is an
aircraft all these decisions are about

196
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,400
definitions what is a model aircraft and
what is an aircraft if something is not

197
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,410
an aircraft the FAA doesn't have
authority over even after the NTSB

198
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:49,300
reversed this case was settled so they
tried to find him $10,000 he ended up

199
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,940
paying $1000 to settle the case and the
important factor here is this case never

200
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,820
reached an article three quarts of a
little bit of background all the

201
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,160
enforcement actions against him were
done by an executive branch agency if he

202
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,480
wanted to appeal the NTSB case would go
to a federal district court

203
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,980
article three quarter judicial branch
court

204
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,320
so this case because it was settle
because it was done by an executive

205
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,450
branch really have any authority so it's
really unsettled there's nobody knows

206
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:27,040
what the answers to these questions I'm
just gonna run through a bunch of

207
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,049
pictures issues that you may have seen
in the news over the last few years just

208
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:36,419
to give you an idea of this isn't just
some person in the backyard flying a

209
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:41,990
drawing there's a lot of potential uses
good and bad for this sort of activity

210
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:49,150
this one you may have seen this one so
there's a guy who works for the National

211
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,250
Reconnaissance Office and intelligence
agency of the United States government

212
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:58,260
who goes to a party in washingtonDC gets
drunk and decide that he's going to ply

213
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,500
his buddies drove around washington
downtown washington D C while drunk

214
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,330
drivers to lose control of it doesn't
know where the drugs when wakes up in

215
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,020
the morning and sees that a drone has
crashed on the white house lawn and does

216
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,940
the finally smart thing and called them
up and says that was me so this was a

217
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:28,950
deejay action I'm just like the one I
have here is suffered some damage and I

218
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,610
think there was a mild enforcement
action against them eventually but it

219
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,400
wasn't a big deal but this was the first
this sort of propelled runs into the

220
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,980
news in the least in the last year more
so than anything else

221
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:48,450
Jones carrying drugs how many have you
seen cases where drones crashed around

222
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,770
the border China carry drugs across the
border

223
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,620
this is a larger trunk but obviously
they packed it too many drugs and I mean

224
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:04,020
obviously they didn't they weren't good
engineers because they were Amazon wants

225
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,440
to deliver packages you seen their
videos again going back to the

226
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,690
commercial uses commercial uses our line
of sight so how can Amazon fly drones

227
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,080
from five miles are 10 miles away from
the house so those current restrictions

228
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,470
essentially prohibiting Amazon from
doing this so what are they doing

229
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,780
they're going to Canada they're going to
europe they're going to other places

230
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:36,480
where they can do testing because they
can't do it here in the states right

231
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,000
exactly the same exact same comment
about the military have pilots to all

232
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,400
this and so military drones operated
entirely different legal spectro so the

233
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,850
rules the current rules are sort of
probe head in in this case short of

234
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,840
holding back

235
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,020
innovation from happening this is a
pretty interesting one this is this

236
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,460
comes out of lebanon the country of
lebanon but I've seen this in Australia

237
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,669
to where they have drones on the beach
with life preservers and when they have

238
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:10,900
swimmers in distress they just flying
out for the lifeguard can get there so

239
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,110
pleased to have something to you know to
hold it hold off the guy in till

240
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:23,990
somebody can get to them I've also seen
Jones done drug testing with AEDs in

241
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,870
other medical devices so these are
things that are sort of testing not

242
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,809
really in production yet but certainly
good possibilities this is called The

243
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:36,690
Guardian

244
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,690
California interfering with firefighting
operations

245
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:47,350
some of these cases shockingly have been
overblown in one case it turned out that

246
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:54,389
11 of these fires happened in an area
where people actively fly drones so it's

247
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:58,509
not like they just showed up and said
hey let's go fly over the fire this was

248
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:03,799
an area large open area very popular
German flyers and the fire just happened

249
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,740
it happened in that area so but there
are cases where where drones have

250
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,049
interrupted firefighting operations so
that's something that has to be

251
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:19,159
regulated in the more two more times
things like this happen then you can

252
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,909
just imagine heavy-handed regulation
coming down there a crash rees-jones

253
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:30,259
this truck crash proof his truck has
essentially a cage around it so that it

254
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:34,340
can bump into things and it won't
interrupt the propellers this one and

255
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,490
this one million dollars by the way the
competition there are drawn film

256
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,200
festivals there's one in New York City
there's one there's a couple different

257
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,360
ones and if you watch the videos they're
really pretty cool I don't know if you

258
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,490
guys ever watch like HDTV or those like
house hunter shows if you see some of

259
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,580
those shows

260
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,700
after you watch them awhile you'll start
seeing shots and realize that was done

261
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,370
with the drone that was some of the draw
means all over the place

262
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:13,559
there's also privacy issues

263
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:18,840
surprisingly to dealing drugs there are
this was a I think this visit from

264
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:25,269
Colorado town proposing to issue drone
hunting permits for people to shoot out

265
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:32,529
in droves you can see the issues here
aside from the drones I think those of

266
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:37,179
you who who are active in the fires
community shooting it generally into the

267
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:41,100
air is not a good idea and is generally
gonna get you at the least a disorderly

268
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,889
conduct reckless endangerment charge no
matter what you're doing then there's

269
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:58,029
this guy Johnny jewel hunter defender of
privacy ok this is really well I mean

270
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:09,000
it's it's some guy I guess how many of
you have seen a GoPro camera what most

271
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,510
people don't understand this but you
know because you have a wide angle lens

272
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,880
right and so hard to turn on the camera
here just for you guys I mean it would

273
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,330
look further away than understanding
from you

274
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,960
these are not things that used to invade
someone's privacy and I'll show you a

275
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,889
couple videos what what a drone looks
like flying at two hundred feet and what

276
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:35,299
you asked me if I asked you is at
invading someone's privacy interactions

277
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,000
with the government and law enforcement
this is actually a picture taken from a

278
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,119
drunken not mine but taken from someone
in there

279
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:48,049
drunk community who is flying and the
police happen to pull up and they

280
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:50,929
actually so you might think this turns
out poorly but it didn't actually

281
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:55,939
challenged him to land it on the police
car and and he politely decline which is

282
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:58,859
a smart idea but they actually thought
it was cool

283
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:02,769
the majority of law enforcement that
I've talked to you are don't seem to

284
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:08,699
have a problem with drones I did deal
with one park ranger who was trying to

285
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:13,809
enforce the model aircraft are also a
place we walked away but most people

286
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,889
that I've talked to a survey Jenna
informal survey among people in the

287
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:21,799
community found that most people's
interactions with government law

288
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:28,509
enforcement officials have been
generally positive there's a couple of

289
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:33,279
issues and i wanna talk about first of
all and these are issues that are to be

290
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,509
challenges going forward for dealing
with Charles everything I've talked

291
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:41,969
about essentially so far has been
federal law

292
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:48,299
FAA what about states what about local
governments so you may be inherited

293
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,889
let's say you want to fly here in
Louisville how do you know if you can

294
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:57,419
try right outside the school while
actually outside the five mile limit

295
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:02,339
from the airport straight line distance
so we're not in the five miles to call

296
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:08,249
them up we are in the Class C airspace
but that shouldn't matter anyway so

297
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:17,669
theoretically you could fly under the
FAA's roles what about yes I will be

298
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:27,220
here tomorrow you can I will be here all
day

299
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:35,429
tomorrow we can talk about it so under
the FDA's rules you could fly right

300
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:39,830
outside this right outside the hotel
what about the state of Kentucky today I

301
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,960
need romance 101 about Louisville maybe
they have a sim city ordinance that you

302
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,840
can't fly within the downtown area it's
very difficult to necessarily know

303
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,970
everything that's going on their first
amendment issues

304
00:27:53,970 --> 00:28:04,690
yeah sure so that's that's another issue
and that that's actually this all

305
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,140
internet based on this case is just in
case

306
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:13,510
Connecticut where there was an activist
car action and a guy who works for a

307
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,710
news agency was also drawn fire you up
above the above the crime scene of the

308
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,409
accident

309
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:25,500
yeah and they approached him and asked
him to do you take it down or 22 landed

310
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,539
jiron said there any charged him with
interfering with the crime scene or

311
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:30,799
something like that

312
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,299
what's the difference of a news
helicopter flying at eight thousand feet

313
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:39,270
or a drone flying at 450 feet which is
where the Scottish lie or the issue of

314
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,659
someone who is standing behind the crime
scene tape who's closer than he is by

315
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:49,070
flying his drone anyway this guy and it
up he filed a lawsuit against the

316
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,919
government

317
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,070
end up losing its a district court case
that really a presidential thing right

318
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,070
now but their potential first amendment
issues so the issue that you raised of

319
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:03,409
privacy it really comes down to
infliction of two issues right so

320
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,960
generally 40 photography is a first
there's first amendment issues with

321
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,960
photography in other words if you're
standing on public property can take

322
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,630
pictures were so the issue then is my
right as a photographer to take pictures

323
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:23,350
of people on the street versus their
right to privacy in that case generally

324
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,280
the courts are going to say that

325
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,820
when you're out in public you have no
expectation of privacy just walking up

326
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:37,530
the street and that's why you see
surveillance cameras then that maybe

327
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,660
that becomes an issue

328
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,270
absolutely because people in their hotel
rooms have an expectation of privacy

329
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:48,570
unless maybe the curtains are open you
know who knows and these are these are

330
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:53,810
important facts if you had one of those
suites at the top floor at Caesars that

331
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:57,550
have the window strength at Caesars
Palace in Las Vegas to have the windows

332
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,770
from the floor to the ceiling open all
the way women maybe that's not you don't

333
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:08,700
have an expectation of privacy in what
you're doing in the room we also talked

334
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,580
I also talked about the fourth amendment
issues some states are passing some

335
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,090
states are now passing laws that police
can't use drones unless they get a

336
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,820
warrant so maybe that or maybe that's
too far again we're involving area of

337
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,630
law and so it's important to think about
a lot of these issues such as about

338
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:33,350
flying drone first-amendment Fourth
Amendment privacy regulations FAA state

339
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,570
governments local governance a lot to
handle for most people who are buying a

340
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:45,480
drone and have no legal training when it
play if this I pray this works some

341
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,290
videos so one of the things you can do
just examples of things you can do with

342
00:30:51,290 --> 00:31:05,100
Charles this is a light that a planned
around

343
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:21,770
around Westfield Mall it out with this
is just a point still the attitude you

344
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,549
know just fine just fine

345
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:38,929
very fast around the outside wall and
just this is programmed route and lots

346
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:41,110
of fresh start

347
00:31:41,110 --> 00:32:00,390
just oppose the route you can do a point
six points for the camera is generally

348
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:06,900
facie tort about a 35 degree angle down
but I can actually control to go from

349
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:14,530
break down to 90 degrees so I have no
idea motion camera and then I I can also

350
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:19,270
control the trial obviously directions
can pretty much do I will show this

351
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:40,620
whole thing but i just want to show some
of that

352
00:32:40,620 --> 00:33:17,750
video one of the issues that
inexperienced pilots will have called

353
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:29,270
for texturing state question that's a
good question what APIs probably the

354
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,550
same thing that would happen if I saw
his question was what happens if my

355
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:38,980
drone crashes in and it's a person or a
car or something like that so how do you

356
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,500
deal with that probably the same thing
that would happen if my car hit his car

357
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:51,040
or if I hit him it's probably just tort
accident in other words it's an accident

358
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,700
they happen if she wants to file a claim
against me if I wasn't sure if you

359
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,640
probably can and that's probably how
it's going to go down but they're sick

360
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,150
there's been so few of those issues
happening so it's not really clear what

361
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:10,240
exactly the sort of normal expectation
is for that's why some people have said

362
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,500
they will only fly over areas where
there's no 10 people well then you're

363
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:21,070
gonna miss out on certain things so it's
just it's it's a challenge for the

364
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:27,200
individual person determine what to do
where you gonna fly you know you see

365
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,550
videos of people flying for fireworks I
mean you can do it if you want whether

366
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,349
or not you know it's safe

367
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:40,319
so for texturing state is is it is a
something that happens with helicopters

368
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:44,919
and this is what happens when when
helicopters generating lift when you're

369
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:49,589
just sending a helicopter the air that
dirty air underneath the propellers

370
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:56,549
recycles to go about their propellers
and you just have this situation we

371
00:34:56,549 --> 00:35:02,279
start losing left and when you're
falling in aircraft and in a drone the

372
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:07,140
first thing you think about adding power
and you had power for texturing state

373
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,430
you actually start descending more cos
you're you're feeding the cycle of dirty

374
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:16,880
air so this actually happens with drones
as well start descending really fast you

375
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,729
can actually start flying into your own
dirty air and you can lose control your

376
00:35:21,729 --> 00:35:27,220
truck crash so while generally adding
powers a good way to get out of any

377
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:31,849
problem just happens for pilots in the
John Paulson no idea what what's going

378
00:35:31,849 --> 00:36:15,510
forward

379
00:36:15,510 --> 00:37:11,460
so we started flying over the fire is a
few times we fight directly for the most

380
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:18,710
part over where firefighters so it's an
interesting one but that's an issue

381
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:25,410
doing anything wrong she doing anything
that a news helicopter is lower so maybe

382
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:44,190
that's an issue about this this case for
this guy here talkie took a shot at a

383
00:37:44,190 --> 00:38:02,460
guy who was spying on his daughter's
friend

384
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:13,060
so I will tell you based on experience
this right here he's flying about a

385
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:50,080
hundred and fifty to two hundred she
said and so that's what's up so I think

386
00:38:50,080 --> 00:39:01,470
it is claimed that I think it is claimed
that it was something like that

387
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:15,180
as you can see

388
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:26,240
and essentially flies after another net
to bring it down all sorts of things you

389
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:43,720
can do these days about a couple
resources that are available to you well

390
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:50,210
maybe not quite yet the FAA FAA recently
put out an app called before you fly and

391
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:56,260
essentially this is the way of the FAA
saying hey these fly there's these

392
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:02,829
airports in these things around you and
they can thus promoting awareness

393
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:10,660
however because they're the FAA only
released this beta 2000 users who does

394
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,180
that

395
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:18,660
so unless you are one of those thousand
users who can't actually used it is what

396
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:31,630
it is you can just go to any geographic
location airspace this is actually the

397
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:38,369
map for Louisville assumed out a little
bit the orange circles are five mile

398
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:45,670
radius is from an airport and then the
purple is the Class C airspace fluid so

399
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:52,329
you can see that where the GOP point is
actually outside of the five mile limit

400
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:56,799
so you know the contact that our but we
are in the Class B airspace or Class E

401
00:40:56,799 --> 00:41:02,460
airspace so maybe Chicago but it's not
really clear what you're supposed to do

402
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:09,780
my presentation has an article that
across again it's notify the tower not

403
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,700
casper you don't ask for permission

404
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:21,109
website called no fly zone dot org where
you can put in your address and creating

405
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:26,950
a database of people who don't want your
own flying over the house whether or not

406
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:40,020
anybody would actually follow those
rules question the way that it works is

407
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,800
that they maintain a database and then
the idea is that they want manufacturers

408
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,780
to put fences around those points and
that's a good point I don't know that

409
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,390
that's been raised I don't know I don't
know what their validation but certainly

410
00:41:54,390 --> 00:42:00,910
it seems like someone could do that just
put the neighbors you know there's a

411
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:06,300
Facebook page called the law of drones
may want to follow her on Facebook might

412
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:13,990
have something to do with me and as I
leave time for questions I do wanna show

413
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:33,790
1 more video that I would just let role
was wrong and I will take your questions

414
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:47,460
for the next six minutes seven minutes
that's short so he asked about

415
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,089
commercial use for guarding people
posting videos to YouTube

416
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:57,700
there's a guy who lived in the guy who
lived in Florida who was posting videos

417
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,529
on YouTube and his YouTube account with
monetized so the FAA sent him an

418
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:06,239
endorsement letter and asked him to take
down the videos even though he hadn't

419
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,249
actually reached the level where he had
gotten any money from Google cuz they

420
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:13,999
only send you money after you reach like
$100 and he had like 14 cents or

421
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:21,589
something like that but the FAA sort of
backed away from that and it said that

422
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:26,289
was sort of investigator off on his own
so then they haven't been going after

423
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:45,089
people since that incident I haven't
seen any administrative agencies like to

424
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:49,779
exert the full extent of their power so
if you go to the FAA right now they will

425
00:43:49,779 --> 00:44:07,000
tell you they control the airspace to
the ground in other words flying

426
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:18,850
buying something like this this is a
drone doesn't have a camera fits in the

427
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:23,060
palm of your hand when I saw a
controller for it finds her few minutes

428
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,340
actually really difficult to fly because
the so light and these propellers

429
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:31,430
produced so much thrust that's really
difficult to control but if you're

430
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:35,270
flying something like this in your
backyard the FAA would say they can't do

431
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,080
anything about it but they would say
they have jurisdiction over it

432
00:44:38,080 --> 00:45:02,590
yes aircraft and therefore that they
can't control it but they don't have the

433
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:08,810
authority to regulate it but anything
that flies they could conclude again

434
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,320
they're not going to go after people
what people are doing in their backyard

435
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:19,950
probably but they claim they have the
authority to do this

436
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:33,530
this is that the one where he went right
through the question he asked about a

437
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:40,089
main insurance there are a couple places
that will give insurance to drones but

438
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:45,300
generally those insurance what to do
with ensuring the drone itself some some

439
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,070
people have doing that ensuring drones
the other issue would be like liability

440
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:56,210
insurance and it's it's it's just it's a
nation industry the insurance industry

441
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:06,470
for drugs they might be surprised

442
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:12,960
ok yeah the question would be then
Michael my question because they don't

443
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,770
know about it would be whether it covers
commercial uses which it may not right

444
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,869
right so if your commercial user

445
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:25,030
you know you probably won't have that
liability insurance is there anybody

446
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:29,819
who's actually gonna give it to you if
you just search for like drone crashes

447
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,380
you can try and stuff like this all over
the internet it's great

448
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:42,380
yes

449
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:58,050
yes so balloon like regulations and then
so you have to balloon launches like

450
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:03,290
high altitudes up to 800,000 sheets for
the thing I think you have to notify the

451
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:10,620
FAA but there's not a lot of other
regulation of and no I launches like

452
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:17,040
several hundred weather balloons a day
into the never as far as I know they've

453
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,400
never had any incidents with aircraft
issues so those are generally not an

454
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,650
issue but I think to notify the FAA
about it

455
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:44,390
other questions yes I have a link that
allows me to transmit waypoints also

456
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:49,960
have a video transmitter so I have like
a little 7 inch monitor so I can see

457
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:55,560
with the camera seeing what I'm flying
DJI the company that makes these are the

458
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,520
most popular sort of drugs that are out
there are taken from the Apple approach

459
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,220
they put out they put out this which is
the version 2 and then they let people

460
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,190
kind of hack away on it and then they
take all those things that they liked

461
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:11,250
and they integrate that into the next
version so they have that sort of Apple

462
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:17,370
marketing approach

463
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:21,250
first flight ever

464
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:34,500
yes

465
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:43,950
code the code allows you to put it it's
hard to say it depends on is it had

466
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:49,510
right adjacent to your house is it you
know sort of in the backyard I think you

467
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:54,750
have issues as long as people aren't
flying right by the tower I think you

468
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:59,300
have it you have issues making a good
claim that someone was for example trust

469
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,480
or something like that but I don't know
that it's been tried someone's gonna

470
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:21,880
have to try it again these and that's a
good idea

471
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:32,670
these are all issues that haven't been
litigated in the courts take off

472
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:40,730
and you documented everything you know
we know these are things that have to be

473
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:45,329
worked out in the courts and that's
where they're going to end up at least

474
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:49,970
from the hobbyist community I think we
want the least amount of regulation the

475
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,420
other interesting thing is you have
people who fly model aircraft have been

476
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:59,109
doing it for forty fifty years and
they're not so they want they don't

477
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:02,470
really want to be part of the drunk
community so there's a little bit at two

478
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:13,630
one more question there are there was a
case a month or two ago work I put a

479
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:19,000
handgun on its own and he was obviously
an area that control it was only a few

480
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,500
feet off the ground but he was firing it
I've also seen like people put roman

481
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,849
candles on drones the stuff like that
but the the night that handgun was the

482
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:31,290
only one I've seen so far and i know
that maybe the FAA or somebody was

483
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,480
looking into it but I don't know that it
went any further than that but people

484
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,510
are doing it that you can think it's
someone's probably doing it

485
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,730
thank you everybody I appreciate
