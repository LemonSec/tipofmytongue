1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
alright so I guess we'll have to use a
wonderful evening come on there things

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:25,789
over with the court it's not even going
to get that alright so welcome to our

3
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:39,879
talk so we get high on the labor so I've
never presented their become before so I

4
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,140
figured introductions were in order this
is me

5
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,390
administrator at Lafayette College also
half of the partnership which is the

6
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,789
other guys hosting mosul father hacker
tinker jeepers builder beer drinker is

7
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,410
why I'm here not really for the
conference and other things

8
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:06,280
jack of all trades I know a lot of a
little bit of a lot of things so then

9
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,900
there's hi my name is rich I made a stop
in your life he acknowledged I also

10
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,400
teach Arduino and nothing to community
college at the comp lab also a technical

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,659
writing consultant and I'm recovering
physicist a total mess up their means I

12
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:27,409
am also a father I maker I have quite
the collection of tools that continues

13
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,740
to grow

14
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,500
and I'm always looking to learn stuff
which is why I'm here and yes the

15
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,110
beer-drinking sort of goes without
saying at this point so are you guys

16
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:45,070
here is that is the good question so we
built something cool and you didn't or

17
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,390
maybe you did I don't know we're
surrounded by a lot of townspeople here

18
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,450
I didn't want to offend anybody what the
heck did we build well data center in a

19
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,759
hat is the best way I can describe it
why would somebody do that well because

20
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:07,539
because because we're hackers because it
sounded like it would be hard to do and

21
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:11,519
that's the sort of thing that I liked it
because it sounds like it'd be fun

22
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:18,220
because it'd be hard to do and well this
is the last year when the hack your

23
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,190
derby competition thing about this is
exactly what we did mission and what we

24
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:28,150
saw at the conference was not quite that
but with wings terms with lights we

25
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,260
didn't see any interviews with computer
inside so we decided to to build that

26
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,799
then we found out the competition wasn't
on this year so that really well

27
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:45,570
whatever little disappointed there so
get on with it so the basics what what's

28
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,690
the idea here we we had to figure out
this is basically a list of what we had

29
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,160
to figure out to try to put a datacenter
in hat form factor obviously going to

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,810
fit inside of hat just sort of a
challenge we have to figure out how to

31
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,180
let people connect to it and I'll get
back to that in a moment that you'll

32
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,680
wonder why you need to connect my head

33
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,209
power obviously these things need to run
on our heads self-contained for at least

34
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:13,130
you know most of the day at the
conference we need to figure out what

35
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,760
we're going to put how we're gonna wear
it all day you know has to be

36
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,110
comfortable enough that it's not going
to give us headaches

37
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:25,880
brain cancer and then platform you know
we need to figure out what sort of

38
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:32,050
compute we can put inside of a hat it's
going to be viable need to figure out

39
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:38,050
flags because there's actually CTF in
here it's not just you know an access

40
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,730
point that you guys can try to get get
into

41
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,670
to figure out how to get scores to our
external scoreboard which exists here

42
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,270
about that later too and we wanted to
display on the side to do something with

43
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,890
the original thought was that that's
where the score would be but that didn't

44
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,570
look realistic once we started looking
at displays it so we ended up with such

45
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:06,660
so for form factor we decided to go with
a Raspberry Pi a-plus mainly because

46
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,790
they're tiny they don't take a lot of
power they're not very expenses and well

47
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,120
I can run Linux on it so that's perfect
I'm at home there we can power it over

48
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,560
USB which just about every battery you
can buy on the market has the ability to

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,520
plug into a USB every portable battery
anyway and we can plug in USB

50
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,070
peripherals so obviously the thing
needed wireless so we thought what

51
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,979
better way to connect wireless than just
get a wireless adapter and plug it

52
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:42,140
raining so activity we decided to go
with an hour link USB wifi adapter

53
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,610
mainly because that was what

54
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,650
recommended for compatibility with raspy
in and went through with the Raspberry

55
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,710
Pi a done using host ATT to stand up and
access point and of course all the

56
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,680
goodies that go along with along with
that each EP server and whatnot so after

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,620
rich

58
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,389
ok so we had two goals knowing that it
was Derby Conn and they will be getting

59
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,240
up at 8 a.m. and going to sleep maybe at
like 3 a.m. we need like 16 hours of run

60
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,919
time of course were unaware that the
entire time you need to be lightweight

61
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,639
because once again referring to the
entire time and not cook our heads same

62
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,240
reason and we need to be returned within
six hours because when you getting up

63
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,710
and going down at 345 there's not a heck
of a lot of recharge time so what did we

64
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,310
end up with we actually ended up doing
better than we had been trying for when

65
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,490
we when we actually measured the current
draw of our entire stack display wi-fi

66
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,120
adapter Raspberry Pi we're gaining three
hundred million straw was like wow it's

67
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,330
thought and we took a twenty thousand
million power advertised battery in

68
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,919
there that you like dollar and empower
nowadays in these batteries like this is

69
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:10,560
$19 battery of Amazon is great and we're
getting approaching 30 our time so which

70
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,669
is just a little bit which is good
because actually doesn't charge for a

71
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:20,160
fast and cheap battery so even in six
hours we didn't get back everything that

72
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,960
we had used the previous 16 so it's a
good thing we're happy have to sort of

73
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:32,349
buffer of extra time in there ok so
returning comfort there's there is some

74
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:37,419
room in a derby but you're putting
everything up on top so it's so you got

75
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,340
this battery sort of floating around on
top of your head and it's kind of heavy

76
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,030
so the center masses you know sort of up
there so that's that's a little

77
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,530
different there's no room for fancy
mounting we had this is a gorgeous

78
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,800
design for the structured like we got
this demo plastic we ship around the

79
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,040
battery and you stand off by a National
Harbor going where's my second ago

80
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:04,840
that's not gonna work so we had to do
all the things or I had all the things

81
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,930
his looks beautiful inside mine just
like everything is clubbed in there and

82
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:14,970
it's mostly secure and we're trying to
avoid sort of you know into yet where do

83
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,710
I get really good bond with your hot
glue or after a couple days of wearing

84
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,690
it to be glad to start to like this fall
of your hand better is losing balancing

85
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,010
my head now it's great but you know

86
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,640
suspenders rate so there's also actually
a fishing line trust in there in case

87
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,030
the hot glue let's go and you know he
actually didn't lose battery and we did

88
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,280
the same worries about ended wire ring
in the top and by chance to snap right

89
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,250
in there on his hat so that's like
snapped in and efficient fishing line

90
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:51,470
right as a secondary safety net ya
literacy so we turn to avoid walking

91
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,380
around all day with a battery just
sitting on your head because that you

92
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:04,930
get addict alright so platform we won't
rest easy because we wanted to run

93
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,430
doctor on top of it so that we could
contain her eyes all of our flags which

94
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,720
doctor on Raspberry Pi is something I
didn't know anyone had ever done before

95
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,480
I didn't even consider it when I first
started this and then I just had this

96
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,880
idea what I was trying to figure out how
to put services on my host because I

97
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,100
only have one host this isn't a CTF for
a better record servers I have one host

98
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,510
to deal with I needed some way to
protect all those services from anybody

99
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,510
who wanted to try to actually be
malicious and maybe break out of the

100
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,050
service or whatnot after all an opening
this up for you guys to try to break

101
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:43,030
into the system in i feel like im good
at my job I'm not that good

102
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,570
nobody is that good to walk into a
conference full of what 2000 hackers

103
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,400
with with your services running directly
on your host and then expect that no

104
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,870
one's going to be able to break out of
that and just destroy your stuff so dr.

105
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,480
Jeanne container arises all the services
I've got one service for dr. container

106
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,760
if you were to say breakout of Apache
you would be inside of the container

107
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,860
which sure if you're smart enough you
could probably find a way to break out

108
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,530
of that too but it's another layer of
defense and that's that's what I was

109
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,150
going for

110
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:21,280
so flags what a CTF without flags so we
put the flags and side of dr. containers

111
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:30,350
each flag will give you code compare
this to if you were to open up a soda

112
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,940
bottle and get a code under the cap
exact same scenario except it's coming

113
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,840
from my Derby after you get the code you
take it and enter it in the scoreboard

114
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,970
which is the scoreboard so we decided to
host it on Red Hat's OpenShift online

115
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,870
because hey that's also based on
containers and we have a team doing I

116
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,690
also want to try out the service because
it's something we've been considering

117
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,720
for a while at the college and that's
you know I think it is a great way to

118
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,730
test my test my feet in this and dr as
well because talk or something if

119
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,050
interested in quite interesting for a
while so the codes you you get a code

120
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,930
you write it down to take a picture of
it whatever you want to do then at your

121
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,690
convenience you go and connect to the
scoreboard and you put in your code and

122
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,970
your name and then you end up on the
scoreboard scores are tallied based on

123
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:24,400
values that we said earlier which so
what they already own a few different

124
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,230
slides the OED we used first of all we
use in OED rather than an LCD because

125
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,240
he's about a third of the power and we
were really concerned about runtime

126
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,300
there so it's a 16 back to character led
from Adafruit were using a parallel

127
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,660
interface can actually in theory be
wired up in different ways to use

128
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,340
different phases like SBI will get to
the practicalities of that

129
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:54,280
in a couple slides now it one of the
stuff that was difficult to do as if

130
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,430
this wasn't difficult to begin with so
doctor itself i mean again like I said

131
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,900
there wasn't just a package that I could
just go and say hey rest being unbeaten

132
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,090
doctor I'm used to the Red Hat world
works quickly uninstall to get just

133
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:13,060
about any software that I want I am
definitely familiar with the world of

134
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,650
building software from source Linux
since 1996 or so before packages were

135
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:25,020
really the way that most software was
was was distributed so anyway I found a

136
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,430
source package that someone had already
compiled 22 modified to run against

137
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,210
lesbians Weezy I basically followed the
directions and it was pretty simple

138
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,050
there were a few little tricks and jumps
and I intend to document that little

139
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,160
better we'll be releasing most of the
details about exactly how all this stuff

140
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,250
worked in a blog entry later if you
follow our Twitter handle at the Derby

141
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,230
on at their wits up and ready it might
be a week or two after the conference is

142
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:59,920
over time to read it so the other big
issue here so when I first thought of

143
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,210
this the the the the design process for
this thing went through a number of

144
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,460
iterations originally I thought that
instead of collecting clothes and

145
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,720
putting them into the scoreboard they're
actually you would trigger something and

146
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,960
it would report to the scoreboard will
that becomes problematic because

147
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,220
scoreboards not on hat you have to be
able to get to the Internet to get to

148
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,720
the scoreboard how I was gonna do that
in a conference where wireless signal

149
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,790
and everything are untrustworthy at best
and unusable sometime was was sort of a

150
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,160
problem that and how would I get you
guys into the habit have to run to

151
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,780
wireless adapter power draw which means
I have to try to keep the two adapters

152
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,650
you know in a state where their usable
and it just seemed like a whole lot of

153
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,630
effort so instead we went we went with
the code model that are described

154
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,480
earlier

155
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:04,019
and the oh my freaking led yeah so power
consumption aside we do you see led to

156
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,610
be no led actually wanted he paper but
that was confined anything you can

157
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,810
decide if anyone knows a good supplier
for ePaper screens by I'm at some

158
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,500
thought on Twitter please just treat me
and tell me where to get that stuff for

159
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:23,290
next year will be great so old lady ok
so as with a lot of components that are

160
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,480
able to talk over 200 buses the way to
switch between the protocol that

161
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,089
communicates on it a little tiny service
marks on the back and you decide to them

162
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,380
and move them to a different location
and southern back on and we had the data

163
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,709
she led and I thought it was SPI because
driving an SPI display from a pie is

164
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:45,240
actually pretty well documented thing
that people do YouTube videos on its

165
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:54,149
great and even though he has the same 16
pins as a CD it's not exactly the same

166
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,380
there's obviously a back way on an old
lady but there's also this thing called

167
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,410
wait while it's busy and LCD just
doesn't have you just send commands I

168
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,160
didn't it does it he says he said we can
but tough and busy I'm not ignoring you

169
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:16,190
now so you need a good library and there
weren't any good libraries out there for

170
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:24,920
parallel OLEDB connection to Raspberry
Pi so far at all and it doesn't work

171
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,940
ok around some guy had this German
website where he had it all working

172
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,930
today and he says here's how I did it
and what he described didn't match the

173
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,079
photos that he posted he had like the
resistors mood all weird places that

174
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,180
didn't match those on the datasheet like
this doesn't work put it back in

175
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,370
parallel we find this some guy who wrote
the library and hadn't updated on this

176
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:49,120
get home in like two years and it was
like I'm not a big guy but he denied it

177
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:58,279
this is Danny so we did all that and
we've had a great courage great price on

178
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:06,860
call will be there he just said the
datasheet library so I decided

179
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,770
everything that I had moved around put
back to parallel mode and used calls

180
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,900
library and now we've got like pac-man
running cross I getting letters and

181
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:22,490
everything in its fabulous so thanks
girl so what do we display so one thing

182
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,150
I forgot to mention the talk of the
beginning to talk if you connect to my

183
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:33,550
Derby and there's an IP address of 10420
13 where a website runs the slides for

184
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,529
the presentation have been hosted on the
Derby during this during the

185
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:41,200
presentation if you want to slide you
can get them now I think I do something

186
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,830
fun since I'm standing here presenting
with a remotely accessible data center

187
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:52,690
so why did we want to display so putting
this putting all this inside of a hat

188
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,589
without an external display nobody would
see it they would just say look you get

189
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:01,279
a derby on your become well to
understand a little bit so we thought

190
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,930
the display would be perfect way to do
that in the course built in so that

191
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,959
there's there's cases where a one of the
flags you can actually write a message

192
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,490
to the display reform as long as its 16
characters or less I realized I was

193
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,640
opening myself up to a lot of
embarrassment by letting the entire con

194
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,839
control the display it seems like only
two people have gotten into it and they

195
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,480
happen to be friends of ours so I guess
not as many people were interested as we

196
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,070
as we hope

197
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,790
they think it displays and this is more
or less just for fodder for things to

198
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,810
display while nobody has actually
claimed control of the Derby whenever

199
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,910
somebody joins the you know their their
their mobile device

200
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,280
it'll display the hostname the joint
know that happened at all while talking

201
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,210
or not but you may have seen that happen
and then of course there's just this

202
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,290
advertise loop that if nothing else is
happening you'll see that going right

203
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,930
now displays a couple of messages that
have sort of funny tidbits from previous

204
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,510
cons where to find our scoreboard what
our Twitter handles are things like that

205
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:13,550
what the SSID is to join the so it's
important as well so the CTF itself so

206
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:22,449
what does it consist of two derbies SSID
about 587 possible points I really

207
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,680
didn't know how to judge the point so I
just sort of threw things in there is as

208
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,420
I thought the challenge was each had a
slightly different though they run

209
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,550
similar services so you can't just get
through one of them and then do the same

210
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,290
thing on the other and get twice the
points there's actually someone reaches

211
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,770
that are a little more complicated than
mine

212
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,690
there's a really interesting online at
all go into if we have time at the end

213
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:52,990
of the end of the talk so the CTF
consists of on on my nerves got four

214
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:58,460
containers on his own history so there's
a Samba share as an SSH server there's a

215
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:07,180
web server and there's a circle mud over
the responsible so a lot of my a lot of

216
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,780
what got me into the idea industry was
in my younger days I was a big fan

217
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,800
a lot of margin was not so this is one
of the first containers I tried to build

218
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,020
a sort of a proof of concept what can I
put in container and I am on inside of

219
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,300
the container and after I built and I
thought what the hell off the road onto

220
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,710
the Derby and maybe somebody will find
it and have fun I later worked it into

221
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:35,200
the CTF you can actually social engineer
but that runs around in circles

222
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:45,679
so coaching scoreboard I sort of already
talked on this here's a freebie quick

223
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:53,350
take a picture these these are the codes
look like I decided to do things in a

224
00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:01,049
way that would prevent code reuse from
you know say Keith here got a clue dude

225
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:04,039
and he's on the scoreboard trying to
enter it and someone just looks over

226
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:08,909
shoulder and grabs code and then tries
to claim the same flight Keith did it

227
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:13,330
work once keith has entered it this code
is no longer valid this code is reusable

228
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,620
because it's in the slide and obviously
I can't have as many slides there are

229
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,269
people in the room here so basically
that the first half of the code

230
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,769
identifies what case you've passed and
that's what we figure out how many

231
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:29,000
points to give you the second half of
the code is random we generated several

232
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,580
thousand random goes it in half but
Derby and then put all the codes up on

233
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,559
the scoreboard whenever whenever the
Derby gives you a code it then delete it

234
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,360
from its database and whatever you claim
a code on the scoreboard it delete it

235
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,130
from its databases should never be a
case where two people have received the

236
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:51,230
same code unless the special code like
this one or the other that static so now

237
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,929
to others and sorry you had you had one
with the scoreboard looks like and how

238
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,769
are you can see it when the back
basically our our web development team

239
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,580
at the college we we tap their resources
to build these things because I can I

240
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,320
could have written a scoreboard it
would've been ugly I'm not a web

241
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,380
developer so this is again it's it's all
it's all based on a framework called

242
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,070
Silex uses twiggy this is what our web
guys were trying to learn so they use

243
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,260
that as a reason to get themselves into
this this new templating system whatever

244
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:32,820
it looks nice but it's also on the
scoreboard there's the rules and

245
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,350
the project is about whatever alright so
we're at the hands of the slides I

246
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,279
wanted to say a couple of thank yous
first of all let me acknowledge who we

247
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,789
will work for were kind enough to pay
for all of the components give us time

248
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:50,179
to work on these things because they
thought it was a neat project and you

249
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:53,990
know of course the school's name out
there a little bit if you want to do

250
00:20:53,990 --> 00:21:01,370
cool things come to Lafayette College so
charles in 10 there are web guys they're

251
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,259
the ones that are responsible for
building that scoreboard 1002 but then

252
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:06,970
he went on vacation and there were some
things that need to be changed so

253
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,289
Charles finished it up for us

254
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:11,070
charles is also here but he didn't come
to the talk because we're not important

255
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:20,440
enough to him of course who is our our
library and Keith right here was kind

256
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,590
enough to to go through and and sort of
beta tests a little flags and let us

257
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,529
know if we were completely crazy and
that these things were going to be just

258
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:30,990
decimated or if it was even funded to
participate you gave us some some great

259
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:37,639
feedback and most of all thanks to Derby
Conn and 4% this and thanks to all of

260
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:41,460
you for showing up to our talk that's
just awesome that you that you showed up

261
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,600
especially this early on a Sunday after
all the partying and that's it here so

262
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,970
you get a hold of us this is part of
corals demo loop we thought it was

263
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:58,330
perfect for the last light in the
presentation so I did wonder if if you

264
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,960
guys want to stick around and hear about
any of the the more interesting flags we

265
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,580
can meet the hall and chatter or I can I
can answer questions or whatever you

266
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,039
want

267
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:12,600
yes so I guess we'll do questions first
anybody have any questions about

268
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,019
anything in this frigid think yes I was
actually thinking about this I was

269
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:23,250
running my spreadsheet but then as these
things go there was a ton of parts we

270
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:29,639
bought that we didn't even use don't
tell us so we bought this thermoplastic

271
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:34,409
that we're going to build this cool
framework to build you know to put the

272
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:37,470
Derby to put inside the Derby that
helped the battery in the pie and the

273
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:37,730
law

274
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,690
USB hope it's in there and it just went
we just you know we had all these great

275
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,790
plans oh yeah there's like this awesome
laser cutter at the college we're going

276
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,220
to use that it'll cut it perfect then
we'll just heated up and yet none of it

277
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,990
would fit the the the extra quarter-inch
that it did it added talking to the to

278
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,140
the battery was just too much we
couldn't fit it so in the end the stuff

279
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,240
and actually ended up in the Derby
probably talking between 200 250 that's

280
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,000
including the Derby all the components
the cheap little battery will keep the

281
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,390
battery will be bought

282
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,130
yes so you can build it yourself and
honestly you could might be a bit

283
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,130
cheaper without the constraints of
trying to put it inside of a hat so if

284
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,480
you were just trying to build it as like
a thing to say to your house or thing to

285
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,230
carry around in a bag or something a
little cheaper

286
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:36,010
constrained as we were so yeah I mean
the pie was 30 bucks the only team was

287
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:41,770
30 bucks and I don't think any other any
other component exceeded $30 ticket

288
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:47,510
items yeah yeah and then you know
misleads cables and whatnot

289
00:23:47,510 --> 00:24:00,120
it's not expensive anything else know
the questions so there's there's not a

290
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:12,650
picture taken off and show you guys be
up to come up and see it on its Twitter

291
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,960
on Twitter a while back I believe we
post a picture of the inside of the

292
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,090
attack which you can show you here

293
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:26,810
goal huge look he's looking thing this
is the back of the display and here's

294
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:32,240
the Raspberry Pi over inside here and
then above the battery there's this we

295
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,560
bought a cheap USB hope that was meant
for like you know plug into your laptop

296
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,460
or whatever the key was it's powered so
what we wanted to do was get steady

297
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,380
power to the wifi adapter because we had
read that some people had issues with

298
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,330
the power supply coming from the pie and
we last thing we wanted was for the wifi

299
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,590
adapter do not have enough power because
we had no idea how many people were

300
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:57,350
gonna get this thing and then I set up
the appt with 65,000 IP leases because I

301
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:02,720
had no idea what you guys are going to
do it so twenty lately but that little

302
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,420
adapter little USB hub and then we just
pulled the case off of it and it's like

303
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,870
the size of a stick of gum with some USB
port stuck to the top of it so that's

304
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,050
above the battery in this this little
dome shape on top of the hat that's

305
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:19,040
where that fit and that's where the wifi
that there is so yeah and for the record

306
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,900
the soldering on the actual USB to cheap
USB might as well have been stuck on

307
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:32,030
with guns as well we had to redo that
was pulling itself out so as far as some

308
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:37,110
of the the the flags on most proud of
the circle that mean that's that's cool

309
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:41,760
you you can actually there there's
basically this user that let the let you

310
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,790
get into the SSH container you get the
figure out the password so I left on the

311
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:52,140
Samba share this.com around the day you
could theoretically figure out a profile

312
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,300
of the sky and try to build his password
but the easy way as you go into the

313
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,840
modern you ask him there's a there's a
one-in-three chance he'll actually give

314
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,120
you a password and if he if if if he
doesn't get he was pastor he gets

315
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,830
freaked out and runs away

316
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,510
so that there was a fun when I thought
it was fun to build and I don't know how

317
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,620
many of you actually intend to actually
try to break into the hat after this

318
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,500
talk but the conference is almost over I
don't mind giving away some of the

319
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:25,519
secrets is also where we used one of the
codes built a QR code on the fly it was

320
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,179
kind of a last minute addition which has
one hidden in an image somewhere that's

321
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:39,929
that's on his son Bashar things to be to
the website so yeah if you get a chance

322
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:43,220
and you're in range of us for long
enough connect and just look at the

323
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,830
web-sites that rich made i mean that the
land is the same as for what we just

324
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,100
basically ripped it made its static and
putting static HTML content because you

325
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,029
have something in there to make it look
like a website otherwise it was just

326
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:59,440
like hey here's a website user code and
that was kinda do so so yet rich put in

327
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,409
a whole bunch of dummy content about
this corporation called Derby Corp and

328
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:06,679
about how they make data centers in hats
and how they feel that they're more

329
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,289
secure because they're always on the
move and you know wifi has a limited

330
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:14,539
range so you don't need to worry about
firewall doesn't want not just move at a

331
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:20,779
range of fun it's it's it's a really
really really fun read if you want

332
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:29,399
something to occupy a little bit of time
so oh yeah yeah you can on the beta site

333
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:35,450
so that was the idea these these were
two sites in a corporation the opposite

334
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,860
in the beta site that's that's where we
got the SSI DS there's a there's a look

335
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,830
on my son Bashar there's a bunch of like
a chore documentation one of them is

336
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,190
this letter from their network engineer
talking about how he's going to build

337
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,970
this ultra secure network between the
two derbies and he's gonna get them and

338
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,299
then he's going to use a certain
protocol that I'm not going to tell you

339
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,510
because it's funny you're on your own

340
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,100
to get data in between the two the two
derbies which doesn't exist

341
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,570
it's it's pretty hilarious though I
think regarding the boy band that was

342
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,630
not just a fever dream of mine when we
took the pictures and we will stand

343
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,600
staring off into space that looks like
an album cover from a boy then we need

344
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,620
to do to show up somewhere so but
apparently if you read the sights on the

345
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:27,299
two had stairs there seems to be some
friction at Derby Corp so the worldwide

346
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:31,360
headquarters at the record saying you
know they are the most brilliant minds

347
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,970
there and of course dean of the folks to
be certain element beta everything

348
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:41,250
outsourcing them right so you know
that's going on there because we'll see

349
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:45,320
what happens if they get the next
products out project Lincoln a cluster

350
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,860
in a stovepipe

351
00:28:48,860 --> 00:29:06,500
time around with Mac OS trying to get
the Derby wireless but I think it will

352
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,460
spend some time that in the lobby or we
can just talk in the hallway if anybody

353
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,169
has any more questions thank you very
much for coming to talk
