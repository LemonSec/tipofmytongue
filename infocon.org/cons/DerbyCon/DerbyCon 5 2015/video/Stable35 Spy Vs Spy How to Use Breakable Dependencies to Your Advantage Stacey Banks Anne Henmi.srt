1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,540
ok yeah alright this is last table
talking tonight we're going to talk

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,590
about how to use breakable dependencies
for managed so it will be a stable talk

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:22,550
brought to you by too unstable people we
know you love us as usual standard

4
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,680
disclaimers apply

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:38,270
represent our work yeah this is just our
incentives yeah that's ok I'm Stacy

6
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,079
banks so I'm going to be talking about
the red team approach my background is

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:52,059
heavily Unix Linux based policy and
telling people how they're just wrong

8
00:00:52,059 --> 00:01:31,630
and of course you know a girl and I'm
and honey I'm representing the blue team

9
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,700
I have a lot of experience complete team
stuff inside environments operations

10
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:45,060
product security educational so

11
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:58,420
talk about library reuse so it's a good
thing right

12
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,310
using libraries however what's not so
good about him you have increased attack

13
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,929
surface and you have no clue what so
labor ears include things like open

14
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,489
source software to burn a lot of
examples of that commercial libraries

15
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,630
are not just open source and also
primarily internal versus external

16
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:30,849
pressure miss you guys are and security
for those stuck around me to that man

17
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:36,780
database level during the fund support
stuff that we don't want to do thank you

18
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,970
very much thank you but also looking at
this this is this is the difference in

19
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,420
approach between going slow on attack
taking the red team outside approach

20
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:57,440
where you can either have full knowledge
due to being part of it having a

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,790
complete open inside into it or acting
as an actual attackers think what you

22
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,519
can find on your own during your open
source and tell during a network spans

23
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:13,130
and see just what role as hacker would
actually get those actually that tends

24
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,230
to be better since it gives you a full
sense but

25
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,360
not many places actually like red
teaming because they don't want their

26
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,349
ship broke so it tends to be more of a
blue team with the code don't mess up

27
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:39,470
anything so you can balance that
everybody need pushing management to do

28
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:48,760
red team that's where the fun that so
you guys know talked about the actual

29
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,849
history the lovely libraries are they
use well we know things when we don't

30
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:58,299
know the attack services and
vulnerabilities come out they do things

31
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,769
like a break the internet so everybody
remembers her plead and prove that you

32
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:14,569
see the heads going yeah I don't remind
me I don't remember that and then Bosch

33
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:29,750
oh my god literally going to do about
that yet again another thing here we go

34
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,289
more stuff affecting the people but we
really should have vulnerabilities this

35
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:41,000
should strictly be you know commercial
people but that's also an impact to its

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,979
not just open source right by other
libraries there were something that be

37
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,229
safe for instance

38
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,470
oh that's been back toward by the feds
those people aren't surprised by that

39
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,550
but still it's it's a backdoor in its
attack service into your software or

40
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,660
your network much like the proposed an
exception because we all know you have

41
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,970
they know what they're doing

42
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,600
remembers the OMB attack

43
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:22,170
it's not my fault no so we're gonna pick
on OpenSSL because everybody yeah

44
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,070
everybody loves OpenSSL it's it's
everybody's favorite open source library

45
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,380
because its security all sorts of
encrypted transactions for money banking

46
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,930
and its purchases

47
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,400
password so nobody actually added to the
code actually really went through in

48
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,020
like checked it major did you know
either before people came out before

49
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,040
before her plea came out it's still just
had numerous health benefits people just

50
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,650
horribly very right well it still having
problems so now at least libri SSH SSL

51
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,780
is coming out with with the OpenBSD guys
but still it's nobody's going to OpenSSL

52
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,740
right now and stopping gripping their
traffic and something that's just a test

53
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:13,900
so it's always a balance and much like
OpenSSL there's still been continued

54
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,500
get more vulnerabilities that are out
there beyond just the huge branded ones

55
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,110
that we've had so far and they're not
alone

56
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,760
they've just gotten the most news
nothing like a boner ability with its

57
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:32,260
own website yes and please whoever is
branding them stop letting your

58
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:43,670
five-year-old name level

59
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:53,660
what happens when you have the ability
in your library what you do and you can

60
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,220
take some more and then eventually come
down over the panic ok now what

61
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,640
let's look and see what's affected right
let's see if we actually use the code

62
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,680
code accessible how are actually you
know using the library how were impacted

63
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,480
before you know after the panic settles
the other thing you have to do you have

64
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,660
to think of a correct way to respond to
the public because everybody wants to

65
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,130
fix the vulnerability right near the end
of the day after it came out have you

66
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,040
fixed it was released a patch up so no
fix it but you have to have a proper

67
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,230
response for legal and things like that

68
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:33,610
procedure it's a necessary evil yeah I
know and just as guidelines for

69
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,320
everything

70
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:48,560
do it just do it so from a red team
perspective however when you gonna do

71
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:57,200
when it comes along with it i mean
you're gonna go after them to your gonna

72
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,670
take it because you know what dennis is
gonna be freakin flower

73
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:09,280
yeah we have an opportunity that could
span weeks depending on who exactly the

74
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,060
vendor is that has the issue and how in
denial they are and going on so

75
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,540
researchers so they're within their time
doing that we can leverage it as an

76
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,860
attack vector ya go there

77
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:28,270
utilize what researcher is looking to
add more towards injection really get in

78
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:34,190
here already I'm really has an advantage
because the team you just gotta get on

79
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:51,500
what you're at the mercy I'm at the
mercy of you so much so so after the

80
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,290
panic

81
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:59,890
Cincinnati you run your incident
response rate shelter after work so you

82
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,480
going to response mode rate you and your
instant response boat so while you're in

83
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,450
response but what do you do you write
your security now CBS escorts to make

84
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,620
sure everybody knows very the
vulnerability and really hope it's not

85
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,460
an easy task easy to break

86
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,080
remote exploit doesn't require a hope
it's not one of those usually somewhere

87
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,820
in the middle and then you go into this
is on particular product side website

88
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,770
you want to get things patched as much
as you can but you wanna make sure your

89
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,899
legal basis do

90
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:45,769
they're worrying and attempting to get
their vendors to respond well patch

91
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:52,199
management is being attempted you want
to go out there and yeah I swear this

92
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:59,959
works too and real-life such a situation
you know we should be doing regular red

93
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,850
team against our networks are you should
be attempting to do these exploits when

94
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,240
they come out to see how are you better
know whether this has actually been

95
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,290
patched if your attempts if you're
trying to do something internally while

96
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,420
you're waiting for your vendor to
finally resolve the issue is something

97
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,300
internally so have the red team's go out
there do they're scanning the attack

98
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:34,819
vectors because honestly it's gonna be
awhile ya gonna have over here paintings

99
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:46,379
and we have plenty of networks to play
with yes so once everything's pat pat

100
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:52,079
we're safe know we have built in
libraries are included with other

101
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,589
products director other applications and
in this case they don't usually a parade

102
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:03,879
their libraries with every rap so a lot
of ways the rivets oh yeah you still

103
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,600
have to go back and review and if it's a
previous Rev know you have the courage

104
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,470
exploit that's possibly got its own
website you might have other things you

105
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,949
have to fix as well so that still needs
reviewing testing inventory what had

106
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:19,639
this running that app what is running
that other products that for example

107
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:26,019
OpenSSL they don't necessarily use the
library on your computer so we didn't

108
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,199
link to a while ago here it's compiled
off somewhere else it's already in the

109
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:34,019
package so you know I think you know

110
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,389
ok well that's it's a lot of things you
know about you being a major web server

111
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:41,939
would be impacted by that so

112
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:57,439
but it was great I mean it's so easy for
red team if you are if you have a

113
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:03,329
product that they've internalize they
haven't included in theirs and they have

114
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:06,819
to update their software so they're not
just running off at the latest greatest

115
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:12,089
on your you know hopefully regularly
patch system especially at work

116
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:18,209
production this energy is an another
factor that is gonna stick around after

117
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:21,939
you have patched the actual operating
system and you're feeling all nice and

118
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:25,609
safe and sound in your little you know
blue team world and especially

119
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:37,470
management but management and general oh
yes check catches replied check ok we

120
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:46,629
bought the shit out ya know you have no
we can do if those vendors have not

121
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:51,649
updated their particular software and it
can be worse because you can we all know

122
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:58,200
vendors

123
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:08,750
yes so yeah it's just it takes to do it
well that's how many places actually

124
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,700
bother with doing you know maintaining a
whole software image they look

125
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,420
third-party applications that are
included so that they know oh yeah this

126
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,830
one isn't running the supplied by West
base so we definitely need to make sure

127
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,750
that we're getting an update from them
if they haven't done anything out and in

128
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:34,010
the meantime we should probably do some
proactive work most places don't again

129
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,800
making it really easy and even those who
do sometimes they've got so much work

130
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,150
that they're backlogged in their
soldiers there's companies out there try

131
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:51,960
to keep up with all these they do an ok
job the only company that really does

132
00:13:51,960 --> 00:14:06,360
especially for all right you've tried to
patch everything and you realize you're

133
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,230
in a panic but you know what

134
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,820
ok we patched everything we still have
vendors not doing so this is Ben out the

135
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,510
exploits been out long enough now and
the script kiddies are so you need to

136
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:24,250
have to look at things like network
blocking calling me land ports whatever

137
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,410
you need to do to configure it and turn
it off and find a way to stop the

138
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,330
traffic either through configuration
files

139
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,310
this is all while you're waiting for a
vendor response you're like ok already

140
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,860
get it to me this is silly you guys noon
and then catching that when it comes out

141
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,560
so there's enough companies out there
who like you to patch every day you know

142
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:56,410
we always get like I'm to slash you know
that exploit every other yeah you don't

143
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,540
need those now you're set

144
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:15,180
tricking users need to educate users to
we need to tell them hey guys so I know

145
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,390
as it becomes more popular there's going
to be more vulnerabilities because

146
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,720
there's more people I can fuck with yeah
yeah yeah and I mean windows still has a

147
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,900
monthly 12 radovan one but you know
everybody's got their although it when

148
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:38,850
there's another no windows but office is
another regular weekly Excel you know

149
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:46,320
the financials are well yeah and then
PowerPoint PowerPoint so does everybody

150
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,310
want to ride my slides and yours

151
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:58,150
who wouldn't want this site are you

152
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:23,450
I was looking back I like you so the
whole prevention and remediation should

153
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:34,070
review its it's not very popular if it
was they were having better you know

154
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,800
quality assurance and renew we won't
have quite as many vulnerabilities one

155
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:47,420
would assume yeah especially when
quality assurance sometimes just doesn't

156
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,500
exist

157
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,470
you know at that point you wait for the
newest

158
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,180
update to be put out and you take a look
at it because you know well you've got a

159
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,240
good amount of people that are willing
to be guinea pigs and go ahead and

160
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,220
upgrade everything to latest greatest as
well as people hold back there's gonna

161
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:15,200
be holes in whatever you know the new
like to point out anything so you got

162
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,060
there and you try it

163
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,170
absolutely i mean in the thing is it's
with the amount of code people support

164
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,130
and Amanda libraries open source
libraries that people just hole-in-one

165
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,210
here in one there and they just do it
together in your own ok well let's get

166
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,900
it all the work great Kiwi audit first
10 we already released it secure a

167
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,920
production

168
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:50,420
no wait wait wait well you know it's a
pretty safe right maybe ok I I wouldn't

169
00:17:50,420 --> 00:18:01,490
call that QA I just say it's secure it's
a it's ensuring the quality testing but

170
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:15,230
it's not quality assurance quality the
vulnerability veto so do with this and

171
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:32,020
test your code you guys know I didn't
because we just i kno

172
00:18:32,020 --> 00:19:57,779
the world would be

173
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:04,200
and just remember
