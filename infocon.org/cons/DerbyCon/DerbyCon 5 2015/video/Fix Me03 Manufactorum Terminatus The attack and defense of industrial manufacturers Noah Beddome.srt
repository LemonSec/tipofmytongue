1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,660
here to sex first like whoever's
introduce myself my name is no you don't

2
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,470
I'm a senior consultant at NCC group of
the Seattle office which means I'm used

3
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,410
to not seeing the Sun for many months at
a time so that's great I'm a former

4
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,670
Marine which also means that so that
means that I'm used to spending a lot of

5
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,270
time doing physical security behind a 50
Cal and making poor decisions about

6
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:50,870
coming energy drink some pop tarts are
put into my body and completely

7
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,920
unrepentant which leads us to be talking
about the title of the talk and the

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,710
content of the talk show except talk has
made us which is a nod to you for the

9
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,650
minority endeavors Warhammer 40 K two
points so many factor is a big thing big

10
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,820
building that can make such weapons of
destruction in war machines and stuff

11
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,509
and do not mean to wipe out the whole
planet so this is about attacking and

12
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:21,689
defending against industrial
manufacturers in the modern environment

13
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,710
that it was really clever name so I this
is a nice yes we're going to talk about

14
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,619
some of the things and that's a whole
other subjects you can go on for days on

15
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:37,060
ICS escaped a segmentation of those kind
of things we're talking a little bit

16
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:43,130
about some things around it but we're
not going to dive into ICS so this is an

17
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,110
awareness stock so the hope with this
stock ways to generate some awareness

18
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,729
based on some things i have observed
with you my penetration testing

19
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,649
kaczynski see I do penetration testing
and hamper be sorely missed my security

20
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,240
career and over that time of kind of
observed some things and had a lot of

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,290
just chance interaction with industry
manufacturing which to me means much

22
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,860
deeper look at it and see really what's
going on with the hope is that this is a

23
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,930
catalyst certain discussion may be
influenced him changed if an opinion may

24
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,380
be good for people to reexamine

25
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:20,110
some things start talking about
something subjects so overview what

26
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,830
we're gonna talk about right about what
industry manufacturing is talk about the

27
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,150
state of security industry manufacturing
from a difficult couple different points

28
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,440
of view

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,950
supply chain that's really going to play
a big part in why this is important and

30
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:41,250
the impact of early supply chain
compromise so industry specific attacks

31
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,310
about securing the current environment
and also some things we start thinking

32
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,860
about doing for the future so that we
can stop playing catch up and start

33
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:57,010
being proactive and had questions so
this is just a case of a blurb from

34
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,080
Wikipedia but point is that their
definitions and manufacturing industry

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,370
manufacturing our rights we give some
context so manufacturing for the most

36
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,590
part is just the production of material
sometimes my hand but also in the

37
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,920
current environment in our modern day
and age we do a lot of production

38
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,910
automated systems and equipment goes
over to our food

39
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,700
calls and all kinds of other things are
made him use mass scales right and thats

40
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,740
industrial manufacturing so
manufacturing is to make things and

41
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,300
industry manufacturing according to the
government

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,010
this was pulled from one of the industry
definition pages from Nasser's home page

43
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,450
was talking about different affected
sections and government definition of

44
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,850
different business sectors right so one
of those industrial manufacturing which

45
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,580
this gives us a little more detail it
specifically the even the preparation of

46
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,560
food and the conversion of raw materials
and fabrication of either standalone

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,270
objects or component products right and
so the whole point is that these things

48
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:04,140
are created and consumed by some entity
so there's twenty different roughly

49
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,390
twenty different segments that are
recognized by the government of

50
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,260
different types of manufacturing
industry manufacturing

51
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:17,820
available government disseminated
documentation so what factoring is

52
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,590
according to you my observations as well
as communications have had with people

53
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,980
in the sector

54
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,180
observations from research on Google and
different open source information

55
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,870
sections on manufacturing custom
manufacturing in its current state so

56
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,990
just manufacturing I'm gonna read
verbatim from this was gonna talk about

57
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,830
what it is so industrial manufacturing
is a very old very large very high

58
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,690
revenue industry right it's deeply
ingrained in all the components of the

59
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,850
modern supply chain and economic system
so we have to have things to consume

60
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,460
things as consumers we need things to do
stuff cars and vehicles and other

61
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,810
different pieces of equipment can food
all these different things right answer

62
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,540
manufacturing is that group that makes
those things and so what's important

63
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,450
members it's been around so long people
have been doing it

64
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,760
organizations have been doing it and
doing it for very long time and they

65
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,550
were doing it pre animation and I can
able to college so as new technology to

66
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,670
make things more efficient came out they
have tacked things on right so this has

67
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,770
been a developing a boating industry
that primarily focuses on time and

68
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,060
output right so they make their money
and they were able to sustain themselves

69
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,510
by producing the highest-quality
products they can as fast as possible

70
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,830
and meeting as much time as possible so
that there are no revenue streams

71
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,890
interrupt right so it's very people
technology and consumer it takes a lot

72
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,610
of people to run to run an industrial
manufacturing complex right even though

73
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,700
a lot of its automated thanks a lot of
people maintaining equipment stocking

74
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,750
things identifying issues cleaning
maintaining all these things right and

75
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,860
also clerical staff so people running
the actual business side I'm so we have

76
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,340
a lot of people we also have a lot of
technology of different types and with

77
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,130
the advent of IP enabled technology we
have a lot of an Internet of Things

78
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:23,510
phrase from all these different
industrial equipment from the building

79
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,670
arms to pressure cookers you basically
everything you can think of this point

80
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,129
can be producing an IP enables fashions
will be managed centrally

81
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:40,089
so I think the one the big things to
keep in mind is also very large physical

82
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:46,149
footprint so very large amount of space
to do

83
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:51,529
efficient industrial manufacturing takes
up a lot of class and lots of things for

84
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:57,649
extra parts touring of output you get a
lot of area for vehicles and equipment

85
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:01,929
that are used to maintain and operate
the industry so very large amount of

86
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:14,999
space which brings its own concerns and
questions so I want to keep in mind as

87
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:21,129
we move into the state of security in
manufacturing is that with a large

88
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:26,679
amount of staff and the drive behind for
good and for a time in output

89
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:30,779
decisions that are made to allocate
funds are directly impacted by the

90
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:36,749
business I'm insecurity is one of those
kind of Newerth things and as far as the

91
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:43,159
realm of all revenue stream of revenue
base business that it wasn't always a

92
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:48,149
fourth generation and it doesn't
directly impact output so it's something

93
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:54,339
that gets a secondary concern so we're
going to see a scary manufactory

94
00:07:54,339 --> 00:08:01,619
so you're crazy organizational focus on
time if a large number of staff we have

95
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:09,169
the security staff tends to fall under
80 and hire staff to have a very low

96
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:14,149
turnover as far as I can step in general
but there's a relatively low investment

97
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:18,619
in the training and maintaining of those
actually staff as a as a whole

98
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:21,959
now these things I'm gonna say they
don't apply to every single business but

99
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,809
these are things that have been observed
you know in a large number across many

100
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:32,680
organizations within the industry so
equipment vendor independent inventor

101
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,250
dependencies dictate some things that
create exposures within the environment

102
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,490
for things like a touch systems that can
be patched cause of their patch they

103
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,969
break this thing that we need your job

104
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,050
we can update it because it would
require this much down time with this

105
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,069
much investment and the business hasn't
approved that expenditure so those kind

106
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:56,899
of things contribute to a large number
of exposures there's a very high level

107
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:00,699
of technologies across all the different
components within an individual

108
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:05,779
organization because it's easier to
retrofit an existing plant that's been

109
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:10,459
purchased and build a plant from the
ground up doing so they can save money

110
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,410
and therefore generate greater profits
in those kind of things so you get is

111
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,899
organization makes you know and they go
and say okay so this place makes squares

112
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,040
so we're gonna go and we're going to
convert the square making factory that

113
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,370
we just purchased to make calls also the
problem is that they have their own set

114
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,360
of remote access technologies or its
servers and equipment and business

115
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,839
process that had in place for so long
it's very hard to come in and start

116
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,850
moving things around so they don't want
to come up time so what you get is

117
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,149
plantations these technologies visas
these technologies to use these

118
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:49,209
technologies is a whole nother set now
again you don't see that in every

119
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:56,629
organization but its common enough that
it's a major concern so that the large

120
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:01,860
physical footprint exposes a lot of
issues by the can be identified by an

121
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:12,579
attacker in the potential exploited so
far behind the register segmentation so

122
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:17,459
there's a pretty apparent lack of
segmentation because of a large amount

123
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,170
of back touring with in these
environments because they need up to

124
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,959
date very accurate very accurate easily
accessible data from these production

125
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,899
system so that they can identify their
output volumes

126
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:34,860
other decisions around the business so
that's made is that segmentation is not

127
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,170
a primary segmentation somehow
interferes with the current setup so

128
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,649
that they can quickly get their data
then it becomes something that needs to

129
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:47,230
be an acceptable risk by the business to
enable to business to continue producing

130
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:54,700
revenue so security standards are
compromised routinely for to allow

131
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:03,190
more optimal output or to support some
other business operations or need so we

132
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,310
talk about the retrofitting production
facilities also the retention and then a

133
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,270
large number of non-security focus
people are employed by these

134
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,750
organizations as you have lots of
factory workers and clerical staff and

135
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,070
our people and security and all these
different things these people make a

136
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,230
very large population to be targeted by
social engineering and other types of

137
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:33,070
the tax so resulting exposure to rate so
we have issues with unpatched systems we

138
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,450
haven't segmented so we haven't embedded
systems we have minimal corporate

139
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:43,300
segmentation from the actual production
facilities we have staff that are highly

140
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,590
susceptible engineering with large
physical footprint become highly

141
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,380
susceptible to physical tax we have been
consistent implementation of

142
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:58,030
technologies and we have fun hardened
equipment that had things like i've seen

143
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,320
equipment with a weapon able wireless
access point that you can attach to and

144
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,550
then manage the system because you can't
change the password on the actual

145
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,310
control systems that these different
pieces of equipment so the password to

146
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,750
be something like password so you can
use all the basic web attacks to get

147
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,710
access to the wireless access point
management system in the new things like

148
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,850
change how different pieces of equipment
or since most of his communication has

149
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,610
been a plain text between equipment or
using older vehicles because the site

150
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:35,350
has been updated all the time like to do
things like intercept and I'm animal the

151
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,340
traffic so that a readout system is
going to say one thing but the actual

152
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:45,460
value on the controllers and there's a
lot of those kind of things to these

153
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:52,050
different types of exposures so now
we've talked about the issues are going

154
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,730
on and I didn't find that there are some
very significant problems in industry

155
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,250
manufacturing industries for security
goes which definitely is true for a lot

156
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,100
of industries so why is manufacturing
more important or why does it require a

157
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,860
little bit of additional tension

158
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,399
the answer is early supply chain
compromise so chain compromise right for

159
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,079
sweeping changes so supply chain is the
processes which that we as consumers get

160
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,970
things or someone and he receives
something right so this is everything

161
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,680
from raw material to the distribution of
material to the manufacturing or five

162
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,890
min the raw materials whatever becomes
the distribution to retailers to being

163
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:44,019
consumed by the consumer so the reason
this is important is because he impact

164
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:48,029
of compromise and industrial
manufacturing level is pretty

165
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:54,779
significant so when you compromise lets
a user retailer you compromise the user

166
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,910
their trust in an organization or credit
card numbers security number is going to

167
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,640
be respecting individual users and
impacting corporation for the most part

168
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,040
in the short term you'll get a lot of
the current compromises and retail this

169
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,980
kind of things the business hasn't
suffered in long term for the most part

170
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,649
those couples that have disappeared

171
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:16,459
things like Target which was one of the
hugest breaches right target is still

172
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,370
there we also have targets we also go on
skype or credit cards right so that

173
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:27,300
happens when we look at the impact of
other potential components in the supply

174
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,029
chain what's a raw materials we can
impact what materials are available

175
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,970
impact people's health and safety within
like say the remaining a refinement

176
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:41,680
sections like things like you know
releasing breaks or closing down a door

177
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,500
that should be closed or venting gas
those kind of things but again we're

178
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:51,690
targeting a small area one specific
facility etc so we distribution we can

179
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,230
impact the price of things in the
building materials if we were to come

180
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,820
prize distribution company that controls
moving things from one place to the

181
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,459
other but again we're not we're not
impacting the entire population were not

182
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:09,040
impacting a very large number of users
were just causing a blip on the screen

183
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,930
but if we look at what happens with
manufacturing when we get a something

184
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,880
entirely different

185
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,579
we get is a trickle down there are
multiple attacks are we can do to

186
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,260
manufacture that game

187
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,560
released into large populations of
people as well as cons very distinct

188
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,220
very noticeable very media relevant
impacts and repercussions so those

189
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,160
things are like supporting the quality
of a broader so if you have a major

190
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,400
product provider and now you can now
take that major project provider peace

191
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,130
any compromise their systems as a bird
its quality health care quality safety

192
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,520
or consistency you can start impacting
that entire brand of an organization as

193
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,400
well as all the people who receive that
item right where you can weaponize

194
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,230
products so we can compromise the safety
of a product or insular own militias

195
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,520
payloads in some technological products
that allow us than compromise not just

196
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,750
the organization but anyone who consumes
or uses or is exposed the product if we

197
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,110
put even closer we can do things like
there are facilities that have you know

198
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,320
large amounts of dangerous things that
are remote controlled by fighters and if

199
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,300
we can then modify their was dangerous
things system settings we can cause some

200
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:31,620
harm or impact on earnings on in the
very media relevant way and then finally

201
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:38,690
so because of its because of the
industry's and it increased exposure we

202
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,020
can do things like use that compromises
a base camp for a lot of different

203
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,760
things especially how these
manufacturers implement and interconnect

204
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,080
other organizations and other industries
so we'll talk about you to these

205
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,670
individual tax

206
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:06,320
so Subversion server jury undermine the
quality and reputation of an item or an

207
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,250
output night we do things like just
values are the product of the function

208
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:19,030
of its post you can do things like load
images or other things into specific

209
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,500
products so that they are offensive or
somehow damaged the reputation of the

210
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,990
organization we can include other
contact or bring a lower the tolerance

211
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,350
of certain performance is so that
overall the product is of a lower

212
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,490
quality impacting both people who use it
as well as the organization who provides

213
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,130
it so we're going to weaponize in which
is kinda more interesting the tax right

214
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,530
so at this point we think about what can
we do to fix a large number of people

215
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,630
largest number of people possible rate
we can do things like we have control

216
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,180
over what is written to stay like USB
media we can control that instead of the

217
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,840
normal

218
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,500
some type of setup for secure USB device
it's a back toward exe right now we have

219
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,430
access to the devices that are writing
the content to you as being the first

220
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,090
place we also have access to the devices
that can checking the checksums for the

221
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,910
devices once they're written before the
ship so there's some things here we can

222
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,070
start doing where it becomes a
compromise of a single area becomes

223
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,170
compromised in many many users so then
we move on to things like raising

224
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,660
something instead of just getting access
to actually do harm especially in the

225
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,590
case of mass-produced food remastered
screwed if we can modify the

226
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,630
temperatures of what we looked at and
then the temperatures of the readout

227
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,170
that are being used by the employees who
are managing the systems so that they

228
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:48,220
believe that the food to save and we can
then cause a large number of unsafe food

229
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,250
to be distributed via specific channels
things like canned foods are cooked the

230
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,730
fall temperatures in the dark and now
you're not a temperature where things

231
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,810
can grow and constantly botulism and
other things so looking at those as

232
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,420
potential tax realize that this industry
manufacturers are so ingrained in our

233
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,470
lives and general one compromise

234
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:15,530
caused a wave of infection and damaged
so that serious harm talking about

235
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,159
damage to people who are actively
working in these facilities and

236
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,179
equipment

237
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,440
times industry manufacturers are the
heart and soul specific communities

238
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,760
organizations love you generate jobs
because of that they're very important

239
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,679
communities so if you were to damage our
facility harm people thereby controlling

240
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,470
how a specific piece of equipment or how
chemicals are stored things like that

241
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,100
based on IP enabled

242
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,650
access to or physical access to the
plant they are able to then do some

243
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,970
things you didn't realize that you're
not just impacting that organization or

244
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,210
drastically patting the communities that
rely on their organization for their

245
00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:01,929
livelihoods in those can so that spreads
that that damage radius significantly so

246
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:05,730
that we can supply many taxes and we're
talking about setting up base camps so

247
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,150
things like siphoning funds that can
happen with any organization but

248
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,750
specifically relevant with the
manufacturers because they do a huge

249
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:18,669
number of microtransactions micro in
their revenue because they're currently

250
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:22,900
producing amounts of the things they
need to make the things they met or

251
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,190
they're paying someone certain amount or
they're transferring funds from one

252
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,870
facility to another and so because all
the major transactions very easy to see

253
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,429
some smaller transactions into the mix
of sorts siphoning funds of a very large

254
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:42,500
organization won't notice a lot of those
small micro transactions so there we

255
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,480
have things like Long Branch TX against
partners right so a lot of industry

256
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,030
manufacturers also integrate with the
industry manufacturing components for

257
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:57,250
specific organizations to make to their
manufacture another product they usually

258
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,000
have a direct connection to their
environment on some level so that they

259
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,049
can share production data so that you
can use those initial compromises of

260
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:10,460
these relatively soft target to get into
much more important or a much larger

261
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:16,230
organizations so and then enable
physical attackers so one thing that if

262
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,630
your goal is specifically physical if
you have some remote access it's very

263
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,510
easy than to identify things like

264
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,910
video cameras and other things that
would allow you to support a physical

265
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:34,280
team that was going into the facility to
obtain some physical so scary stories so

266
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,900
this is kind of the point where I sit
back and I hope that I have properly

267
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,170
impacted or imported that why this is
important to understand it a little bit

268
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,340
dry right now we're talking about an
industry that has all these things and

269
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,000
everyone's thinking okay well every
industry has these things and issues but

270
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,100
like said the driver is why it's so some
examples of things I've experienced and

271
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,480
been involved with easy access to large
facilities that contain large amounts of

272
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,510
very dangerous chemicals that was able
to get into because they have a very

273
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:12,010
large physical premise and then when you
start looking at the culture around

274
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,000
seven organizations its first physical
address these are usually like factory

275
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,810
workers and like I said people
communities and so really what you need

276
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:25,820
in that case is a hard hat their boots
and jeans and a clipboard and to be very

277
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,810
authoritative about these things you've
identified that are issues so one of

278
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,720
having success with just walking the
perimeter

279
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,690
million square foot manufacturing
complex and just checking the pants and

280
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,000
an occasional find somewhere where
there's no weak link or somewhere I can

281
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,920
get through and I actually passed
through fence right when there is

282
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,050
someone in a quarter that couldn't that
could see me and asked me what I was

283
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,450
doing then explained that it was six
offensive and ordered them to go get a

284
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,610
bunch of things to fix that that's where
they complied with rattling because

285
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,710
physical security such a focus for them
and went and repair the fence and by the

286
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,250
time I left defensive been repaired
right but I had at that point our had

287
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,580
physical access and was looked at as a
trusted person to all this equipment

288
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,920
right because there are very little
technical controls around who can

289
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,200
connect what devices to what network
ports so you can connect to a network

290
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,000
port that's like right beside a giant
manufacturing piece of equipment is

291
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,970
connected to the same feelings it
because these areas are checked very

292
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,700
little other than for the specific
consistencies of the equipment you can

293
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,770
just leave Dropbox has their days if not
months and in several times multiple

294
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,830
weeks I've done entire test environments
just

295
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,039
a single drop box they've dropped on a
network they never found right and

296
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,970
because of his lack of controls and
segmentation were able to get through

297
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,490
networking go from just a single
facility back to the headquarters and

298
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,010
back to all these different percent done
this multiple times and across multiple

299
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:59,740
types of industrial manufacturing harsh
chemicals food pieces of equipment this

300
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,690
kind of things and it's generally the
same around when no one is doing

301
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,640
anything that everyone else is already
doing I'm sure that there are places

302
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,370
that are doing everything right down to
it but as a whole because of the nature

303
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,870
of the organization it's not true right
or at least it's not consistent across

304
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,320
organization so that's an example
physical so there's been things we've

305
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,139
seen on a remote tax where they have
specific pieces of nations that this

306
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:32,760
play remotely and are available to the
internet that have like production data

307
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,130
so that their partners can view it and
it's not really controlled and so these

308
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,970
are homegrown applications with like

309
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,950
so then we can do sequence action on to
the unpatched XP host of been running

310
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,760
this for the last you know six years and
now we're on their internal network and

311
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,320
of course it's not hard and because they
can harden it because the vendors the

312
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,809
box that it's on a host of other options
also vendor supplied and if they updated

313
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:59,240
the whole bring a couple other
applications and you have this huge

314
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,409
masses intertidal web issues right so
why can't a specific company or anything

315
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:09,679
to say that this is very very prevalent
and there needs to be some levels of

316
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,789
education and focus applied so read
stories now let's face it let's talk

317
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:20,580
about actually securing it right so
somebody's going to be done but then I

318
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,179
wanna

319
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:26,830
some things are a little different for
industry manufacturers so we're going

320
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:32,769
for segmentation want to reduce variance
in our technologies that are employed we

321
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:36,490
want to do critical system check
integrity checking so we can I did for

322
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,799
changes in critical systems we want to
maintain functional standards that are

323
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,990
enforced we want to monitoring logging
in learning

324
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:49,380
we want to do want to change its
important remember that regulation

325
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,920
governance and compliance for supplied
to manufacture berries on the product

326
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,770
and the consumer so it's consumed by the
government has different rules it's

327
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,630
consumed by a person there's there may
be very rules depending on the specific

328
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,300
product that's being evaluated for being
produced so with that said since there's

329
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,160
no real overarching regulatory controls
saying all industry sectors must do at a

330
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:20,010
minimum this case yes systems we start
to have some issues to attract enforcing

331
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:27,000
segmentation so Rockwell Automation as
well as partnered with some other device

332
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,170
manufacturers have started trying to put
out some best practices advisories and

333
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,530
things on how I see a system should be
segmented from the standard networks and

334
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,050
their suggestion they gave as well as
his kind of repeated throughout many

335
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:47,000
many documents is that there should be a
DMZ that is established essentially

336
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,700
treats the internal corporate network as
a as the internet and as an untrusted

337
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,610
entity of the DMZ be actual filter for
all of the content

338
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,980
going between right and so that way we
can set it up so that data passing from

339
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:06,230
network to network never actually goes
here she is

340
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:12,059
network without being process modified
sanitized examined and then passed on in

341
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:18,270
a in a controlled channel so we start
looking at those implementations the

342
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,380
problem is right now doing a lot of
these implementations will start to

343
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,730
impact productivity as far as they're
able to ability to monitor the data

344
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,270
because can require them to change a lot
of how they do their communications and

345
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,350
how their current network architecture
is right because a lot of these

346
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:39,250
organizations are old and have very
little investors actually getting

347
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:44,160
trained staff or they have underfunded
eighty steps we have this issue where

348
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,240
they just don't have the knowledge
man-hours sometimes factor that's

349
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,860
limiting them from doing the
implementation even if we have to start

350
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,360
looking at

351
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,060
how do we support these organizations
where r if we were twins organization

352
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,470
support teams to help them optimize what
tools we have in place to start

353
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:08,220
implementing more secure ways to say
when our networks so another example is

354
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,270
that segmentation talkin bout between
the actual manufacturing plants and the

355
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:17,350
corporate headquarters and other plants
right so I've been in plants in the

356
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:22,390
country where I hit a launch attacks
against like ones on the other side so

357
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,850
from california tax New York New York I
could attack facility in Canada those

358
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,910
things and then have colleagues who have
done testing against you know even

359
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:37,460
plants outside of the USA and they were
able to even span you know national

360
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:44,450
borders so with the segmentation so
lacking the US concern about even if you

361
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,190
had some type of look strong protections
in place the amount given jump from

362
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,580
place to place really increases attack
surface so greatly right but if we're

363
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,470
doing strong cemeteries in with how
we're doing fairly dim seeing our

364
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,600
networks and this kind of things and
making sure our plants can't really talk

365
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,040
to each other across a crude channels
then we start to really reduce that tax

366
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:14,930
service overall so we're going to reduce
variance so that just means that when we

367
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,570
go in and we set up a new organization
that those things we want to make sure

368
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:23,600
that we have unified uniformly deployed
protections in those kind of things are

369
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,240
using the same technologies as much as
possible so that we can create a

370
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,220
discipline of expertise in our
individual technology and we can build

371
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,880
proficiency in handling that technology
right which means we can deploy it

372
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,620
quickly and efficiently to play in a way
that is more secure and then when we

373
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,890
have our guys have to do something last
minute to minimize the amount of time

374
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,720
they actually have to spend doing it
which means we can get more efficiency

375
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:55,130
out of our actual people in manpower
right so it's good so critical system

376
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,770
integrity checking so this is just the
fact that we have a bold image we have

377
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:03,160
something that is a critical system we
need to be able to maintain that hasn't

378
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,440
been modified so this is something that
is going to pack somebody's health

379
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,389
potentially impact on safety we need to
be able to look at it and say yes only

380
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:17,480
matches this value and so that goes into
production of a gold images and out of

381
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,950
band offline stored secure manner that
goes into implementing some way to

382
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,750
create a check some of our host and
manage that checks this close to making

383
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,940
sure that all our changes are controlled
and monitored we have some type of

384
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,980
change management monitoring and a
policy in place so maintain functional

385
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,919
standards this goes back from the actual
doing to the policy and documenting

386
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,149
so we need to have standards and
compliance advisories and policies

387
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:51,039
internally and those kind of things that
dictate how we should do things they

388
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,370
need to be monitored and then he'd be
enforcement needs to be an understanding

389
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,100
and education disseminated throughout
the organization to make sure that

390
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:03,309
everyone is aware so this should include
things like encryption authentication

391
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:06,559
mechanisms and service configurations

392
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,860
authentication so this is true for
everything in my opinion this point is

393
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,639
that we're we move beyond password being
in the right password is no longer

394
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,620
enough to defend against most attacks
because there are so many things that

395
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:24,350
have advanced repeat password password
just is not enough protection so we need

396
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,889
password plus one at a minimum and are
non critical systems and then in a

397
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:35,210
critical systems we need password + to
so something that goes beyond just two

398
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,149
factor authentication multi-factor
authentication there has to be something

399
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:43,330
like you have a thing you know a thing
you are some or something you know

400
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,850
analog format that allows multiple
levels of education in the news

401
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,129
significant monitoring and logging and
alerting around those on medications and

402
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:58,929
even in some case manual follow up on
specific occasions so this is one of the

403
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:04,570
ones I really wanna just take a minute
think about is that is great and we

404
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,669
always hear people say for sure is that
restricts entry please don't throw it

405
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:12,169
all come up with reasons why doesn't
work and it's true in other situations

406
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:15,460
back it doesn't apply because we have to
have significant amounts of information

407
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,670
is double spaced lines but

408
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:23,610
in ICS network that is relatively static
configuration that communicates with

409
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,340
specific channels all the time

410
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,810
only communicates any certain ways it
makes it very out to put interest

411
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:33,590
expense cuz you can basically look at an
ICS network and basically see it

412
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,670
function and relatively same way with
some slight variance the same way for

413
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:42,850
months if not years right and so when do
we start seeing variances then we can

414
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,870
know that something is significantly
different there doesn't just help stop

415
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:50,920
attackers and also helps to identify
malfunction that could potentially save

416
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,480
lives of people who are working in
industries so therefore the future so

417
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,440
this is kind of okay what's next week
said there's not a lot of regulatory

418
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,610
compliance governance around and
destruction the whole there's not a lot

419
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:09,030
of awareness and communication and
discussion about these are these items

420
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,040
really own people discussing them with
the people were selling industry

421
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,070
specific devices to fix the problem for
the promise that is we have vendors who

422
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:22,070
are only source of information as
consumers or official race teams are

423
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,740
thinking okay you're just telling me
something I don't need this because you

424
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,480
just want to make the money you want to
make you try to convince everyone that

425
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,350
we all know blue shoes for whatever
reason but we're fine with the simple

426
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:40,450
fact is that in them and how important
this is how it is in fact it is really

427
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:47,350
distracting considerations about putting
out information and devices that are

428
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,500
specifically tailored to meet these
needs

429
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,960
officials that that's where US right if
we pan testers we need to know

430
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,950
were talking about we go dependencies
environments and over looking forward we

431
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,000
need to demonstrate why it's important
we also need to be able to clearly

432
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,810
delineate how to fix this is the biggest
problem with industry manufacturers

433
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:11,260
consuming security services is it normal
network level Pinterest you throw manner

434
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:19,380
or a large plant she goes to show how do
we will be the most effective way

435
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:26,100
specifically for our industry and the
conductor says I need to find out so we

436
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,089
did some googling or truck somebody and
then comes up with a very good sounding

437
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:37,750
case that to you who is very intense
about getting this answer so we need to

438
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,640
do is as a team as a group as an
industry of security professionals we

439
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,250
need to get the information flowing
between us and start creating guy dances

440
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,190
and ways to teach other people how to do
this properly can actually start

441
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,240
securing things making things safer for
people predicting producing things we

442
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:01,390
consume every day so and that goes right
with that reality of the tracks right if

443
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:06,340
we just stay here on Patch they're not
going to care systems that will take you

444
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,440
this long to do it based on the things
I've observed and and conversation with

445
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,790
your people that might mean more if it
you can say hey I can shut down your

446
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:19,770
systems and I can based on this access
go we can do this amount of damage

447
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,740
either to a reputation to people to do
things when you start talking about loss

448
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,640
of business like business test events
where it's almost undercover talk about

449
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,950
like large losses of life obviously
don't do that with a client if they're

450
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,420
sent about these things but when you
start hinting at those things are huge

451
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:42,090
in an accident with your screenshots are
you testing in your technical skill why

452
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:47,220
this is true then you start getting some
real change and like budget that's kind

453
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:53,540
of a major change right is competent
budget allocated to fix this problem so

454
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,590
I got three minutes left

455
00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:04,200
questions so I went a little as a little
slower than expected

456
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:27,440
so I don't have the exact rooms with me
but there are some laws specifically

457
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,780
around chemical refinement manufacturing
so like things like like anything that

458
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:39,490
can be used for explosives originated
ammonia like fuel gasoline anything

459
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:44,410
that's a tall incendiary anything that's
caustic or your 10th those things all

460
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,480
have very specific laws on storage and
things but not necessarily around

461
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,140
security on the network level but how
are there are very strict physical rules

462
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,579
for instance I'm to be present in all of
the facilities that manufacture

463
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:02,020
manufacturer find large amounts of
chemicals are also present release

464
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,210
interacted with by ports and other
transitory communities they have to have

465
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,359
a TWIC cards to be present on the
premise and because of that that's a

466
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:16,280
very focused on physical security right
but if you have a TWIC card which $250

467
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,829
and a background check right so if
you've never committed a known colony

468
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:28,589
and you have $150 you are very very
official looking very official-looking

469
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:34,220
piece of government identification so
that's right folks on the physical

470
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,280
because physical gets scary and also
permanent home defense in this kind of

471
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,770
things

472
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,050
strictly regulate access to maritime
facilities in these kind of things but

473
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:46,210
nothing that I know of at least
identified that specifically says their

474
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,040
network is configured this way other
than Weichert which is very clear and

475
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,910
missed so nice to if they are being
consumed by the government

476
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,579
their products directly like they're
producing a military-grade comment on

477
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:01,329
this will definitely have enforcement
and on it but because missus when the

478
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:04,349
things that is most people who are
subject to this are also on the panel

479
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:08,490
that defines missed this becomes kind of
a problem right like this is an issue

480
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,839
that doesn't get fixed by its own
compliance standards because the guy

481
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,260
gets to spend a million dollars to fix
it

482
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,560
decide if it's something that he

483
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,470
the pics questions before they have time
for one or two more than

484
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:52,470
yeah absolutely

485
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:57,790
so what we need to do is part of those
going forward is trying to like i mean

486
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,610
it's obviously an issue in every vendors
do something they don't put a sometimes

487
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:07,110
that equipment is just produced to make
money whatever it is right and so you

488
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,310
always see security guys were really
concerned about that the king of the

489
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,180
vendor to change something so yeah we
need to start training influence our

490
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,790
vendors create better products overall
and the fattest care professionals we

491
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,690
can partner with those organizations and
say hey let us know about asians right

492
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,260
there's a lot of times where companies
we can do it pro bono foundations of

493
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:30,250
specific work so that they can publish
publicly these are good good advantages

494
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,760
to say to accompany hey let us help you
fix your product you let us published a

495
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,640
white paper and then you look very
secure and then we get to have some

496
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,040
media coverage so these are things that
has high level for people with in

497
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,700
securitizations we can do to try to
influence and push those vendors I think

498
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,410
we're out of time

499
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:55,510
time for questions I know it's not the
most entertaining and exciting talk and

500
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,960
have any room for silly cat pictures but
I promise the next time I'll have a lot

501
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,850
of money content the doesn't pertain to
the material thanks very much
