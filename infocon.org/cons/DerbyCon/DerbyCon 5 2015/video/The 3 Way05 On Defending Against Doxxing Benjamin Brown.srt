1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,490
and workshops on that and on doing it
quietly and we just work with the

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:16,520
government and with some law enforcement
to help bring them up to speed with the

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,699
new world of cyber crime so to the main
terms we talk about your inbox and

4
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,789
spawning so I wanted to set them in
context for this talk about boxing I

5
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:32,640
mean having somebody's information
typically the private information and

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,930
then posting it in a public forum and
then telling people to go look at it

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,170
uses various purposes

8
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,950
includes the full name current physical
address email addresses usernames

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,570
numbers and pictures sometimes little
things like Social Security numbers bank

10
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,739
account and routing information and then
all of this information about people

11
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,859
that they're tied to let their friends
and family and then from that

12
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:05,770
information something that can happen
and unfortunately does happen is we're a

13
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,510
SWAT team is deployed to a house based
in that house is usually the target for

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:21,290
Trestman so why do we care about boxing
well hierarchy things to care about here

15
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:32,470
it's annoying but he did you like having
people send you messages to the

16
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,100
information that was police also getting
some great marketing of people trying to

17
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,890
scam you and then the next level would
be like having something you didn't want

18
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,460
out there out there maybe you have a
hobby that you really want to keep

19
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:52,350
yourself and you having that it can
sometimes be damaging and then online

20
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,469
and in-person harassment bullying
talking and then that's usually

21
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,030
financial aid in this case

22
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,479
and of course I was watching us down
your socks so that's definitely a danger

23
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:12,850
of being targeted for yourself or your
property which will see examples of that

24
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:19,100
later so it's the online stuff is tough
to deal with but it's the in person so

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,190
it's really scary even if they're not
talking to you personally they can do a

26
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,270
plot to harm your way of life or damage
you one of the things they have your

27
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,220
physical address

28
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,850
they can not going to slash her tires so
that's something you really really gonna

29
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:43,180
happen because because yes so you know
the things that can happen but i wanna

30
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,680
get to some real cases may be tangible
the first one I want to talk about this

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,150
was during the bus bombings when your
chances at least do some amazing

32
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,630
detective work so one of the people that
they are being a prime suspect for

33
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:09,750
bomber in Boston was guilty party which
was brown and so he had been missing

34
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:18,320
since March 16 and has not only
identified as really good target for

35
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,320
single bomber fortune read it but a lot
of new services

36
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:33,190
credibility's feeling started receiving
death threats and his family's in his

37
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:40,670
personal information they were targeted
both in person and digitally what had

38
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,820
really happened here was happening was
missing because he had committed suicide

39
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,570
bombings place in his body was later
found in the province river so his

40
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:58,290
family was not only having to deal with
the justice and justice

41
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:12,469
arise where she took her life after a
long history being blackmailed and

42
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:18,289
stocked online and so none of us wanted
to play white knight and find out who

43
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:26,039
did it again the docs the wrong person
so the person that they tossed his

44
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:31,259
business so his boss eventually told him
what you need to make the stop which of

45
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,220
course a hand or you're going to be
fired up getting fired from his job

46
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,820
because the harassment and he eventually
became so bad had to move across the

47
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:51,139
country and legally changed his complete
all his life just because another person

48
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:57,280
in their mother caught up in the stocks
increase was when Mike rounds shot

49
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,669
anonymous again wanted to find out the
police officer was the shot they ended

50
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,960
up boxing somebody that had never had
any dealings with the purpose of police

51
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,240
and they ended up not only dachshund him
by his mother as well and they were able

52
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,190
to get things like social security
numbers of and maiden name so what

53
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,360
happened was a lot of credit cards and
bank accounts lines of credit things

54
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,830
like that room and up in their name and
they're still cleaning up all of that

55
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:34,130
idea that they had to deal with their
their stores are trash so although that

56
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:41,139
is it's difficult to deal with but there
isn't necessarily an immediate sense but

57
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,740
something that does cause that in the
absence of danger is having a group of

58
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,860
heavily armed people busting your door
perhaps at 3 a.m. without a knock and

59
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,050
having guns we got Lites wave in your
face where your

60
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:04,289
little rock you end up getting hurt that
situation or you sleep next to one of

61
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:10,400
the officers might end up getting seated
see a lot of examples of swatting

62
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,449
happening live here is that we're
playing a game against somebody or a

63
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,289
group of people and somebody they were
playing with her somebody was watching

64
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,629
them took offense to either something
they said they're just being alive in

65
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,099
general and then called in the SWAT
teams to their house after tossing them

66
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:36,539
during GamersGate just kind of stuff
going on a lot of the proponents of

67
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:43,129
opening up gaming as a lifestyle and as
a recreation to a broader demographic

68
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:49,889
became targets boxing and sweating as
well and there are a number of stories

69
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:57,129
about this there's also got docs like
seven times and he's been spotted

70
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:58,440
multiple times

71
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,009
Brian Krebs has but that's not really
surprising given what he does for a

72
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:11,849
living and job at it off cities so let's
both Ashton Kutcher and breakups had

73
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:19,050
some success and protecting themselves
against wanting a real chicken shit you

74
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:25,680
don't wanna do it yourself and there is
a new SAS that's what his service and

75
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:34,190
this is all 100 bucks within 10 days the
sky will get the swatching to bust into

76
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,300
the target of your choice they think
this is a real service to people

77
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:48,810
actually got the cops to come

78
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,160
you know delivered as promised I wasn't
tracked he's very good at what he or she

79
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:08,419
does so it's not just a Western right so
we see analogues for boxing both in Asia

80
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,830
and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
bloc so and China is typically referred

81
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:19,250
to as the human flesh search engine and
it started out as a collaborative

82
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:29,150
research on a scale what they would do
initially as they look for evidence of

83
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:35,240
people who are officials and power that
have been taking bribes or they look for

84
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,890
people who have been falsifying their
information and their research which is

85
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,880
a big problem in China right now and it
started out as a sort of like me want to

86
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,529
do this good but we need to do so I know
somebody who works here you know

87
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:55,400
something that works there with her but
certain turning out for a while and

88
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,829
being used to help people who did need
to be out in about it incorrectly it was

89
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:08,540
also used to turn my internet
celebrities in Jax stopping and fixation

90
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:15,790
and its two engines or that we see in
all the cases of boxing for the russian

91
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,500
and former Soviet bloc it is almost
exclusively focused on giving

92
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,970
information about celebrities and for
some reason rap celebrities are huge

93
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,290
especially their cell phone numbers
there were quite a bit and they're

94
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,810
treated typically like baseball cards
one guy will say hey I have the

95
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,990
celebrity in the celebrities information

96
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:45,470
but I want this trade with you so and
China is an example of what was called a

97
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:54,700
campaign and what they do this they find
officials who are officiating over

98
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:02,010
typically very very small areas or poor
areas that have flashy watches and these

99
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:09,589
officials tend to wear a different
fashion watch for the year for these

100
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:14,410
watches so what they do is they go
online and try to find evidence of

101
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,779
pictures of these guys wearing really
really expensive watches and you can see

102
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:26,360
that this particular black student of
this online campaign decided to take my

103
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,750
picture I gotta take off my watch turns
out this very him around his watch area

104
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:46,880
so that really work out for gold watches
so this is the other side of of that and

105
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,690
that this is an innocent taxi owner what
happened was a taxi drove by on town in

106
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,870
China and rolled down his window it's
not homeless person that's on the side

107
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,240
of the road a couple of the
eye-witnesses were only able to get a

108
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,430
partial license plate number and
unfortunately this taxi owners license

109
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,540
plate matches that partial but you know
they can't know the rest

110
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,880
and she was outed as being the most
likely candidate so course in

111
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,040
everybody's mind he was the person that
did it he had red paint thrown all over

112
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,470
his house and death threats written to
him almost daily telling him that

113
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,940
they're gonna ruin his business and he
better move out of the city and things

114
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:36,630
like that which unfortunately you know
he's here he is innocent and some really

115
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,769
really nice Eastern European guy put up
this web page for a while it's not down

116
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:49,250
anymore but he had collected a whole
bunch of different peoples celebrities

117
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,560
in the person's information including
Social Security numbers cell phone

118
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,699
numbers addresses just post them for
free for everybody so Britney Spears

119
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:07,970
again I don't support in a career
Octomom in case you want to call herself

120
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:21,449
so not only used against innocent people
it's also used between people and you

121
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:27,760
are either at war with each other for
some perceived slight or for market

122
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,529
share in some form or another so kids
you like to proclaim themselves as being

123
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:38,430
undock cybill inevitably are the first
ones to be taxed and that's that's a big

124
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,139
thing that you can see and if you really
have a constitution to sit and listen to

125
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:47,889
them in there are some forms a chance or
in their forums they try and talk to

126
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:52,839
each other all time when thaksin was
still up in their other ones like it out

127
00:12:52,839 --> 00:13:00,050
now it was just 14 and 13 year olds left
in writing boxed it's also used to

128
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:06,399
outright with sellers and to get their
market share if say you have plastic her

129
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,889
credit cards or who are doing cloning

130
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:18,250
get rid of all the other people who are
also selling out products you can price

131
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,370
by corner of Market and what you do is
you docs and the other sellers and then

132
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,279
find out where they live in Daxing
information and prove that they're

133
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,660
selling things to their local police
that way they get caught and then you

134
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,510
get to sell where they used it's also
used as responsible were considered

135
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:42,149
rivers are preggers this is people who
service like they're going to capture

136
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:50,309
file for use OMB detected by and they go
ahead and pay you and you don't deliver

137
00:13:50,309 --> 00:14:00,360
on service stocks lower as well it's
also used on our network to markets as a

138
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,170
form of coercion to get you don't
finalized early as a seller you're

139
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,420
giving up quite a bit of information
about yourself in order to get a

140
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,949
physical products and if you're up
second good which most of the buyers on

141
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:16,240
seconds terrible then the vendor to turn
around saying look I have all this

142
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,300
information about you give it to the
police unless you finalize early and you

143
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,800
don't get your product but I get your
money it's also used as a sort of get

144
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,490
out of jail free card what happens is
dark meat market vendors will get all of

145
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,839
this information on their buyers and
then when they eventually get pension

146
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,050
what they say is hey I got all this
information on all these people that

147
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:44,209
remind these goods if I turned informant
and you let me go

148
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:55,550
so how did they find out this
information and what they call Campbell

149
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,699
food which is just really understanding
Boolean search operators and they'll

150
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,279
typically start with a username or email
address and one of the other and then

151
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:08,569
try to match over user names that were
used in conjunction with an email

152
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:15,899
address or all of the email addresses
the junction with different forums you

153
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,639
wrong you also use look for variations
of user names like if you were sweet

154
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:28,399
bunny 123 they would look for suite 111
go through all this innovations and if

155
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,809
they could find other points that match
to say that this account is also one of

156
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:37,230
you how to use them that's more
information that they have also when you

157
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,670
put something on line it's really good
to think about this being out there

158
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,860
publicly for ever and ever amen

159
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,720
because just because the website is down
or the buses the information be removed

160
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,179
or you delete it doesn't mean it's not
still in the database backup like the

161
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:05,829
Wayback Machine removal cash or cash so
other place to go to Facebook Twitter

162
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:13,019
Instagram people but tons and tons of
personal information contact info where

163
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,790
they go when they go family member
information with their friends are there

164
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,920
latencies their hobbies are their skill
sets the jobs they currently have in the

165
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,920
places that they used to work as well as
their colleagues are really really good

166
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,339
for social engineering also a patterns
of behavior what places they give you

167
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:41,019
regularly things like that and when
they're not at all but you forswear also

168
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,160
all of this

169
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,759
social media is really good for building
a database be able to answer people's

170
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,720
security questions to reset their
passwords especially for their main

171
00:16:51,720 --> 00:17:00,540
email accounts password then you can get
access to all the other also we don't

172
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:10,949
necessarily think about the social media
but our groups like your fingers on my

173
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:18,480
people lose their menu for the most
popular frameworks it ask you when you

174
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,350
sign up for an account for your birthday
page and location

175
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:29,559
a lot of people and so on your profile
at this year's Eurovision how long

176
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,270
you've been made how often you like that

177
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:38,980
also if you're in a four oh that's maybe
or non mainstream that may be something

178
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,850
you want to keep on the downlow
information to get out as well

179
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:51,770
also talked to a lot so what's your name
your email addresses online are you a

180
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,940
conversation with often that's really
good to do and then used as a trust

181
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,650
factor to get you to click on something
malicious or get more information out of

182
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:08,820
you also a lot of these social media are
reached for they will be reached at some

183
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,620
point in the near future there couple
examples of this is just within the last

184
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:20,640
year or so games for owns CBS photo all
of those accounts were breached my

185
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,460
freedom smokes 40 action target law
enforcement targets pains for some

186
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,760
reason somebody had to be tails I don't
know why they do that which I know why

187
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,770
they would do that

188
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,250
/ like was a really interesting happen
that its Chapman and his sons

189
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,310
there's a lot of good information that
would be gained their specialties and

190
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,520
people thought that their chapter
private and then those are also like

191
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,040
general forums you might not be giving
up too much to see information there but

192
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,190
there are other places where a lot of
people gave up really do seem like you

193
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,530
don't reach so there were a lot of
blackmailing that came out of that

194
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,310
because it told not only your
connections and partners were but what

195
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:11,630
sort of things you are into so yeah that
was bad but probably not as bad as the

196
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:20,710
Ashley Madison an act and while I don't
feel too bad for the guys that were

197
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:28,310
caught up in that and the what one
hundred and twelve women I do feel that

198
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:36,420
for their families though because there
are affiliated with anonymous kids were

199
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,090
going around and collating by location

200
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,440
accounts in their contact information
and boxing them and then contacting all

201
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,190
of their friends and family outings
somebody mad dash to matts another place

202
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,530
where you get a lot of personal
information about somebody is there when

203
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,480
they register domain names it ask you to
enter in your real e-mail address that

204
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,600
he is your physical location or the
physical location of your business phone

205
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,440
number and then if you're still in the
nineties there are also some tools that

206
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,740
makes this easier to harvest is a really
fun too so this will allow you to go

207
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:26,690
ahead and get a bunch of information on
an entity or individual especially if

208
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,170
you have the domain for their email
address and alter ego you not only with

209
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,200
the transforms for searching but to
think about the

210
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,860
relationships and connections is a
Python scripts that is it goes through

211
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:51,549
and find a bunch of them through
Facebook through Foursquare Twitter to

212
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:55,760
get a lot of information that you can't
get through the browser but the API in

213
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,480
these jeans are really good framework
for doing a lot of the things that some

214
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:10,340
of these other tools to organize it in a
way that's pretty conducive to good

215
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,450
dossier there's a few other tools if
you're interested I can give you some

216
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:23,190
wins two other ones there's one calls
since dr. it has a facebook stalker

217
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,950
which uses Facebook Graph API which even
if you really locked down your Facebook

218
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:34,899
profile it gets information to your
friends and your friends of friends and

219
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:39,090
able to build a profile about you
through that it also has an OS in

220
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:46,260
stalker stalker and what that does is it
goes through all of the ATI is social

221
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:52,200
media platforms that use GPS data where
you are and what you're doing that to

222
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:13,340
build a pattern of we're going to go so
I N T Dr open source intelligence yeah

223
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,510
and then recon angie is another one that
has a bunch of scripts that are similar

224
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,440
to what the harvester does what he does

225
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:32,960
so it's a stalker is there another place
to get a scary amount of information on

226
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,759
individuals is through the burgers are
getting their houses I'm sure some of

227
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,220
you have seen the ads or tried to look
up and then realized you had to pay even

228
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,200
though it first

229
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,129
Intelius people there are a bunch of
them out there and for free typically

230
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:55,230
get the full name sometimes maiden name
the age the current former addresses and

231
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,759
all this information about their family
members the funny thing is a lot of them

232
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,370
try to only a partial phone number for
the person but they all do it

233
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,559
differently so if you just go across
them and get a little bit of the phone

234
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:12,330
number you can get the whole one out of
the park also if you pay more than you

235
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,580
get more information get things like
criminal records school records retail

236
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,679
activity information the retail activity
information is interesting when you go

237
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,009
into a store and they ask you for your
zip code and your phone number and that

238
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:28,870
sort of information that really doesn't
make sense for the purchase you're

239
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,100
making its because a lot of times that
information is bundled up and sold to

240
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,720
third parties for targeted marketing and
they're not really scrupulous about they

241
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:44,320
sell not too as long as you got it back
of money that information so Intelius

242
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,549
you could see they have they don't tell
you what to use the native or they just

243
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,690
say you know this is the type to data
will give you at these different years

244
00:23:51,690 --> 00:24:02,269
of pricing and of course there's a
special for first-time buyers and stuff

245
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:06,240
you know is a little little more
specific about what their information is

246
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,470
they actually saw their advertisements
that they say that they uncover personal

247
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:18,710
views and secrets guaranteed you know
you want to see something juicy jizz

248
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:23,600
deep within 48 need your social networks
to find the truly mouthwatering news but

249
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:43,429
friends and co-workers wow so it's great
very very difficult but public records

250
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:49,220
another huge place for getting
information on people they're a pain you

251
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,309
asked to go through because a lot of
them are using outdated systems were the

252
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:58,129
governments that are local governments
are bringing these public records online

253
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:06,799
aren't they don't hire good UX so when
you are incorporated in business or

254
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,460
buying a piece of property or house when
you are registering for her trademark

255
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,980
they're going to ask you for a lot of
information that is made public so

256
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,009
Commission about your business partners
about your addresses and there's

257
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:26,990
mysteries of business connections and
mapping stuff entities with her time

258
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:32,100
there even business websites that have
little graphs that show you and the

259
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,730
different buildings and people you're
connected to and how you are connected

260
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,629
to them

261
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:44,580
example of public record is this is a
public record for a home and mom County

262
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,330
North Carolina and this is you know
anybody can go on the website for the

263
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,960
county and look at this information you
know where they live with their current

264
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,840
address is as well as the address of the
property how much the properties were

265
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,619
how much were the history of the
property and the history of the taxing

266
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:09,299
and something really interesting here is
the ownership history and that you can

267
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,490
see it was just recently sold

268
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:16,179
and if a property was just recently sold
and you were posing as the person who

269
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,040
just sold the property I better target
will open up any attachment you sent to

270
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:27,550
them through email so it also gives
information about the physical layout of

271
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,870
the house including square footage of
each section and a lot of times it'll

272
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,220
tell you what the slogan bridges on the
yard things like that so something was

273
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,570
planning on being a super creeper and
stalking you now they have all the

274
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:49,050
information they needs you plan that out
accordingly

275
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:56,900
records if you're not being super
sneaking in doing it through a super PAC

276
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,240
that gives your name address your
political affiliation and the donation

277
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,660
amounts especially with a history of
donation amounts and some other nation

278
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:11,870
have a pretty good shot at getting
somebody's network also positions

279
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:16,710
positions for recall things like that
that kids name geographic location and

280
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:23,350
again for social engineering if they
know what you're passionate about excess

281
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:30,990
data so sometimes go to metadata a lot
of media pictures videos audio along

282
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:37,910
with the actual has attached to it on
the back and information about the

283
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:44,340
device with her and that she's created
times and dates when it was a lot of

284
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,330
times GPS coordinates about you know
when it was created so an example of

285
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:54,570
that is this is this is the information
from a picture taken with a Nikon d300

286
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,720
this is with its default settings on
gives the time and date the picture was

287
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,650
taken as well as the latitude longitude
of where the picture was taken

288
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:11,290
so this information is necessarily used
for various purposes it's also been used

289
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,620
effectively to go ahead and send
telephones you members of peace on state

290
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:25,750
and speaking specifically off excess
data and media person role that it was a

291
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:31,090
post on social media to bombs targeting
less than 24 hours so they were able to

292
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:36,130
get the data from the social media
accounts and use that you target them

293
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:43,280
were drunk and just because Facebook
were immature or Twitter doesn't show

294
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:53,750
the Exadata when they proposed a
database me another instance when

295
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:03,480
eligible he's the leader of the Sinaloa
cartel in Mexico his dumbass on there

296
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,470
and so they're hiding in central america
trying to run from the Mexican military

297
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:21,880
and his took a picture of them all
eating and left GPS so social

298
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,200
engineering is a big part doctor as well

299
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,420
juicy formation about somebody calling
their ISP company can get you some

300
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:39,110
really good information including the
call records what their browsing history

301
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:45,020
you know all that sort of the account
login information and it's really

302
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:51,570
effective especially when they call has
a spouse or family member or a delegate

303
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:55,710
the people who were complete your 14
ISBN phone companies don't get trained

304
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:03,470
very well on spotting fishing social
engineering also calling for a place

305
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,600
somewhere that you are doing a
background check that you are a new

306
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,130
place of work that is doing a records
check you get a lot of information out

307
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:16,210
of people also if you call their family
posing as a friend or call their friends

308
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,190
or family member and pretend that there
is an emergency with your target that

309
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:25,800
their mortal danger hurt really bad when
his friends or family members go into

310
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,790
panic mode they don't tend to think
critically about what sort of

311
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:52,840
information that they're giving up

312
00:30:52,840 --> 00:31:20,970
between the two of you and i got very
bad so that they knocked on the door

313
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:27,620
like three times and this is what is
happening you can see lots of other live

314
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,779
recordings of it either from the aspect
SWAT team or from the aspect of person

315
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:39,289
actually being slaughtered and it's
pretty terrifying just to watch it I

316
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:44,679
can't imagine actually being in that
situation and the way that it works when

317
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,610
you call 911 is a cell phone number

318
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,090
the not only your voice

319
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:57,100
information your GPS information but you
and I as well and with all of that

320
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,179
information and your face one of these
two location information that goes

321
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:09,510
through system which checks the 911
database and it's simple to verify if

322
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:15,980
you are actually where you are you are
actually pulling from the number you're

323
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,360
calling from so it kind of weed out
people were trying to smooth other

324
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:26,919
people's numbers and so phase one piece
to the vision data is it's a callback

325
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:33,549
number that's how our idea that you're
actually near the great advice and

326
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:38,269
you're asking me to call a location and
it also gives you

327
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:43,999
so what that does is it confirms or
validates the location and its location

328
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:49,859
on the map the dispatcher and allows
them to provide by routing information

329
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:55,519
for where they should go so when you
wanna call it a slut and you'll

330
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,450
obviously failed the confirmation call
911 when you actually get the SWAT team

331
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:08,529
and the non-emergency line they don't go
through all that means is that they

332
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:14,289
don't check to see if you're spoofing or
not you are so many volunteer agency

333
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:23,509
line they still operate emergency but
doesn't have a fancy track so how do we

334
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:29,769
actually one of the first line of
defense is social media mindfulness you

335
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:33,249
don't have to constantly tell everybody
where you are at all times

336
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:39,429
everything about your private life
online so you can type setting goals on

337
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:49,129
Facebook and restrain yourself American
high five and one of your connection

338
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:54,950
request is not put your money to catch
them all you know it's it's a really

339
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,589
really useful dr. providing a lot of
information about a person or

340
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:04,039
organisation and as you go online right
now you can find research projects using

341
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,299
its you out a bunch of people secrets
especially confidential project they're

342
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:12,379
working on unpacking yourself

343
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:16,079
judiciously online is something that's
very effective just because you have

344
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,099
that does not mean that your friends do
so

345
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:26,589
going in and when they take you on
facebook just had to find more

346
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:27,950
information about you

347
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:32,490
third party pass especially in facebook
when you install third-party app the

348
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:37,149
company that you installed it does not
necessarily all the rights that perhaps

349
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:38,000
the next year

350
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,889
that they can sell that information and
they do other companies and what it does

351
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:49,370
it not only gives information about your
profile but your friends and that's very

352
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:57,960
very good marketing data or somebody's
trying to docs you want to of course use

353
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,790
a strong cast freezes wherever possible
please use two factor authentication

354
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:08,560
don't passwords and especially don't
reuse passwords and the same user names

355
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,880
across accounts I can't tell you how
many of our retail banking

356
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:22,790
hospitality customers have checkers
preach to go and try a bunch of

357
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,660
different sites with the same
credentials that were dropped in

358
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:32,840
outreach and a lot of times they get
into account that way also your did your

359
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,660
life journal that has painful things to
read you don't still need that publicly

360
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,370
available download the information and
take it offline that's information that

361
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:46,240
could definitely be used against you
also don't assume all includes removable

362
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,550
it's going to be on the internet the
chance for a long time and when he

363
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,240
retail site asks you hate you will
receive your credit card and location

364
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,370
information for your purchases that
information goes into a database nine

365
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:07,180
times out of ten knots very well and
that averages going at some point and

366
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:18,660
the people who work there so you don't
actually have to mention just a dress

367
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,870
that you can be contacted that you can
also use a third-party proxy

368
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:36,560
registration service and I can pose that
there are some restrictions made on just

369
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,790
the following that nothing has been
cashed yet but it's definitely something

370
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,760
we will follow

371
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,430
data clearing houses they all have their
legally required to just don't always

372
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:54,600
make them for Spokeo people they just
require an email address for

373
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,029
verification

374
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:03,000
also it's really small bottom but if you
want these slides that the bottom has a

375
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,880
list of pretty much all of the major

376
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,280
houses and how to opt-out of them for
white pages I'll tell you typically need

377
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,040
email address and phone number

378
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,910
intelligence I'm not so sure about this
one I i want you to take down my

379
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:28,690
personal information so you're asking me
for a couple of my career so we get your

380
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,990
mileage may vary in your own personal
risk matrix if you were very very public

381
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:41,990
figure than that might be something
that's a big deal for you we are going

382
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:53,130
to you and then say hello see something
that you want to use patent trademark

383
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,680
you don't have to do it almost all of
the USDA to like to register a

384
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,190
fictitious or doing business there are a
number of states that don't even require

385
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:09,210
you to register it with you can just use
it to the states to go to the County

386
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:21,840
Clerk's office with the state you are
using your business or property you

387
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,670
don't have to buy it as an individual
you can buy it through land trusts were

388
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:31,240
holding corporation that Holding
Corporation you could then have

389
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,610
registered with the fictitious name so
that's another level there but with a

390
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:41,170
Land Trust typically was shown is the
trust information for the lawyers and

391
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,150
land trusts have an added bonus the
sales price of the property

392
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,470
private estates

393
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:55,320
and what that does it makes it so your
name on the public county website I am

394
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,660
NOT a lawyer did not stay at a Holiday
Inn Express last night so the real

395
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:07,540
estate lawyer before you give setting up
we entrust Exadata you can access data

396
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:15,240
from your media files you download my
favorite tool for doing this is it works

397
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,500
on Windows Mac and Linux and the funny
thing about this tool is you don't miss

398
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:31,480
it can delete all of the mid 80 the
location data so that's what the guys

399
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:39,950
who do physics research but I also
suggest that your phones iPhones or

400
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:49,390
iPads you go into those and turn off a
lot of signs

401
00:39:49,390 --> 00:40:03,650
mask you'll be superseded sort of area
so when you use different email accounts

402
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:10,920
usernames and passwords not only does it
help checkers to check and see if you

403
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:23,840
use the same credentials across other
websites and what that is or when you

404
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:35,840
start getting spam

405
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:50,750
also being wary about services to raise
your hand but this last the fattening

406
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:57,070
one of the ways that lot of that was
released was above that they did haven't

407
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:06,170
touched that allowed into recession and
then access to information that people

408
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:12,070
download the news of celebrities in on
celebrities so when you have information

409
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:19,130
that's just for you or you and you were
in other words else that you want to

410
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:26,240
share your dick pics or whatever with
about service not only can that be

411
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,610
breached but whatever works there unless
they're doing it on your device which

412
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:39,510
was also so that's something

413
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:47,100
numbers and passwords often password
password longer but phone numbers you

414
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,040
can use a service like frame voice

415
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:59,060
those numbers as well and there's also a
number the new know anything that you

416
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:06,660
use that phone number with as then
shredded paper and mail especially if

417
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:11,460
it's that has to do with your health
information that has to do with credit

418
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,800
cards things like that

419
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:22,230
go one step further check your local
burn doing differentiated information

420
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:43,480
that time you can also post false
information

421
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:54,470
haven't actually been evidence of you
brings up that pattern of behavior that

422
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,210
people will build on you when they're
trying to talk to you

423
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:00,200
it also makes it more likely that the
information that you're building a

424
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:08,000
proposed conflicts with their findings
also reading online personas the longer

425
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:18,280
that you have different accounts and
things like that and once they start to

426
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,760
try and match profiles different
usernames email addresses there's a lot

427
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,720
of conflicting information noise
something that's very good at putting in

428
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:44,060
lots and lots of points to so even if
you were about to do it

429
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:50,299
immediate dangers you think somebody is

430
00:43:50,299 --> 00:44:06,559
now something right now there were also
no matter what time you have to go and

431
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:12,339
an investigation later later it'll
Lindell of credibility have already

432
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:16,989
document everything that happened

433
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:23,999
take screenshots backups and then if
there is no active investigation Daxing

434
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:27,069
you wanna go ahead and close down the
accounts and king of the information

435
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:53,989
that they were able to get about you now
and have some were also this is where

436
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:57,989
Brian Krebs and Ashton Kutcher had a lot
of success is they sat down and had

437
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:03,189
conversations with their local police
they had to do some education and tell

438
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:11,390
them you know is how it works and they
were able to know what happens is Brian

439
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,799
Krebs gets a call on his cell phone
whenever somebody calls on this water

440
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:27,769
temps and danger and he's able to you
know and what they've been doing is the

441
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:41,960
team to go check it out and then call
back and see whether I know I don't know

442
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,119
that's out there and I don't know all
the way so I'm definitely counting on

443
00:45:47,119 --> 00:46:35,250
you so there are and where they are
interested in knowing that if they see

444
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:59,160
somebody living life also trying to feel
better

445
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:45,810
11 when they get in on the non-emergency
line that sounds like a swimming

446
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:50,620
attempts what they'll do is they'll ask
for information about like ok where ru

447
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:57,170
what neighborhood is that the sort of
them was spotting and that are also

448
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:11,060
looking to see if that addresses and
basically thinking about what sort of

449
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:22,750
information we have is not sending out
this way this is a very recent past five

450
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:30,540
years we've seen something like four
thousand and so you know they can send a

451
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:35,390
couple of cars over to verify the
situation and that's something we see

452
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:46,010
happening just recently

453
00:48:46,010 --> 00:49:33,850
so it's the same as here and there are
ways for people with physically have

454
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:39,730
access to the digital world to have
access to that and so like really having

455
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:57,340
conversations and having been doing so
until nineteen per women and about one

456
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:03,210
part of their brain the part of the
brain that can really understand

457
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:12,450
long-term actions so 2005 just explain
to them they'll be able to make that

458
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:25,620
decision for most want to go ahead and
there are lots of software that you got

459
00:50:25,620 --> 00:51:45,240
your work and when he's okay he asked
them to build up trust them so they have

460
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,530
them there is a one size fits all answer

461
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:58,560
areas levels of militarization and
different levels I guess wanting to send

462
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:08,380
now so it's really comes down to how
about that will talk about their

463
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:18,380
percentages if they don't talk about it
and it's it really comes down to you how

464
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:34,990
attack police divers how they are or how
little there is on which the worst

465
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:40,420
offenders can find online but there
isn't a way to just say oh yes I knew

466
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:45,600
this was doing this right now I'm in
there are no more cross the border

467
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:52,340
top-down regulations or restrictions on
how often so there's no enforcement

468
00:52:52,340 --> 00:53:12,270
their communication education it's even
if you think you know
