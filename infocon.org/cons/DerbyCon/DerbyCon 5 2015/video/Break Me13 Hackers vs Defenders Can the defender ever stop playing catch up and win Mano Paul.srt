1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,480
good afternoon before I do that
everybody was probably the talk hackers

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,329
was dependent on the defender ever stop
playing catch-up and win will kind of

3
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,899
try to see if you can answer that
question but we'll do that when I get

4
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
into the topic itself

5
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,500
everyone was excited to be here at a
double con showdown at the count of

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,590
three and I'm gonna give the common 321
against a doubt we loved the loudest

7
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,180
competition that's going on a stick was
the loudest right and so we're going to

8
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:07,810
a salon as we can so everybody got the
rules and so let's go 321 where we come

9
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,330
from money runs in ball I kind of
interviews myself and I usually

10
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,229
abbreviated a monopole because it was
illegal mind we used to think that I was

11
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:21,509
actually spelled the way they felt
matter wanna pop and so it's monitor and

12
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,869
entertainment I'll try to entertain you

13
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:31,509
entertainment education and Alyssa
monopole so if you want to read about

14
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:35,340
the talk you know used that to tweet
about the talk and you say something

15
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,030
nice about me and the talk I will
retweet it if you say something bad

16
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,220
about me than we have a personal problem

17
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,370
your personal problem

18
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:52,690
anyway my primary identity is
unquestionable lower-priced up about 39

19
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,680
year that cause you know I kind of came
to realization that the things we do in

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,800
this world matters and what we leave
behind for our people kids for our

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,790
community is what really matters I'm
president we pondered how quotas hackers

22
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:14,410
or transformers surprised in 2009 about
two years ago and thank you for the

23
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,960
support we actually security to Christ
and security in Austin and there are you

24
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,790
know chapters wanting to be interested
I'm a husband or wanna be careful when I

25
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,770
say this because I speak what he bad and
I'm a husband and a father of two

26
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:36,790
because if I switch that around and his
husband of 21 my wife is going to kill

27
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:45,100
me and I love my wife got two beautiful
boys Rubin and an e-type nine years old

28
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,760
and three year old and so very thankful
to God for the gift that is and women is

29
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,100
actually about star you know you just
had his second

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,610
I had to do this because he just had his
second time I W Colin he spoke a couple

31
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:07,530
of minutes a couple of hours ago and and
he just got a thousand followers of you

32
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:29,560
doing anecdotal allegorical kind of way
of looking at secure software itself

33
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,690
like a professional which is used for D
exam with eyes closed so the person

34
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,480
second edition of that book and then I
was before the world security is charged

35
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,230
so many islands and I came into the
world of security from the islands and

36
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,460
that's a different story that we could
talk about you or something you know how

37
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,870
I made that transition and so I was
shocked biologists and now I'm security

38
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,570
professional I kind of look at it from
the standpoint of their shots at sea and

39
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:06,160
in the shops online it's actually easier
to identify the shots at sea because you

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,000
know kind of similar for the most part
but the socks on land that we have to

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,170
deal with it for us to know sometimes
identified that is in a nutshell and

42
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,640
then terms of the training offerings my
company provides a kind of projects

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,550
mostly on application security building
secure software and kind of that's one

44
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,390
of the things that are looking at in the
context of this talk from a perspective

45
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,940
for managers and executives are
resilient applications and I should be

46
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:41,960
done in one day classic music on jeans a
few somebody from the Canadian and you

47
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,849
can actually see that and check out my
department as well

48
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:51,639
dance music on so I want to talk I
talked with his coat was if anyone's

49
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,939
going to help us

50
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:57,149
beefed up our cyber defenses it's going
to be the hackers that know what it is

51
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:03,249
like to play offense and it actually
comes from an article when i search for

52
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:07,860
the article why do we suck at the
cybersecurity this was a second article

53
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,199
that came to the USA government sucks
and that's not enough to go into that

54
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,619
but about cybersecurity but the second
article actually talk about you know why

55
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:19,969
is that the type of its gonna get much
much more

56
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:25,139
and one of the one of the observations
of the author actually rights and that

57
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,919
is that if you really want to get the
upper hand as a dependent then you've

58
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,249
got to learn to be able to go to the
offenders in Vegas right meaning to hire

59
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,729
a car mines it and so will be able to do
what it's like to play that opens itself

60
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:45,099
so how many of you would deem yourself
as hackers are dwelling on the seal a

61
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:50,659
deal that I caused the matrix give you a
weekly and few others how many of you

62
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:58,699
buddy missile as defenders of a company
called exercise is you get a raise our

63
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:01,249
hands one way or the other it's mutually
exclusive

64
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:10,669
ok if you say so how many of you would
say that you're defending organizations

65
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:20,110
or companies like good how many of you
defend those want to be how goes ok how

66
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,669
many of those 12 be defenders now I
don't ask you if you are mad at want to

67
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,529
be single that significant

68
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:32,279
it's only thing goes so many of the time
to look at it from a hike of some point

69
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,989
we don't want to defend those who is
really to be able to break stuff right

70
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:39,599
and to be able to see how systems are
exploitable not however defended his

71
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,449
going to play both sides of the chess
game and so it's important to look at it

72
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,139
now the hacking White said that most of
the house gonna be different is because

73
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,409
we have in the media this whole kind of
you know a proton this attitude that

74
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:58,669
hacking sexy and even that's not only if
you agree with me on that show pants

75
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:04,389
discontent actually best explains that a
guy who's coming with china mug this

76
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,499
this guy was in the suit and it comes
with a knife and the other guy goes oh

77
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:14,649
so there's any put out his gun and then
his girlfriend or wife and I put out his

78
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:18,049
gun alongside him and she goes and then
it's like the guy was actually the

79
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:21,129
mother comes and say this is so
embarrassing that the kind of almost got

80
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:26,219
mugged himself and the lady kind of 60
like the people's will ever report right

81
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:28,809
side deepens so that's the problem

82
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:34,759
papers in the media reports exploits and
things that are successful from a breed

83
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,029
standpoint but actually did something
good when was the last time you said

84
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:45,169
that this company did not get breached
because they had such good defenses have

85
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,539
you ever know but that's kind of
something that we don't go back and say

86
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:54,439
it was a defendant can you really stop
playing catch-up and win for this

87
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,109
purpose of this talk I take the stance
of a defender and my son and I Bieber

88
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:04,149
Justin just has to about three weeks ago
but our second degree black belt and one

89
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:09,479
of the things that I she actually always
tells us is that when you want to bite

90
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,139
you always have to do two things in a
spot the first thing on your mind

91
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:19,859
completely don't think about the spark
because the best fighter is a counter

92
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:23,579
fighter so you have your eye contact you
make sure your position it could be

93
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:27,550
politically correct with your laptop it
stands you know you kind of

94
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,750
read the other person and the new
counter fight and martial arts funding

95
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,440
so you kind of know what I'm talking
about with you counter fight because you

96
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,230
gain the advantage because actually
trying to put the opponent in their

97
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,290
place but they don't know what you're
going to react or how you gonna be

98
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,380
flexible stance on attacking a deep and
slow so I'm going to take that I love

99
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,180
scored by by Bruce Lee but he says the
best fighters not not a box not a

100
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,720
correct amount to judo man he's the one
who's able to adapt to the situation so

101
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,650
the guy who's coming to boxing he's not
attack by giving a strong kick the one

102
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,100
who's coming to you with a kick back
between Judah man and the guys coming to

103
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,440
you with a June attack while tonight
it's because it's closer in fighting the

104
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,650
one that you can fight so in terms of
defender but it is important for us to

105
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,000
know can be really win because the
defendants by default accident has

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,990
advantages and those who actually raise
your hands for being the defendant in

107
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:33,200
the different approach even say that you
can actually deal with truly love how

108
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,960
many of you have to deal with
sarbanes-oxley financial trading on the

109
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,630
gramm-leach-bliley Act financial and
that's why we have so many compliance

110
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:47,950
and if you notice the wood pain as in
the World Cup lines but I would like is

111
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,490
also in the one complains often do you
want to light you ought to try to get

112
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,280
away from this animation and so we have
to constantly kind of trying to get this

113
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,710
money if you being in audit meeting
compliance auditor was auditing the

114
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:08,280
control evidence in your organization
hands up of those are being in that

115
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,459
situation have you seen the movie snakes
on a plane

116
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:19,860
now I don't have anything against it but
he often feeling that you gotta jump out

117
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,800
of the plane I know you guys have taken
my slut because you don't know unless

118
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,769
you told me you can't put in Saxon but
so that's kind of a situation where you

119
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:32,740
can jump out at you can actually be in
as well so we have this challenge of

120
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,290
having to constantly tried to drive a
security for the reasons of compliance

121
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,399
but compliance not security you do
proper security you would be complying

122
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,740
with its not the other way around then
talking about functionality when it

123
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,110
comes down to actually building security
was functionality functionality Troms

124
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,319
security almost all the time right

125
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,740
the businesses out of the something
wrong with that game and I'm not talking

126
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,309
about Donald Trump right politician

127
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:08,889
possibly future president but enjoy the
debates DSC the debates it is

128
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:15,970
entertainment is very nice and Social
Security often get stuff left behind on

129
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,149
the sidelines and then the other mistake
that most organizations are made with

130
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:25,569
regard to security in order to address
cybersecurity and issues what is the

131
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:32,009
first thing the luxury going by some to
save money go go buy some to land so

132
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:38,139
investing a problem in the people that
go by a 2982 lot of food centric

133
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:43,850
approach becomes a problem because
people are the weakest link when I talk

134
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,110
about people of the week was named why
don't why under the weakest weakest link

135
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:54,360
trust and so in order for the defender
to ever to win

136
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,620
what are some of the things we can do in
other words what I'm asking is if

137
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:05,050
hacking a sexy difference I also came to
the stalking the Ausable some of the

138
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,440
other speakers and other folks as well
and I said come to depend on Everest

139
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:15,060
without batting an eye doctor said no I
was like that's on the Promiseland talk

140
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,209
though because this is something that is
different so can actually increase to

141
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:26,779
hear that some of you pls it can be and
it will be in the talks so the attitude

142
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:32,120
that most about is that a car had the
advantage depending on what are some of

143
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,860
the reasons without one to say that the
attacker there's another paper the rules

144
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,300
of engagement but as a defendant has to
play by the rules of engagement by the

145
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,790
time I was seeking to enter into one
entry point where the defendant us to

146
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,180
dot every single entry point that I will
acquire would talk to them and they want

147
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,760
to and the defender has to be a
vigilante 24 by seven saves somebody

148
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:59,570
asked you a question of the depend on
how to use what's going on so you can

149
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:09,250
actually do to get away from this every
two hours I get up and try out the city

150
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:19,899
and so when it comes down to the Michael
Hamid both he actually from Microsoft he

151
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,180
actually kind of a tax advantage of the
defendants dilemma and it was recently

152
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,610
the thing about the attacks about it was
different about this entry points in the

153
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:33,350
vicinity aspect of it and we all know
from despite minute popular he actually

154
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,360
came back and he said I don't like this
afternoon but that's a defeatist

155
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,560
you know it's a defeatist attitude and
Michael responded by saying that it's

156
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,329
really not a defeatist attitude I'm not
trying to say that the debate that it's

157
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:52,079
all for the defenders with digital
religion and vigilant and so I kind of

158
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,399
agree with both of them I agree with
Robert Michael in terms of what the

159
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,480
analysis but actually add even more with
another friend of mine part Sampson

160
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:09,339
right from these groups have you guys up
and with that he had to respond by

161
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:14,360
saying I don't think it's really about
defeating or not it's really about a

162
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,910
different mindset just a different
mindset so what we really need to stop

163
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,820
playing catch-up and win is if the
defender you know has a different

164
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,810
mindset so people may be the weakest
link but they can be the strongest

165
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:34,529
difference if and only if the trained
and educated about how types of tools

166
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:48,510
and techniques but so we look at how
types what motivates a hacker so money

167
00:14:48,510 --> 00:15:19,860
financial gain is it important for us to
to know these will see that in a minute

168
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,470
but from the hacker types of the money
to be cool it's actually some of these

169
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:33,829
said they might be directly attributed
to intellect and the Union raining and

170
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:39,089
failing to realize a common sense may
not be so it's not that they have been

171
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:43,889
selected I don't disagree with that at
all now but the driver but he's also

172
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:50,980
mention fun to do so it's easy to make
stuff and if you go and put try to put

173
00:15:50,980 --> 00:16:02,040
it in the Lego blocks without really
having to stop the dozens of things but

174
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,870
how easy it is to break something that
you

175
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:10,700
instructions so they kind of do it for
fun and famously the other one was

176
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:17,300
somebody mentioned financial forecasts
driver in this case we had in terms of

177
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,630
the type of sick was either prime
service economy an article that was

178
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,360
published in 2008 by the Harvard
Business Review actually at that point

179
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,200
in time said was 1.5 billion dollars
this is talking about the Norton

180
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,600
cybercrime report in 2011 reported it
was a three hundred and thirty eight

181
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:43,150
billion dollars in cyber crime that is a
huge money pot right now it's a

182
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,200
fantastic article actually asked you to
go to rebuild the bills because it's

183
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,240
important for you to kind of know what
it is with financial gain essentially as

184
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,680
the driver the other type of hackers
hackers somebody was trying to promote

185
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,040
an agenda of propaganda trying to you
know delivered a message of doing

186
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,459
something because it's really not fame
or money it's not really financial gain

187
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,410
but they want to deliver a message they
want to do it really strong and not

188
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,170
quite so they could be in tunnel so an
internal would be a disgruntled employee

189
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,910
who's not very happy with the company
with the logic bomb in his system so

190
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,319
hows once in a closet I was teaching and
I said so how would you define a bomb

191
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,709
went off by students actually responded
on so logic bomb is a going away present

192
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:33,100
that the employee gives them right
because they can do damage and they have

193
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,410
access to the internal court said before
they leave so it could be an internal

194
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:43,720
and external finance really

195
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,750
anonymity and so famous now the driver's
control these against your organization

196
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:56,710
so it's important for the country bears
was kind of a military advantage now

197
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,090
that actually is a pretty cool picture
it talks about nuclear technology but

198
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,790
today's cyber threat and the guy the
question is what will be the water

199
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,860
guardian of the future look like and the
guy in the back with a laptop saying yo

200
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,250
dude but that's kind of the pic to elude
dealing with because somebody who

201
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,560
control the bits and bytes and actually
tone on tone often do not connected and

202
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,000
disconnected so we kind of have to deal
with these folks often rely on ABC's

203
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,050
good fats and dealt with as opposed to
as opposed to just the things that bring

204
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,070
the big now what is important to
recognize most of these dealt with in

205
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,560
this apt to go back and dissected you
would find out that many of the time

206
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,910
these attacks and other organizations
with many common attacks but that's a

207
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,870
good news as to how common attacks work
that would be able to protect against

208
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,760
you know even serious threats so why did
why is it important to understand the

209
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,110
Titanic's understanding of threat
profile as defenders how to defend and

210
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,580
protect against them and kind of you
look at the art of war or the outside or

211
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,830
in this case knowing your enemy right
you know inside enemy is equally

212
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,540
important as knowing yourself and
control systems and software that's

213
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:13,429
right now with the tools they need to be
educated as well so watch what does so

214
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:16,990
we have a kind of look at most of the
tools you can use destroyed a lien on

215
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:23,480
those exploit frameless Metasploit be
custom scripts that they would like to

216
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,490
have their own tool bag in terms of what
they would use now what is happening

217
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,790
this they use a set of weaponry to gain
access into our systems and software to

218
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,510
bridge our organizations well what are
the tools that are there in the hands of

219
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:47,580
the development staff you don't bring a
knife to a gunfight so we want to defend

220
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,050
but we really going with knives and
gunfights right now there are certain

221
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,450
situations right in the kids when I
would tell you if you take a knife to a

222
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:01,740
gunfight you gonna have a bad time
unless you bring a gun to a knife fight

223
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:09,760
and you stop them was really fast and
you got to be right now if that's you

224
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,679
know if you've got any past or if not
the first to attack then you gotta make

225
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:22,110
sure that you have a really big knife
you guys know what movie this is from

226
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,480
that's not a nice

227
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,240
this is a nice you don't go take a box
cutter to a knife fight also what you

228
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,390
gonna do like them and they don't cut
through it doesn't look so you take the

229
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:42,610
right tools for the job by chance if you
do end up winning in the situation you

230
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:50,290
bring a knife to a gunfight annually
within you got a problem the important

231
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,730
thing is that we take the right tools
for the job so can DEP teams be given

232
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,390
security who's this is a problem that we
have opened up to face because you have

233
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,320
to answer the questions like can you
really give you a definite panties that

234
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:10,610
we had that situation in our
organization so can I really give these

235
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,450
give my dad so what happens as in most
cases they will say no I actually say

236
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,940
you need to keep your dads with security
tools taking into account a few things

237
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,490
the first and foremost regulations of
the land right leg and sudden country's

238
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:38,970
policy now given that aside if you
actually have to have some of the depth

239
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,900
that I would use then you could you
should only do that if you have a profit

240
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,520
organization mentioned that the majority
aspect the common problem software

241
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,810
development security processes that need
to be in place having a problem process

242
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,460
and you have that done in a controlled
environment so that when we go to train

243
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,800
for our weapons that we use in our
classes what we end up doing is we had

244
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
asked to actually go to the moon and as
we don't get a bottle by two tests are

245
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,260
open seven different so we see you go to
a public school

246
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,070
and that's when we test because you know
it's bad and you make sure they don't

247
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,900
offend anybody as part of the training
it's a difference in a controlled

248
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,540
environment we need to do the same
within our organization and of course

249
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,340
majority of good to know people
utilities as the mature enough to be

250
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,620
able to make sure when you give them
systems that they don't run with his

251
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,360
parents right now what do you what do
kids to even give them says another

252
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,060
daughter on so rights because what
happens is if you give the pool of the

253
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:43,520
tool is still up food and this is what
he would have right now is not the right

254
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,040
tool for the job and give them the
appropriate Tues so talk about how can

255
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:54,340
two techniques so what does this do to
actually had to do in other words why

256
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:01,600
are most applications so if you actually
go back to the boat this was actually

257
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,320
the this was the Verizon the data from
the boat to give it to the database

258
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,240
support that Verizon published if you
notice it can be prevented

259
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,750
so that the summer break down somewhere
and that it also talked about how the

260
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,970
top four attacks actually talked about
humans as being the main reasons why the

261
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:28,470
attacks were even possible by so in
applications reasons for it to get had

262
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,420
movies and porn application and
basically broken down into designer

263
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,620
shoes court issues a people issues but
what design shoes how many of you threat

264
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,920
model in your organization so you've
done that morning let me ask you this

265
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,560
question in some cases may not even
exist in kids but it is existent it's

266
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,000
inadequate

267
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,660
you don't go up to the level of you
really need to ever have a prototype

268
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,780
model you cannot and that's okay at
least talk but often the problem in the

269
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,000
morning exercise within companies is the
fact that you do it as a one-time

270
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,360
activity and then it doesn't become a
living document throughout the lifecycle

271
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,740
of that system that often to get double
up until it happens we've done the top

272
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,060
model for the sake of threat warning its
check dog so the best way to actually

273
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,660
explain that is if you have a treadmill
if you have a treadmill

274
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,750
how many of you use the treadmill ago

275
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,820
into becoming just a tad model that's up
to you than you expect us to be but if

276
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,850
you don't use the treatment of told the
same thing if you don't use it anymore

277
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:36,550
model to other life cycle then you have
to give you insight into logic laws laws

278
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,430
that are not as a court's entry but
logical issues with a business now white

279
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:49,540
internet motto how goes to add more to
the application to any know what he was

280
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,380
trying to protect what do you enjoy and
exit points on the debt money from a

281
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,550
design standpoint the court standpoint
as well we have some issues if you look

282
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:03,960
at this grab it kind of comes the
technique does putting it as from 2015

283
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,530
published it kind of comes out to say
that most of it is actually over tax

284
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:13,180
valuation things that we can actually go
back and look now if I say this we kind

285
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,310
of hit about business and pleasure boats
me hear about it when we go through in

286
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,500
you know of any breaches announced or
something but the question is not

287
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:27,260
important as much to know off the
attackers to know as soon as it is to

288
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,420
know why the attack was even possible
now many of the times when I want

289
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:39,240
awkward up teams and companies but I
asked them about jackson also yes yes

290
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,380
you know really what happens and see
section and then you get this blank

291
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,300
stare right like what really happened
what is happening above above it all

292
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,360
flows from the time that you know
computing stop it I guess but those are

293
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,370
the best thing is to demonstrate his
show because many people even in the

294
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,760
hacking community have heard about the
clothes but not seem really what happens

295
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,960
under the covers the whole about single
injection and not really seen what

296
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:13,260
happens I'll see if I can get through a
couple of Dennis here

297
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:42,630
and program runs on the Windows 2007 or
later they have it by deep old and then

298
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:50,690
cuddles pays 22 points 66 Linux I think
they have it turned on you can kind of

299
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,900
actually go and see where it is you can
go in Linux can go to the condo and see

300
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:04,050
if it has turned on and if the default
it's turned on so you really want to

301
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:15,350
turn that off and leave it up to its
electric doesn't overflow when I put it

302
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:24,600
in debug mode to see you so in an
account that a veto on that so I kind of

303
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:44,680
turned up at is allowed and now in this
I have a simple script which is the same

304
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,300
function the head of violence and then
I'm gonna do in its main function take

305
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,960
some arguments in

306
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,630
updated about four was about forty you
guys do mmm papi into the buffer 2010

307
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,130
and then the strangling the dot will
develop as a musical putting

308
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,840
entire string that is put into the
buffets and I'm going to end up above us

309
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:17,140
that's all that does is really simple
function and so I'll just call it well

310
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:25,679
4:04 demo and so I have a bottle for
dental and if I now send it anything

311
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:39,950
it's going to copy into the buffer if
it's going to be in 2008 just pointed

312
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:47,669
out now what happens if I do the same
thing but instead of sending in a low

313
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:49,549
book W O

314
00:28:49,549 --> 00:29:09,149
ice and it lets you think about
something else wouldn't you but I could

315
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:11,830
actually do that also in terms of
scripts and I could do that in terms of

316
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:30,290
kryptonite to sing in 2009 actually
finding out is invited by dawn

317
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:38,720
and its do that three times I printed it
three times i've go back and actually

318
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:47,080
doing that forty times forty times the
size of the voters 48th so if I go print

319
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,720
and slow doing forty I do actually
that's it for 200 I get a segmentation

320
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,000
fault now at that point

321
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,180
something's gone wrong with it so don't
know what it is going to go look at it

322
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,820
from seeing if I can actually make it
over when I go more than what I think

323
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,620
it's actually more than a segmentation
fault about four thousand times in the

324
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,870
character I get the aircon depends about
that as I also had a vision for quite a

325
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,770
bit so what happened is this something
that's gone wrong so it's because into

326
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:24,270
actually a debug mode and it loads
basically the symbols enzyme in debug

327
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,170
mode and what I can do is interacting on
this program and see what is happening

328
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:46,650
inside in the register so I go into the
same function may be disassembled to me

329
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:56,920
because I don't put big fall break point
in this when I just a simple to me you

330
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:03,010
wouldn't know it is that the men copy
function is instruction set 58 from the

331
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:10,360
stop the programs but a break then the
main + 58 I want to see what the values

332
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,630
in the register before the before the
actual you didn't into some good one

333
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:20,010
break point there but I also want to be
able to before tax returns and puts the

334
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,190
program I want to see the values and
that is gonna do another baby

335
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:32,809
eighty which leaves the programs or do a
break and so the two break points right

336
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:46,720
now and so when I run this program it's
got a break at those break points and it

337
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,940
reads break point one now looking
interact interactively into the distance

338
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:57,600
you notice that the base point and the
stack pointer you have just paid was

339
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,190
about it out to space because the engine
to copy it hasn't taken place this is

340
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,509
the break point before actually took
place so you have D 2d 02904 the

341
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:12,629
basement and the stack pointer now if
you go back and continue the program so

342
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:18,809
wanted to copy it had break point too
but let's go back and see the biggest US

343
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,580
has actually done anything at all

344
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,389
it still keeps that because it hasn't
yet done that we haven't seen the woods

345
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:34,539
segmentation fault it so I've got a
single step through this program and so

346
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:37,350
I'm single stepping into the program to
see what's now taking place now the

347
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,049
buffer is getting the one who is not
getting live in the Buffaloes away

348
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:48,570
interactively looking at it the basic
point he is no longer be to tease you

349
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,149
know because internally what has
happened as the value that I passed in

350
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:59,820
as quoted in the face with his ex parte
1 is 41 and then the hex values 2011

351
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,220
does so we actually Allwood Road the
baddest pointers I attacker knows that

352
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,980
if you don't do that in addition to new
products to England checks before you

353
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,970
pop it into the buffer you actually see
they can actually go but I did and then

354
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:19,169
pointed to an address space that they
have the malicious code of the payload

355
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:21,920
size of any kind of go under the covers
and see what's happening

356
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,860
you cannot see what's really taking
place in terms of the attacker be able

357
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,780
to be in a bad system in public sex
right now of course he has said he

358
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,270
thinks that you should be using it so
you don't have this and you can also

359
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,160
realize that sometimes on the heirs
allowed itself did execute improvements

360
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,070
and/or the exercise of stock protection
you know your thoughts in the US so

361
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:47,920
that's one part of the attack to
demonstrate that this from windows and

362
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:54,940
we've heard about single injection and I
did so I'm a website human rights in

363
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:00,840
this website I'm building with my son to
help him learn about security and then

364
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,690
it goes kind of so this working on some
of these attacks and so what happens to

365
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:10,040
leave behind the covers off an injection
attack if you have an obligation to try

366
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:17,440
to sign an anybody want to give me your
username and password for no way you can

367
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:43,640
trust me that's fine as well as
passengers what women go at some kind of

368
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,410
basic things in terms of you know this
could be a bank application it could be

369
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:53,880
done but he was asked to login so in
terms of testing putting to put an

370
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,330
injection of that one of the things we
do is we check to see if it isn't just

371
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:02,460
about to it and a possibly or 11 attack
and it's been quite actually takes place

372
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,280
so you sign in and it did bypass
authentication and it gave me bruises

373
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:14,660
means account so just enough to win an
event to go you kind of looking at it or

374
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:21,150
else I can do with this and somebody was
kind of a little bit depth with the got

375
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,980
two pretty ladies

376
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:32,760
and go back go back and say I can try
having one of the user application gives

377
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,380
back and edit and it tells you that the
user to user ID is invalid because it's

378
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,550
not dead in a goodbye plus the others
being a bit absolutely would not be

379
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,180
right if you don't handle it directly
then you're going to see this to you now

380
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:53,420
see many applications when it comes out
the other law that only in place so now

381
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,190
I see this now it tells me though it's
very kind to tell me that you didn't buy

382
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:08,619
the user IDs so if I go out and do by
using I D and I cited by User ID even

383
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:16,050
two predominant comes a user login so
you can actually used by you that idea

384
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:23,200
that's cool but user login as well as a
passive

385
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:30,080
doing this kind of abuse to get all the
columns on the database so he's kind of

386
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:37,140
coming in so because of time he's gonna
do by User ID and see this really make

387
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:45,450
it a regular is about to go by using a
user password username

388
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:50,760
no date created what are the common side
as you go to an enumerator now I've done

389
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:59,390
this before so I'm just copy that and it
pays to ensure

390
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:11,859
right but we gotta go back and check to
see if there's anybody can develop a

391
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:15,750
plug-in said you could use but you can
pick one the plugin and you can save a

392
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:24,560
move on and this gets another movie
maximum length of the plugin and I can

393
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,180
go back in and type of not being able to
do 10 nothing really happened because it

394
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,530
entertains me actually have gone through
all the columns in the database so what

395
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:40,460
really happen as we going through this
kind of looking at your internal system

396
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,480
just by looking at other messages and of
seeing what's happening behind the get

397
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,109
to the whole bottom but why was this
even possible but before we even get to

398
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:52,599
that what to do with this rather than
actually looking at just nine names of

399
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:59,740
calling just do a drop table users in
the demo 1 continue to ride it doesn't

400
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,410
he did not have service but that could
be dangerous if you have an injection

401
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:07,119
phone application that can drop table
accounts of users about them but to what

402
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,859
end up happening then as you go back and
say I'm really not interested in just

403
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:17,130
the data behind it so you try to select
the user login from the user table right

404
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,530
and see what the data type is or if I
select all columns of the user and

405
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,210
trying to be using it was better than
the first user recorded there is no

406
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,530
sorted by a an administrator or so
they're trying to see if they can find

407
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:35,230
that information is just going and
getting you select user logon and the

408
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,800
reason we do a union is to make sure
that you won't have another record set

409
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,190
in union with so we want to see that and
then you take a user login what did it

410
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:51,200
do you think as a user login a numeric
datatype string of God given you a

411
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,220
mathematical operation on a numeric
datatype you wanna see the impact of the

412
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:15,160
effect that it was unable to convert
data type type was right so now you

413
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:21,200
actually have the user login BWA but and
so if you go back and then see what the

414
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:31,660
next thing that you would think he would
do get me the user the user login with

415
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:50,250
user login is

416
00:39:50,250 --> 00:40:06,990
the Bruce Wayne's a kind of anyone would
most likely orgy do something with this

417
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,790
agency the script will declare a
temporary table and passwords and

418
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,780
accounts and passwords into the
temporary table and basically do at a

419
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,410
cost of lube and then you'll be able to
see all the different usernames and

420
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:24,900
passwords but why didn't really take
place why did this happen if you go back

421
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:33,070
to a presentation by perot plays Stack
Overflow right individually overbroad

422
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:38,330
above are itself so it cannot handle it
in such an anatomy in the code was

423
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:43,160
really to build equated dynamically
taking user input I was he this way when

424
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:49,630
they were expecting something to happen
inputs 1 2011 Double Dash and that

425
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:54,860
basically changed and puts that into the
the text comes out when the baby comes

426
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:01,500
from user name is nobody just ask Randy
strength of 10 2010 and ending up to the

427
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,450
Double Dash gets so what happens as he
basically got back to a condition but it

428
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:16,590
came back as to whether they want to go
into one is that one is 121 but in that

429
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:21,170
situation because of them back to haiti
that was conducted injected in by

430
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:26,130
supplying and use a data-type userdata
as if it was just data to back an

431
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:32,830
independent injured as a commander so
you may be asking what about why I said

432
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,780
that as a dependent we do code review we
actually gone through this process and

433
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:42,510
the same number again yet applications
are injectable or chrome to attacks so

434
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:51,140
what's the problem report abuse you have
to make court not Dakota

435
00:41:51,140 --> 00:42:02,060
but often think of any person in terms
of its my baby so the kind of taking

436
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,740
something an open mind to fix the
petition was the kind of take a

437
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:11,170
defensive stats and quarter of you often
becomes kind of an instance of it being

438
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,120
an internal processes kind of as an
add-on activity in many organizations

439
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,150
and so we gotta go back and make sure
that is integral to the part of the

440
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:26,810
whole process it's not an inspection of
course in most companies do an audit all

441
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:32,140
this offered a lifecycle processes and
they'll say be doing what he would

442
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:41,460
really get is kind of a tool check my
weed understood things most of the times

443
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:49,400
those things don't get really fully
fixed so it's all going back issues with

444
00:42:49,400 --> 00:43:03,000
that and so why do you need to do just
what I could do it as juicy as you but

445
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:11,500
right now of course as people issues the
defender profile no one in my experience

446
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,110
of over a decade and information
security and opportunity has been as

447
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:22,040
this we often taken securities savvy
security people and tried to put them

448
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,910
into a developer mindset right to be
able to protect our systems and software

449
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,020
in the world we live in

450
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,250
it's two different profiles because
developers are intended to bring

451
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:37,210
building's security folks have time to
break things so far as to hire a good

452
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:42,470
security professional dev team but it
does it does it depend on its better to

453
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,360
actually go to the development staff and
bring them in and train them in security

454
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,100
because they're not a built-up already
so it's easy for them to not a big stop

455
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,510
so it's something to keep in mind as you
go back and look at what

456
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:58,110
schools and you know communication
abilities it's also important for them

457
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:01,440
to know content and content knowledge in
terms of programming and in terms of

458
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,330
this offer will always be easier to have
the human rights so this is an example

459
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:14,370
so you'd see twenty basically go back
and you put your Twitter login and I

460
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:20,110
just one but many many times failing to
recognize that the school website but

461
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:24,420
they just been looking at because we get
so June to the world system that we are

462
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,940
in we don't see the other peripherals
and so we often get caught with

463
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,520
applications getting mad because they
are in the blind spots right and hiking

464
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,130
the human whatever you do don't be like
this and with this I will conclude its

465
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,510
actually a video I didn't put sound on
this trying to plug something in the

466
00:44:41,510 --> 00:45:03,240
oversight

467
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:58,530
people as a defendant it's going to be
going taking into consideration

468
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:04,030
techniques like that I could would try
to model like the system quoted you like

469
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:09,780
that I can report abuse and Green Bay be
trained and educated think and act like

470
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:17,160
a girl because your options is really
your best defense but so without side

471
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,470
I'm getting the four-minute time check
so you like this presentation are you do

472
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,760
not like this presentation and an encore
presentation be accompanied have

473
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,710
security program development needs of
any training event is needs then contact

474
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:36,930
me my email security solutions are
common otherwise have a bless day and

475
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:42,950
thank you stop playing catch-up and when
the mindsets thank you very much
