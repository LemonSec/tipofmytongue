1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,770
alright we'll get started

2
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:27,529
slide decks on slideshare.net you can
read about 200 skipper me afterwards so

3
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:34,920
go ahead and get started just my
standard disclaimers is as is don't test

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,160
and production not responsible if you
brick a few machines so this is not a

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,250
Microsoft sells pets I don't work for
Microsoft this just set realistic

6
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,890
expectations for organizations all of my
group policy slides were taken from a

7
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,070
test p.m. network called Derby Conn I'm
just gonna morning right now my slide

8
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:03,649
deck surprise worse than national
security agencies so my talk is really

9
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:08,450
kind of broken up into four separate
parts are going to be talking about

10
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,660
identity protection data protection
threat resistance and device security

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:22,090
really paying more of a focus on the
unique things in Windows 10 sadly some

12
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,270
of the things that are being touted in
Windows 10 are only available and

13
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,810
Enterprise versions of Windows 10
singing need active Software Assurance

14
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,200
licenses that kind of stuff to actually
get something is features in an

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,530
enterprise device protection that
something Microsoft has not dropped yet

16
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,250
out to the public so they eventually
well as more of a data leak protection

17
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,420
if people are emailing all files that
they aren't supposed to be stuff like

18
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,550
that so I saw the other unfortunate
thing is I i get into somebody's slide

19
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,470
decks especially if you decide to use
like passport

20
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,620
organization you're going to have an
active Active Directory Federation

21
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,850
system in an act of PKI environment if
you wanna start utilizing some out stop

22
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,350
depending on how your organization is
really kind of so I'm not going to get

23
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,460
into this this is a free tool called
Microsoft Security Compliance Manager

24
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,050
you can download it it's free

25
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,630
some of my belt locker sections are
really kind of based off of SCM supply

26
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,470
modified maybe a little bit but if
you're wanting to get into security base

27
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:42,510
lining and just start out this is a
great tool to truly download and get

28
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,760
into the other thing I'm not going to
get into but it is available it was

29
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:56,230
actually published and June of this past
year it's called Microsoft laps so if

30
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,340
you have administrator accounts are
enabled in your environment and you wish

31
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,310
to rotate them and for some reason or
another you just don't want to disable

32
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,380
them this is totally gonna check out to
that supported by Microsoft that all

33
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,410
those securely rotate passwords in your
organization so first thing I'm gonna

34
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:21,570
get started with this Microsoft passport
passport is meant to replace passwords

35
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,430
with 2010 occasion so basically you're
enrolling advice with the windows pen

36
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,500
and you have the option to force the use
of a hardware security device such as a

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,840
TPM chip when you're setting up your
policies once I start getting into these

38
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,980
you're probably gonna noticed a passport
Windows hello may not be practical

39
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:52,140
fruits for something or get your your
your organization's environment so this

40
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,650
is just one of those things just kind of
pay attention to be aware so one of the

41
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,080
first things and I'm sorry this is
really blurry again you can download my

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,810
slide decks afterwards so get your gay
couple choices if you want to keep pace

43
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,850
that then occasion or if you want to do
certificate based authentication

44
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:19,030
while if you're in a surety environment
keep a stiff indication is relatively

45
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,900
easy to set up but if you start moving
into organizations that are you want to

46
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,470
do

47
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,460
Active Directory on Prem dan you're
gonna need a 2016 domain controller

48
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,430
along with System Center are two
Configuration Manager and ETFs on top of

49
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,920
all that as soon as you start rolling
this out and then you know they fell

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,740
into the slide gets more in Azure ADC
subscriptions if you run an azure ed

51
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,060
hybrid environment you know some bad
stuff requires more Vicky PKI

52
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,520
infrastructure so one of the one of the
biggest things when you're setting up

53
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,080
passport policies you do have the option
to use hardware security device you can

54
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,180
force users to use Microsoft passport
for work as soon as they sign in for

55
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,160
Windows 10 device for the first time you
can set minimum Penn links can set six-a

56
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,990
however however much you want to really
set it just be aware they are setting up

57
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,390
a pen so whenever you're indicating into
your Active Directory environment it's

58
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:38,660
using tokenization to actually connected
to a D so if if you cut your your PIN

59
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,530
links shorts a six characters that
attackers still gonna need the physical

60
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:49,570
device before they can actually log in
as that user so this is really just kind

61
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,570
of a breakdown of how this works

62
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:59,430
a user unlocks the workstation or they
had roll into a brand new device and

63
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,390
they kind of get an out of the box
experience identity provider and I'm

64
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,800
gonna show you the Syrian minute whether
its Azure Active Directory its gonna

65
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,980
dump out in a dedication to continue and
then

66
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:19,810
with regards to Internet sources if you
use a DFS its gonna help you single

67
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,960
sign-on into those types of areas so one
of the first things that you get into

68
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,830
whenever you get into an out of the box
experience says it's gonna ask you

69
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,020
whether your device belongs to an
organization and this is this example is

70
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:42,270
just using the most simplistic one which
is as ur so I'm gonna join on my Azure

71
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,070
ed environment and the next thing it's
going to ask me is hey you need to

72
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,330
create a work plan ok how do you want to
create this work because I need to

73
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:59,960
identify who you are so I'm gonna select
to send a notification by 10 Decatur out

74
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,470
and all this is kind of an azure so it
already knows who I am I blogged in with

75
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:12,500
Microtek correct credentials and azure
and then it brings my phone with my

76
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,510
authenticator app and it says okay did
he go ahead and approve this request it

77
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:27,160
except ok I've just i just i just
properly identified myself with another

78
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,730
personal I guess device if you will in
order to create a work so I'm gonna set

79
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:40,490
up my pen that's based upon my group
policies and that's gonna be done so in

80
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,750
a nutshell that's that's how Microsoft
passport works so if you decide to roll

81
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,910
out something like that just be aware
that there's other some there's a ton of

82
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:56,380
other stuff involved with it as well so
I'm going over some fascinating

83
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,720
deadlines to a quick about encrypting
data because encrypting data absolutely

84
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,830
pisses me off when I see some of these
basic things that organizations can do

85
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,500
to stop some of this from happening
whether it's a laptop that was stolen

86
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,840
from a car and an employee decided to
withdraw some social security numbers so

87
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,070
that they could just kind of workout
from home or what not and then the

88
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,720
laptop get stolen and

89
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,550
and then there's just a whole other set
of things that go on motion on top of

90
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:37,760
this so same deal with stolen thumb
drives they get data copied remote you

91
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,659
know physically from the device and then
the user takes a home they forget about

92
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,530
it they lose it and the airport but not
this kind of stuff you can actually

93
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,170
protect with BitLocker with Windows Ted
he actually been do it from Windows 8

94
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:58,150
Windows 7 enterprise enterprise came
with BitLocker some kind of I'm going

95
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:04,940
kind of expand on some of those this is
prime my favorite when we get FBI

96
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,530
anti-terrorist officials that are saying
we should prevent encryption above all

97
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:17,510
else is just absolutely silly so as
organizations migrate to Windows 10 pro

98
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:24,170
or enterprise there you know you guys
there there's others in current full

99
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,030
disk encryption solutions that are out
there because I think orientations are

100
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:34,330
going to be very I guess more adoptive
of Windows 10 Pro sense they they've

101
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,100
changed a lot of things that user she
stated in that type of environment but

102
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,460
lockers natively available if you have
legal opera obligations to report on

103
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,110
encryption you're gonna need products
such as like him but there's other

104
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,900
products out there like that they can
report on encryption statuses of devices

105
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,329
so if you have a legal obligation where
you need to prove that that device was

106
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,710
encrypted you're gonna have to add some
other stuff into this mix as well so

107
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,490
again legitimate companies rely on
strong unbreakable encryption

108
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,310
technologies not just the terrorists so
any talk about back to encryption is

109
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:20,520
just plain wrong so I'm gonna go through
these next three sides on how to do full

110
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,540
disk encryption and then kind of move
down to where you can do a removable

111
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,710
media encryption if you allow it in your
environment again like I said enterprise

112
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,760
data protection will be an additional
module that's not that locker

113
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,090
but if you want to do basic DLP whenever
people are attaching stuff too like

114
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:48,960
emails and so far so this slide deck
again I apologize even in the product

115
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,960
pricing out trouble seeing this this was
this was taken from the National

116
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:01,900
Security Agency's website ensuite be
encryption they recently updated 824 I

117
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,770
guess what I want safe they they've done
today yes 256 they no longer consider

118
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:13,590
shot 256 hashing algorithms viable for
post quantum encryption so my slide

119
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:23,790
excerpt gonna use shot 3 t-4 has seen an
AES 256 our psyches so one of the first

120
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,310
things that you're going to need to do
is you're gonna need a publisher root CA

121
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,370
if you want to do PKI really on the
cheap

122
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:37,640
there's free tools out there like xEA
that's based upon OpenSSL you can do it

123
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,660
that way if you want a quick and dirty
way of getting routier's published in

124
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,840
your organizations and the reason why
the reason why they were really kind of

125
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,690
doing is really for some rule media
policies and I'm gonna get into data

126
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,810
recovery agents here in a bit on my need
that sort of thing so again a very said

127
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,790
this full disk encryption with Windows
10 is no difference who made you need to

128
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,780
be careful because the default
encryption algorithm for bill walkers a

129
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:19,490
yes to 128 you're gonna need to bump
that to 256 also you don't want your

130
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:25,220
users really kind of dictating whether
they wanted to use spaced only or full

131
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:33,580
so internally if you have any type of
internal disk wiping processes and

132
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,690
you're unsure about those

133
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,520
you never wanted you never wanted to
encrypt you space selling just too full

134
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,800
and I will do the best for end-to-end
this just an example policy that allows

135
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,340
full encryption

136
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,510
this is an example policy that you space
only encryption

137
00:12:52,510 --> 00:13:00,170
you don't want to do those so what I'm
gonna get into here in the next upcoming

138
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,870
slides is like how to prevent direct
memory access attacks as you roll out

139
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:12,220
but lockheed organizations this also
supports smart cards AES 256 supported

140
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,860
40 s fixed s removable media into
previewed at the indication again this

141
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,860
is not a sales pitch this is just some
of the things that I've done with

142
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,530
BitLocker in a lock it down and secure
it

143
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:32,840
based really kind of upon these
different items which is kids be kids

144
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:39,060
and rootkits brute force sign NDMA
attacks Amare tax all that kind of stuff

145
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:45,570
so one of the first things that you're
going to prevent doing is you're going

146
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,290
to prevent the installation of firewire
devices and you can do this and this is

147
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:57,050
available in the Security Compliance
Manager tool kit so whenever you export

148
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,480
and import it into your Group Policy
Objects this is going to go along with

149
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,840
it by the fall so this is good to
prevent DMA attacks so if firewire exist

150
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:14,740
on a laptop a nobody scab access to
install devices using using that port

151
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:22,460
same here with interactive machine log
onto mushy account lockout threshold set

152
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,210
to like 10 invalid attempts you can move
it down to something smaller group

153
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:33,140
policy but what that's really going to
do is if a laptop is stolen and somebody

154
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:40,350
is trying to brute force a reboot
authentication screen after that tenth

155
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,300
attempt or whatever it's just gonna shut
down on yet it's gonna say hey to many

156
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:51,740
penitent pinon tree attempts so you know
your laptop you're gonna get owned owned

157
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,450
if you fell at DMA mitigation enable
secure boot your laptop surprise gonna

158
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,640
be higher value

159
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,380
targets and desktop so choose wisely
whatever you do it previewed at that

160
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:12,600
location so down this is world 736
encryption algorithm this is where I

161
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,350
preventing firewire for being used

162
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,340
also turning off standby states for
sleep settings I don't want somebody to

163
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:31,710
shut down the laptop and it going to
sleep so more stuff so I'm not going to

164
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:38,910
allow BitLocker without compatible TPM
chips that's gonna be disabled so this

165
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,800
is really good for laptops where I'm
going to require startup in with the TPM

166
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,120
that's gonna be required right out of
the gate as machines get provision with

167
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
BitLocker

168
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,990
some get into next on how we can come to
prevent USB data data copy n dont

169
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:07,520
superglue USB ports that's not a good
idea so one of the things I'm doing here

170
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:14,150
with this policy is on preventing
installation of removable devices that's

171
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:19,930
gonna be enabled and then I'm gonna go
on down we're saying my removable

172
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,910
storage access and you can do this by
User machine depending on how you move

173
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:32,200
stuff around in Active Directory so I'm
basically going to say hey I don't want

174
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,670
people direct access with remote session
such as RTP and that kind of stuff and

175
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:45,190
then I'm gonna tell everything hate when
I read right next to access for CDs DVDs

176
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:51,690
removable desk W PD's devices such as if
somebody is this a cell phone and they

177
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,770
attach it then I'm also going to prevent
the usage of one drive for storage don't

178
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,270
want people getting out there so one of
the things that I don't do on here is i

179
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,550
i don't set it up to do

180
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:11,810
readout I do setup where people can read
CDs stuff like that so moving on down

181
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:19,870
saying up my removal data policies so
I'm gonna allow BitLocker data recovery

182
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,910
agents and there's gonna be a reason for
that and I'm just gonna go ahead and put

183
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:29,530
through some gonna be running out of
time here forty law there's a reason for

184
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:37,740
that I wore the plugin if they do have
access to do so if they plug in USB

185
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,970
sticks I wanted to have two options
either if they don't want to encrypt to

186
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:49,630
drive its gonna be read only other
option is to encrypt it it's gonna do

187
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,060
full end-to-end encryption those should
be the only two options that users

188
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,460
should even have they shouldn't have
anything else so we make a real simple

189
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,250
because we're using data recovery agent
all the end user has to do is a password

190
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,880
is applicable to your environment so you
can you can set what you wanted to be 68

191
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,020
characters letters number spaces symbols
all that good stuff

192
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:25,480
the last thing you want to do is you
won't allow users to apply BitLocker

193
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,000
protection but you don't want to allow
users to suspend or decrypt BitLocker

194
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,920
connections usual rule media so this GPO
right here is going to help with someone

195
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:45,330
so next time I'm gonna get into is just
some PowerShell into a managed SPD dash

196
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:52,710
status and get a full outlook of like
how my USB is encrypted it's a hundred

197
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:58,490
percent encrypted its encrypted with AES
256 prior notice here I've been

198
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,320
identification filled culture because
that's really important to

199
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,900
used with data recovery agents because
data recovery agents hurling at work if

200
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:17,610
you have identification set set up with
your group policies so how do I know

201
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,440
that well if you dig down further and
get into protectors

202
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,210
one thing's gonna see here as I'm gonna
see a certificate thumbprint and normal

203
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,410
user that's really not going to mean
anything for an admin that has the

204
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:40,670
private key to the thumbprint you're
gonna be able to actually unlock the

205
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,430
data without knowing their password
because it's gonna be inevitable where

206
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,070
somebody's gonna come in and they're
gonna tell you hey I forgot my password

207
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:57,650
but I really need to date off this so
that's that's really the reason why data

208
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:02,320
recovery agency should pry do them on a
removable media again I don't use

209
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,950
anything less than a shot 384 Hao Xin
and and and and our say 4096 big key

210
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:14,100
don't make that private key export on
any admin system you want to lock down

211
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:21,550
to just prove specific devices and
that's it so moving on down that's just

212
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:28,810
the identification fields it's very
important for Dr agents if you need to

213
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,980
set one up yet to set your key usage up
with key insight from it and then your

214
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:40,120
application for your extended I guess
key policies with as a key recovery

215
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,450
agent bill archer drive encryption and
BitLocker data recovery agent this is

216
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:54,190
Group Policy amor you guys are gonna be
able see a 2004 ok this is where I i

217
00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:00,600
setup my Dr age and this is more stuff
on how to unlock using those

218
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,490
certificates so I'm gonna do a managed
bTW dash unlock on the drive and then

219
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,190
I'm going to specify certificate
thumbprint and then that thumbprint that

220
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,360
I hadn't previous side

221
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,860
I'm going to execute that PowerShell and
that's gonna automatically unlock my

222
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:27,330
drive so few other things I'm not going
into a real death but you know Microsoft

223
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,280
edge is available

224
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,710
lot of high security organizations are
going to have a tough time migrating to

225
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,900
that edge doesn't support to begin
romance at all it doesn't know what the

226
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,990
hell it is so if you have a PKI set up
or even something as simple as if you're

227
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:53,450
trying to enroll certificate for for SME
encryption it's it's gonna fail

228
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,750
unfortunately I'm still suggesting org
stuck with a weapon with emmitt or set

229
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,500
up Google Chrome for work

230
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,520
one of the two we're still havin I'm
still seeing remote code execution with

231
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:13,790
Microsoft adds we've had two between
August and September here we gotta see

232
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:19,960
this is promoting website we see right
here that it's not allowing us to drop

233
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,640
private keys at all so that's that's why
edges just gonna be an issue

234
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,440
these are all just group policies that
you can set up with that they're very

235
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:37,310
small I think there's maybe a handful of
like 10 so this is probably one of the

236
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,520
more important lands because a lot of
people been complaining about what does

237
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,940
10 privacy on disabling telemetry well
you can disable telemetry just fine with

238
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:53,070
understand enterprise but the problem is
if you disable any running Windows 10

239
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,730
Pro dormitories not disabled there's
actually a registry key that's gonna

240
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:04,720
processed under hkey local machine under
policies Microsoft Windows data

241
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,450
collection you can ride out policy that
just set to zero and that'll go ahead

242
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:16,880
and kill telemetry on what does temporal
machines

243
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,460
so finally just want to talk real quick
about threat recessed incentive I

244
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,760
security this is around what does tend
to buy scarred now device card is really

245
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:33,890
kind of more holistic solution because
you're basically doing virtualized based

246
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,170
security and unfortunately again locked
into hyper-v whenever you do that sort

247
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:44,340
of thing along with that when we
actually start setting up policies for

248
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:52,360
device card you have the option to add
the following components such as

249
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,150
isolated user mode credential card
inside Group Policy those are easy wins

250
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:07,550
but they they really kind of they really
walks in the hyper-v which I hate that I

251
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:12,550
credential guard is great for mitigating
passed the house and also in a couple

252
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:17,750
slides here on how that mitigates once
once you have a hypervisor really kind

253
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,640
of set up for it

254
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,920
ium really kind of protection against
admin and kernel level malware and of

255
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,960
course you need to configure code based
integrity with all that so you're gonna

256
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,870
need a physical machine obviously for
all this you can't do it in a

257
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,180
virtualized environment already so it's
going to have a TPM its gonna need to

258
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:47,420
have you at unified 2.3 or 2.4 device
carte pricing at work for older machines

259
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:53,990
and you're gonna be locked in hyper-v so
that could be an issue for some if you

260
00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:00,020
actually wanna get down and you want to
unlock hyper the hypervisor and isolated

261
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,230
user mode you can go into Windows
features turning both on and and let it

262
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:13,800
run so here I am doing here is I'm
setting up the fertilization base

263
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:21,250
security telling it how secure boot and
DMA protection I want to enable

264
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,760
virtualize based protection of code
integrity that's where you're signing

265
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,260
your see eyes so

266
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,970
and then I'm gonna enable credential
guard their policy is short with this

267
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:39,270
really kind of the bigger issue with
Prudential guard and I'll get into that

268
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:50,760
here in my last section this is until
I'm with regard this is so this is this

269
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,980
is a pass the house fell whenever
whenever that's not been able so

270
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,280
critical guards pride easiest thing to
like implement just to kind of cut this

271
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:09,140
will be shorter here because I like two
minutes left I rode out like a lot of

272
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,850
pseudo code on what it takes to
implement by scarred man that is really

273
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:25,410
shady I mean I apologize for the mir
display yeah I can't my resolution any

274
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:35,050
lower so very well you get the point to
it I have roughly a hundred and

275
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:42,110
forty-one lines where the pseudocode to
implement device card so there's a lot

276
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:50,480
of there's a lot of abstracts that I
have out of my slide decks so all but

277
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,900
the beginning of the slide deck back out
here but anyway in my abstracts I do

278
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:04,870
have implementing Microsoft passport in
