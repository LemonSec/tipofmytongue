1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,950
I guess he probably go and get started I
think thirty seconds earlier is ok maybe

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,670
there are you planning on seeing me I
don't feel comfortable standing on a

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,129
chair but maybe if I do this you can see
my hands feel up here so they start

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,109
sticking around my talk packing web apps
this is mostly suck out of an

5
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:26,240
introduction so if you haven't started
hacking web apps or something you want

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,570
to get into this talk is designed to
sort of point you in the right path and

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,630
kind of show you what what I do as a pen
tester client kickoff call the way to

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:46,030
record delivery so quick disclaimer
composite video and kick off so kick off

9
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,010
call there's a few things that happen
initially when the project starts so

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,879
once all the legal stuff has happened
with the client you know they've signed

11
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,160
the paperwork and everything what we do
is we go to our rules of engagement or

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,129
that basically clarifies what the scope
is pages that they might not want us to

13
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,500
touch that are sensitive testing window
is a 24 by seven or is it only business

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,560
hours Monday through Friday information
like that

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,570
also the point of contacts do you have a
question or if you happened to set the

16
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,799
building on fire by some magical mystery
than you know who to call something to

17
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,860
remember at the end of every assessment
a report is expected just keep this in

18
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,400
mind as you go through you and I want to
make sure to document as much as

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,409
possible

20
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,030
distrust me this does make your life
much easier at the end instead of

21
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,790
thinking shoot I didn't save a
screenshot for that cross site scripting

22
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,040
or whatever it is keep that in mind

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,270
ok so how do I keep notes well keep know
it's convenient name for the application

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,539
it's built into Cali Linux that's also
available for Windows and Mac OS and

25
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:09,019
it's pretty cool way to store
screenshots or code or anything else you

26
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:12,580
can make different pages and a cool
thing about it is that when you're done

27
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,319
with it you can actually exported always
HTML and get right to the client if they

28
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,660
want your on its so they don't have to
install any sort of special software for

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,090
themselves

30
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,989
couple of ways that I keep things
organized so after you have several

31
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:36,579
items if you have several websites or
IDs and scope you can grab it by IP or

32
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:42,000
if you're working on just a couple is
all grouped by vulnerability as you can

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,470
see the darker red or maroon colored
that would be my chronicles the red

34
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:55,879
would be a serious and then the orange
or yellow is low and blue informational

35
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,440
that's just a personal preference
however you wanna do it but for me

36
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:07,910
that's just a quick visual way as I'm
keeping track of what I found evidence

37
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,620
gathering citizens you as a few
prototypes of what to document as you're

38
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,829
going through and doing these these
assessments any HTTP request and

39
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:23,150
response that you get make sure document
those so for example I have found a

40
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,040
cross-site scripting vulnerability not
only going to document that the GET

41
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,000
request that shows what I said I'm also
going to document the response code and

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,329
I also do a screenshot to show where the
code executed so make sure to document

43
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:46,030
those things anyone scheduled downtime
or issues so if for whatever reason they

44
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,359
didn't properly whitelist you on their
firewall their IDs IPs and those were

45
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,079
times that you couldn't access the
website this make a quick note on that

46
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,360
that way if they have any issues going
over there

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,860
you can say hey I can access your site
during this time any money to monetary

48
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,200
transactions listed bank website or
e-commerce or something

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,440
log that information that way if you do
happen use personal car company card you

50
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,900
can get your money back again don't
share any screenshots of any cool hacks

51
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,190
if you happen to get rude on a box or
something don't share that online

52
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:31,120
disclosure agreement so you know don't
you it's not a good thing to do

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,010
make sure you get relevant legible
screenshots for example I know that's

54
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:43,900
kind of hard to say back there but if
you if you find a really good you get

55
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,000
like sequel injection or something

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,530
make sure to take screenshots of legible
parts of the uprights 04

57
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,120
map for example sometimes it can be a
whole lot of output depending on the

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,160
tables and things like that if you need
to copy and paste something that's more

59
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,220
legible who dis your terminal do that
but just make sure that it's something

60
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,760
the client can read so they can actually
understand what it is they're looking

61
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:14,640
for a way that I like to call out my
HTTP requests and responses as I like to

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,979
highlight it you can't put it as a code
snippet and for example you can see

63
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,900
where it says username equals and then
just a basic check for seeking injection

64
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,660
you can see I have that if you wanna
call the payload is highlighted that way

65
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,350
as the client is looking at the report
they can see exactly what caused the

66
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,919
issue

67
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
guys sorry having to go through this
really really quick so you have any

68
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,460
questions or anything after talk please
come see you if you do find a single

69
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,690
injection for example make sure you
check every parameter that's in the

70
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,249
application for all the same things
peres

71
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:55,939
if you find one parameter thats
vulnerable to seek an injection there

72
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,209
could be seven or eight more that are
vulnerable as well she want to make sure

73
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:07,199
to check those and document all those
parameters under that finding something

74
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,869
that I go by because there's so many
things to look at and do so many of

75
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:16,239
these assessments as a methodology our
checklist you don't want to be

76
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:20,899
necessarily confined to these this check
list because they can change so much but

77
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:24,669
basically just something to kind of help
keep you in order to make sure you're

78
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:33,159
not forgetting to look at some big
obvious glaring thing discovery open

79
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,179
source intelligence these are things
that we include in our methodology and

80
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:42,219
so basically we were doing this is my
client gives us a website would go look

81
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:48,389
at not only the IP to see what other IP
is that they have or we also want to

82
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,699
check and see if there's any domain
squatting or someone thats copying their

83
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:58,629
site for phishing site and so learning
to use tools like Facebook and Google

84
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:02,459
and all these things for open source
intelligence is a great way to check to

85
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,989
see not only if someone is trying to
copy the site or do something malicious

86
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:13,929
but it's also a good way to see if this
company has been compromised before so

87
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:15,149
you might be able to find

88
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:19,649
credentials or information that's that's
already exposed to the internet from a

89
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:24,699
previous half so that that's that's a
good thing that you want to make sure to

90
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:32,519
do for every assessment through this I
found data base types without having to

91
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:38,159
do any enumeration I found entire
database schemas or credentials

92
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:43,579
current credentials and several things
through developer forums through

93
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:49,229
archived emails several things so it's
it's very time consuming but it's

94
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:50,849
definitely worth it and you

95
00:07:50,849 --> 00:08:00,319
payoff for sure so discovery a tad more
to discover eosin discover is a great

96
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,080
tool that like to use their squad at
their several out there but one of the

97
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,639
ones I go to first was discovered by Lee
Baird because it covers so many things

98
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,309
so quick so make sure you check that out

99
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:19,020
automated scanning yes we automated
scanning well you're supposed to be a

100
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,550
real hacker way to use on its can tell
you I again we do so many of these

101
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,559
assessments so quick that they cover a
lot of ground and look for a lot of

102
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:34,669
low-hanging fruits we don't ever just
give them in their results

103
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,069
straight from the automated scanner
because an automated scanner is not a

104
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:45,769
pen test a boner ability scan is not a
pen test so we just kind of use that to

105
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:46,660
see ok

106
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,209
are there any big glaring holes or we
could look at and of course we go

107
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,399
through and we do false-positive
analysis and sit there something we need

108
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,670
to dig deeper so it's just kind of a
little added to help us cover a lot of

109
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,959
ground really quick

110
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:10,930
the big time saver and again a bone scan
is not meant to those who say that it is

111
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:18,880
I would beg to differ so even those
scanners help again we have to validate

112
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,130
their findings see you know is that
there was just a scanner that totally

113
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,610
misread something don't rely on those
make sure you test it

114
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:37,250
you automated scanners that we use our
analysis and IBM apps can skate pro at

115
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,670
the highest grade automated scanning and
add-ons that you can put in there with

116
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,820
it to help make it even more valuable
and then you have

117
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,500
things like Nick too and then if it's a
framework like WordPress or Joomla

118
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,260
Drupal or something like that there are
also tools UWP scan that's for WordPress

119
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,360
sites are things that go through and
look for just some major glaring holes

120
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,950
things that help you save time and no
Oscar buster some people argue that this

121
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,800
is a huge waste of time sometimes it is
sometimes have actually gotten some

122
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,910
really valuable results for running this
basically if you're not familiar with it

123
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,420
when it does it will actually you can be
a huge directory names of directories

124
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,740
things that were doing search for or it
will do it at rude reports or start from

125
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,070
901 and always liked all the Alpha bad
and it will try all these different

126
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,130
combinations it can take a long time but
it's a good way to find some hidden

127
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:45,990
directories as more options and Kali
that you can check your not familiar to

128
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,940
check this actually tells you exactly
where to go in the menu

129
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,760
a few pro chips for automated scanning
verify the settings don't just put in

130
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,190
the URL and click Go

131
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,470
you want to check how many threads are
you going to flood their system do you

132
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,230
have safe checks on you know you have
certain denial of service things turned

133
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,450
off just go through and look and make
sure that you understand the tour before

134
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:18,280
you go otherwise you could potentially
cause a lot of problems it do they have

135
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,780
any certain pages like a contact page or
sign-up page or something that they

136
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,680
wanted to avoid otherwise this can
really just their data base with a lot

137
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,360
of junk which could potentially cause
analysis or actual or chrome dads get

138
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,850
sometimes you do test and production
environment and not a development

139
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,690
environment so those are all things that
you want to check in when you're ready

140
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,660
got everything set up you know then
click Go

141
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,279
now the good stuff

142
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:56,050
manual testing hasn't talked about you
wanna take some of that you want to go

143
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,319
through and look at what the automated
scanners have found that they fine

144
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:05,769
sequel injection for example if they did
take that throw it in something like

145
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:09,449
burp suite pro or something where you
can replay that attack and you really

146
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:12,540
dig into it to see if it's a false
positive or not

147
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,610
manual or automated scanners can only go
so far they they can only do so much

148
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,589
there's a human element the interaction
just isn't there so that's why you have

149
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:29,889
to do manual testing to make it with
gentleman again like we proceeded and he

150
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,449
talked about that a lot because it's
it's kind of a regular go to tools for

151
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:41,550
many things there are also other tools
out there for manual testing as far as

152
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,610
proxy tools like zap

153
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,720
familiar with bad and several other
tools that you can do some research on

154
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,360
talk about some of the stuff I'm trying
to get a train to go through it as quick

155
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,829
as I can hear parameters are not
familiar with program is being if you're

156
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:07,029
not familiar with what parameters are an
application there are several resources

157
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,709
on the internet for free that will help
you explain and understand that once you

158
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,329
get a better understanding of what that
is

159
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:21,309
start diving into the application more

160
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:28,389
see sometimes the parameters will be in
the URL or sometimes they're only

161
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:32,189
imposed requests so just make sure to
sort of looking at the coding and

162
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:36,569
digging in and really trying to break
the application in as many ways as

163
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:43,649
possible I'm just going to click through
to view the slides because there's so

164
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,329
much information

165
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:50,589
basic things you want to look or again
cross-site scripting

166
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:56,710
cross-site request forgery sequel on
LDAP injections

167
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:03,320
local and remote file inclusions so
again use Google or become familiar with

168
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,620
those terms and exactly what they are
you can you can really leverage some

169
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,750
Italian really leverage those
vulnerabilities for some really good

170
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:17,760
attacks several times we've been able to
completely compromised and even further

171
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,770
into networks Thurs something simple
like sequel injection so just make sure

172
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:28,380
you just become as familiar with that
can there are also several diem diem

173
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:36,220
that you can download practice I'm
trying to think of the name a few

174
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,810
yeah yeah damn horrible there there are
so many out there right now they have

175
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:47,910
some have specific scenarios for you to
follow almost like capture the flag type

176
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,750
so just really practice those in your
home lab to become familiar with the

177
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:58,600
towards other things you want to look
for as their sensitive information being

178
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,680
passed through a get requests just
remember that those get requests can be

179
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,620
cash on the local user browser so if
something happens and I machines

180
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,500
compromise and there's credentials are
something that are stored in the history

181
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,160
from the gate request the attacker could
potentially get those and then leverage

182
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,650
with that information so that's the
stuff that you want to check now to

183
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:26,520
prevent death by PowerPoint happy dog
hot dog for a second

184
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,650
other things you want to check this
makes them more notes

185
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:39,850
authentication how are you up indicating
to the application is using SSL TLS can

186
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,640
you access certain pages as an
unauthenticated user or maybe if you're

187
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,190
just a regular level use her and you see
URLs in the code admin

188
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:56,400
can you access the admin pages as a non
admin user so

189
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,310
privilege escalation things like that
those are all things that you want to

190
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:10,050
check for authentication for sure don't
just look at the web app also want to

191
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,360
look at the host of the rapids on or do
they have certain services open that

192
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,150
they that shouldn't be there sometimes
even externally we've seen a remote

193
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,830
desktop and desktop unable to the
Internet

194
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,500
don't ask him as a silly thing but check
those things because you know there

195
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,650
could be other ways to compromise to
host of other than through the web app

196
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:38,790
so make sure what the host is a running
an outdated install sir yes something

197
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:51,390
like that can you that you could see you
know a good photo HTTP methods do they

198
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:57,330
have good copy delete trace or other
methods enabled sometimes we found that

199
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,950
is enabled so what do we do we put a
shell script up there and we have

200
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,250
automatically compromise that hosts just
because we could put information up

201
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:13,880
their name overdone delete was enabled
so deleted it so sounds really simple

202
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,420
one kind of stupid but those things are
in there so we always want to make sure

203
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:23,459
to check there is to see if that's
something you can leverage again

204
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,949
director commercial shell-shocked heart
bleed so these are all things you want

205
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:38,530
to look at for the hosts as well so
there are several things that you can

206
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:44,140
again as I mentioned using several
things you can find out about all the

207
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,640
things we've talked about so far
different methodologies I highly

208
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,380
recommend

209
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,170
the methodology from a loss and
basically what that's going to do is

210
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,720
give you an outline of things to look at

211
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,790
help keep you on track during your
assessment to make sure you're trying to

212
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:05,760
cover all the grounds of the application
sure you set up a practice lap don't

213
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,310
ever try a new tour something you're not
familiar with on a client site for the

214
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:16,060
first time cuz be disastrous and then
when they say well what did you do and

215
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,610
you say I don't know that's never a
never a good day so always make sure you

216
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,690
know what you're told you're doing and
practice them before you do it and wants

217
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,730
you get everything set up and you've
practiced go ahead some websites

218
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,950
actually got through this fast enough
like I was hoping to to leave time for

219
00:18:38,950 --> 00:19:04,000
Q&A if anyone has any questions for me
please on you know you have any

220
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:22,750
questions about time we tell the client
say like Monday and Tuesday will be the

221
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:28,270
heaviest day for traffic ok so Monday
and Tuesday will run IBM abscam will do

222
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,670
it unauthenticated and then we'll use
credentials for authenticated scan to

223
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:37,270
see what it gets and then later in the
week what we do is we will look at the

224
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,420
output and see if there's something
worth going

225
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:47,020
after and we'll start validating that
through burps we are on our own I know I

226
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,860
would I wouldn't proxy that will be a
lot of garbage

227
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:58,740
yeah yeah and that would be a gigantic
file too because of how much stuff yeah

228
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,620
yeah so whenever we do an automated
scanning like Nexus or IBM abscam

229
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,250
something that's off by its side

230
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,230
course it logs self so we'll do that and
then what we do is look at those results

231
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,380
and replay the things that look
interesting

232
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:27,550
manually through birds we grow so that
the answer question for ya for web

233
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:34,080
applications not so much mostly just to
look at the host just to see what the

234
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,190
host is running and it does a quick scan
of you know SSL TLS ciphers they have

235
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:46,460
enabled at their certificates ballot is
it out today in all the basic checks

236
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:53,660
yeah but as far as the actual web web
app itself now that I know you can throw

237
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,060
and potentials and things like that but
i just i don't know that I would

238
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,670
necessarily trust and as much not saying
anything bad about this because it's

239
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:10,150
great tool but I don't think as far as
like specifically for a web out so it's

240
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:29,049
a good question by else

241
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:43,509
yeah it since Tennessee like it looks
super serious when you see it but you

242
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:50,720
know as well as a pen tester all the
applications I looked at think maybe two

243
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,629
or three that I actually classified that
as a serious or critical and it's kind

244
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:03,690
of a kind of depends on the application
what's going on now they're there are

245
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,999
ways to leverage that but then you have
to look at you know what's the

246
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:13,419
likelihood versus the risk as well so
really it's one of those things where

247
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:17,489
you have to look at it you know is that
possible what can you do with it and

248
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:22,450
then the likelihood person's risk so it
kinda just depends on the application

249
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,730
and and what the applications so
unfortunately like a lot of these things

250
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:41,879
is not absolutely 100% answer yes that's
critical show if you have suspicions

251
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:48,019
that ability is there just keep doing
research keep beating away that because

252
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:52,820
they like the most common way to do it
or like the proof of concept that works

253
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,970
we probe might give you it's like well
what does that matter but say you really

254
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,149
really dig in and start looking
obfuscation techniques encoding thing

255
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:05,590
certain ways that by Pastor Web
Application Firewall are certain things

256
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,629
that you could you maybe get something
in there that you couldn't just by a

257
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:15,169
high-level example so I encourage you to
really dig into that and just just beat

258
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:20,480
it up as much as you can

259
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:30,140
that's that's a great point and some
will say well why do we need to turn

260
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,940
that off you know your hackers around
that there are ways that we can but when

261
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,510
you look at the contract we usually only
have one or two weeks to do this and it

262
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:46,330
takes quite a while to fill that out and
see like how you need to get things in

263
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,840
and out of application for awhile before
you're being blocked it so we say look

264
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:57,260
just whitelist us let us go through
there let's get past that as if we're an

265
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,150
attacker that's already figured out that
way we know what's behind it so you

266
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,850
always want to have them whitelist you
on application firewall and any ideas

267
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,980
IPS that they might have as well so you
want to make sure that you're properly

268
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,350
whitelisted so you get accurate results
so

269
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:20,780
alright anymore questions thank you guys
SO SO much are ready for the question

270
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,700
you've asked well thank you guys so much

271
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,990
if you have any more questions come see
me I'll be happy to answer
