1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,619
other closing the doors to locking the
door striker well welcome and good

2
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:28,740
morning in a very heavy ok alright well
originally the the title is it is beyond

3
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,280
bad IP addresses hashes and domain names
but I'm gonna call the I was awake from

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,020
the crystal meth party so I'm just gonna
show up someplace so for those of you

5
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,239
came and I do appreciate coming in on a
Sunday morning after the party

6
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,989
especially after I can have my mind I
love so it's just my name which makes me

7
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,449
sound like a narcissistic what we gonna
talk about we're gonna talk about it

8
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:02,030
became why no so good morning where
we're going to talk about today is sexy

9
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,170
and infrared intelligence to do analysis
so getting beyond bad IP addresses that

10
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:15,170
hashes and fat names so low about myself
and I will employ I grew up I had a

11
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:25,520
funny I wish so I was homeschooled still
going in high school and these were

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,920
mostly things that I dealt with it if
you can recognize some of them yes that

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,720
is natural acoustic coupler remote up
for those of you don't know where that

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,430
is we actually had to dial into the
internet before we actually had our own

15
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:45,640
as you can possibly imagine this made me
very popular with the wind so when I

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,840
finally ended up going to high school

17
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:59,569
I might have been a key which by the way
you know being the having the Chess Club

18
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:07,110
as your posse is not going to help you
with your being put into a dumpster I am

19
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:18,930
a veteran of the United States Navy
veteran diver very much appreciated and

20
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:26,970
yes I actually thought I could pull off
this mustache and I became an

21
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,060
information security professional
actually you know him into it as a

22
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,760
career and felt that way I can take my
knowledge of what I learn and help

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,019
organizations to be able to do this that
started about twenty years ago

24
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:49,930
are actually no point five years ago now
my wife says that I talk too much about

25
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:59,700
it by the fact that just like you will
find and I wasn't always jaded somebody

26
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,769
actually asked me to like how do we know
that you come on now look at the ears

27
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:11,280
shares have not changed but yes it is
true I am jaded I've been doing this for

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,599
25 years now that information scurry
scurry operations management for 25

29
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,849
years and yes I am now to the point in
my career where when something bad

30
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:27,230
happens I just sit back and are growing
like the Cheshire Cat so now how many of

31
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:34,400
us have seen this yeah this looks pretty
damn sexy right and we put this on our

32
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,639
displays when our executives and
leadership walk into the office and

33
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,269
they're like you guys are really doing
something you know it looks looks pretty

34
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:47,970
amazing

35
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,340
but ultimately we talk about threat
intelligence were also talking about how

36
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,290
to get in front of these types of
attacks how do we get in for malware

37
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:02,210
distribution block spammers anybody ever
have to deal with Hamming not a fun

38
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,670
thing to have to deal with a clean up
right

39
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:11,350
phishing campaigns against organizations
dealing with known botnets you get that

40
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,760
call at two o'clock in the morning hey
we're seeing a lot of activity peeking

41
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,670
out to some place for those of you Fri
getting those alerts and say hey we have

42
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,980
identified that you're communicating
your organization's communicating with

43
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:29,080
the known product we did a certain
elements in order to ensure that we can

44
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,550
defend her businesses make better
decisions and reduce the impact of

45
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,960
business because ultimately how many of
you have the actual resources and and

46
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,890
you know the unlimited budget that you
actually need to protect organizations

47
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:55,910
and so you're with the NSA right ok well
today as we talked about today is the

48
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,190
general little bit about how I got
involved in threat intelligence in the

49
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,570
commercial sector talk about what a
threat intelligence program is the

50
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,220
importance of analysis and then we're
going to take a look at a case study for

51
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,580
actually watching and analyzing data
that came through and being able to

52
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,040
attract about contributed to a central
park organization and we'll talk about

53
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:32,110
the business value ultimately I am
appalled by how I got started in this

54
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,030
we establish security through obscurity
and there were a lot of our businesses

55
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:43,830
are working on no hope faith and denial
starting to happen to us we're hoping

56
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:50,540
that you know we're not big enough to be
on anybody's radar this is my favorite

57
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,130
one that I her I actually had somebody
tell us we don't have anything anybody

58
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,000
would want which sort of things the next
question of how are you and business

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,330
alive lots of the things that you are
here as a as a consultant that come out

60
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,230
it's like you know what we have nothing
that anybody would want nothing like

61
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:16,730
you're a multi-billion dollar
organization I'm going to disagree so a

62
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,120
lot of us ended up making the basic
questions

63
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:28,130
Tango Foxtrot now as you can see how
much of a little white guy I can't

64
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,260
really dance but I can drink whiskey
that I got accused of being a fun

65
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,630
peddler at a conference when we were
talking about how bad things are

66
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:42,260
actually on the internet somebody had
made mention of the fact that we've got

67
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,740
this come online and it's no problem I'm
like no you're getting attacked

68
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,360
constantly just don't realize it and a
sales engineer any sales engineers in

69
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,870
the room ok good don't raise your hand
if you just get that was me being a butt

70
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:06,890
paddler that made me upset now you take
somebody that's got over twenty years in

71
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,920
the industry is one of two things that's
going to happen one of them is a good

72
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,780
include a very sharp pointy stick or
they're just gonna tell between my legs

73
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,200
and walk off

74
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:29,260
I go for the pointy stick so based on
the information that I had available I

75
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,740
have gone back to her questions that
company rather read statements

76
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:42,260
accompanied you were making and they
made me really thing you know is this

77
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:49,830
something we need to address here's a
area businesses actually believe this

78
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,730
are they rolling the dice trying to
protect themselves so we talk about

79
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:02,190
threat intelligence and we talked about
adversaries in specific amusing at the

80
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,100
series in a very high level two things I
want to share with you that to my

81
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:14,060
closest peers and colleagues have told
me so anybody know Robert namely ok so

82
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,650
Rob loves to be able to tell the
following that you have zero influence

83
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:27,610
of zero influence on an adversary
choosing to target an attack you how

84
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,790
many of you believe that you can go back
and you know negotiate with like

85
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:37,910
anonymous the say hey take off your
radar or tell the criminal syndicates at

86
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:43,370
hey please dont vicious the weekend
coming up and I don't wanna work my

87
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:51,660
partner rendition is very fond of saying
that unlike the attacker the target gets

88
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,560
to choose the field of battle you know
all the systems that have been patched

89
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,840
in the last three years for the Windows
XP systems that are still in our

90
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,100
environment that are exploitable that's
what we're that is our field of battle

91
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,930
the importance of understanding this
just put yourself in the mindset of the

92
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,320
absurd because ultimately

93
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:23,120
nation states prevails in the kids
activists terrorist insiders they don't

94
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,420
care about maintenance windows they
don't care about contracts that protect

95
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,530
you how many of you have the you know
the contract or the lawyer that's like

96
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,360
to know what we meet all the
requirements of the contract to work

97
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,920
good that doesn't work with you know I
don't see i don't see the criminal

98
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,170
syndicates women open the thinking going
all their cover by contract we can't do

99
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:53,160
this so going back to earlier being
accused of being a fun color and

100
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,020
demonstrate the fact that attacks are
actually happening i dont want two days

101
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:06,080
I love honey pots the information in
value that you can get beyond just the

102
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,360
sheer academic perspective is is great

103
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,410
later on this morning there's gonna be a
talk by gentleman we know who's going to

104
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,390
be doing long tail thank you we're going
to be doing long tail on the ground SSH

105
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:28,690
attacks highly recommended specially
since you're already up and moving so I

106
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,790
built my initial honey pot and then I
got a little out of hand and i ended up

107
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:40,180
calling in favors and markers with
friends family which by the way after

108
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,490
years of telling my grandmother not to
click a link to download something when

109
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,460
I told her no download this from from
this email and she's like well you told

110
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:54,440
me never to click the link and like I'm
your grandson you can trust means you

111
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,350
like but it came in through email job
was done I did well let's talk about

112
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,670
intelligence programs and for most of us
we talk when we hear threat intelligence

113
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,790
nowadays you know what is it that that
normally happens when it comes on site

114
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,540
they talk about talk about through their
data that they have and you don't fire

115
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,870
list of fat

116
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:27,960
you can buy it so well spoiler
indicators are compromised websites

117
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:37,460
domain names not threat intelligence
vendors will try to get you to believe

118
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,790
that this is my intelligence look at the
vendors in in a minute this is also not

119
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,520
attend college actually have somebody
who said Google let out at RTI method

120
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:59,660
know at all the value that threat
intelligence can bring to an

121
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:07,390
organization when properly utilize is is
great however you have to realize that

122
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,950
is just another tool I had an actual
crime that said hey if we buy threat

123
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:18,230
intelligence we don't have to monitor
network and I was like no way do you

124
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:25,010
smoke can I have some it's not a
replacement for your actual people on

125
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,770
the ground it's meant to be a force
multiplier in augmenter it's not meant

126
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:37,130
to be a replacement for some common
misconceptions when it comes to telling

127
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,690
him that you know we've made some sprite
off the shelf right he does not want to

128
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,140
celebrate with vulnerability scanning
engines right now we can buy those and

129
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,970
they come in and run against our
networks and then they provide all these

130
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,279
high alerts we take those high alert
when taken to the business and they look

131
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,420
at us and no no that's not a high impact
organization same thing is starting to

132
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,910
happen when it comes to threat
intelligence is there an ending up with

133
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:09,029
a lot of information and it doesn't have
the impact and then value that they can

134
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:15,589
have second option is that it requires
you know his budget that requires a

135
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,270
large amount of

136
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,260
capital to be able to do this it does
require investments however if you

137
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,560
invest wisely in your people and
processes the technology can be

138
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,740
predominantly executed the open source
systems one size fits all again going

139
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,430
back to the area vulnerability
assessments one tool will rule the

140
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,830
entire network doesn't work as well when
you're talking in threat intelligence I

141
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:50,090
had also that the only party formation
technology and IT security practitioners

142
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:57,780
now we start talking about threat
intelligence what we're talking about is

143
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:08,080
being able to provide information around
making decisions for college look at it

144
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:14,030
as an actual manage business management
program the technology is a supporting

145
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,920
aspect of that the IP addresses the
domain names the ashes those are just

146
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:26,550
part of it what intelligence allows is
providing the strategic advantage with

147
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:32,290
practical application being able to take
the fourth block and getting out in

148
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,660
front of those attacks in front of those
fishing campaigns out in front of those

149
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:46,360
scanning adversaries yes seven steps
when we're going to focus on today

150
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,600
talk about days more around the analysis
of that information and we have tons of

151
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,940
it available to us we're all doing
centralized logging right couple are

152
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,710
logs can tell us a lot of information
around some of the technical threats

153
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,650
that we're seeing within our
organization both at the perimeter and

154
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,480
Internet organization

155
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,160
however we definitely when it comes to
threat intelligence do not lack of

156
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,930
available data there is more information
that is available to us and present day

157
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:26,459
then there as ever been before however
being able to get through it and analyze

158
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:32,440
it requires that we leverage tools that
ensures that we have to have a proper

159
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:41,410
processes place prior to knowing that
are we can take all this information and

160
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:48,610
correlated with the technical aspects IP
addresses the domain names the Syrian

161
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,370
electronic army hasn't registered the
Syrian electronic army dot com have a

162
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:58,079
buddy know a little bit more subversive
in that right but we can take that type

163
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,370
of information related we can start
protecting our businesses little more

164
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:07,790
information is available in multiple
formats and often is freely available

165
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:15,519
and we can take these tools we can take
these sources of information these data

166
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:23,110
fees aggregate demand pull together some
of them are paid I highly recommend that

167
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,220
if you're going to pay for a data feed
that you do your due diligence you ask

168
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,240
hard questions but a sales engineer
today when it comes to threat

169
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,209
intelligence and is very hot topic then
everybody seems today is providing

170
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:48,329
direct relatives you have this guy and
we were running the help of us so he has

171
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:55,410
brought in what he calls a threat
intelligence service here in a few

172
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,100
ultimately we all know vendor speak
write what they say versus what they

173
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:06,919
mean when you thought about what he's
actually talking about is that he's

174
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,039
pulling the device logs off your
infrastructure that you've already paid

175
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:19,549
for the running open source tools love
the time everybody seems to build off of

176
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:27,289
the open source community and moving
forward but every year the private area

177
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:34,500
analysis techniques show actually know
what that means no they actually don't

178
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,520
understand the output of the tools but
because of the fact that the tool says

179
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:47,770
this it must be bad but he had the
global network censors right now that

180
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:56,429
actually translate still shots and again
your device logs and then they come back

181
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:05,280
and say you need for intelligence again
trying to sell raw data now one thing

182
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,240
that i would tell people when it comes
to intelligence ask one question and one

183
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:18,320
question along the benders why is it a
threat to me high financial services

184
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,880
industry I'm working at a bank and I
gotta say but I will fight of academia

185
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:36,400
the same thing in healthcare probably
not I tend to walk around with my cousin

186
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,650
and also I'm gonna take this off

187
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:49,600
so why is it a threat to me if you give
enter cannot answer that one simple

188
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,780
question and usually the the answer
should be a derivative we have done

189
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,770
analysis within that industry specific
to the organization that's ultimately

190
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,700
what it comes in because I organizations
differ so to the threats and not all

191
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:11,160
threats are equal so here we have to
threats which one is the bigger threat

192
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:30,250
do you think I left your left the cat so
just recently for those shoes this was

193
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,250
released recently from a ever sorry
known as sexy cyborg she printed out a

194
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:42,070
pair of high heels on a 3d printer and
batted balls I can be used for nefarious

195
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:47,670
purposes now for those of you are
wondering the one on the right

196
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:53,680
yes he has a threat just a different
type of threat again not all threats are

197
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:06,380
equal the threat organizations what's
absolutely they kinda made the news in a

198
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,980
bad way right now that they weren't
doing anything good to begin with but is

199
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,930
this a threat to our organization

200
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:21,310
absolutely what happens after a
large-scale data breach exploitation

201
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,790
watch now

202
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,120
budgets go up get me out of their
database now

203
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,990
so vulnerable to get information like
this as it becomes relevant and taking

204
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,210
action on it and ensure that your users
whether or not they're actually signed

205
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,770
up for it are aware not to respond to
emails like the US where they're being

206
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:55,650
black male however this is not one of
the traditional routes that are being

207
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:05,590
promoted again by my list of bad by my
list the bad stuff about its not gonna

208
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,740
protect you from these types of attacks
and has this threat to your organization

209
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,710
absolutely so now we're gonna move into
the necessity for analysis and why

210
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,809
analysis of data and information in a
whole is important as it allows us to

211
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:31,890
turn around and validate the information
on finding out whether it's a threat to

212
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:39,100
us we can turn around and stuff that
arise prioritize our resources because

213
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,730
we all have the unlimited resources has
reared to find early except for the guy

214
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,970
with the NSA and we can answer those
questions isn't a threat or organization

215
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,450
as a pose a risk to us now

216
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,250
ritually started this I mention that I
collected stuff and if you were here

217
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,490
last year I went through the entire
process of our process stuff so I got

218
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,059
all this information collected it

219
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:09,490
aggregated it and process I even went so
far as when a colleague of mine who

220
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,950
because how many of us are familiar
comfortable more comfortable of command

221
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,320
line

222
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,550
yeah that's right just management or
leadership comfortable a command-line

223
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,520
know so while I'm comfortable of
processing stuff and dealing with

224
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,210
information that actual Vegas I even
went as far as I started dash boarding

225
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:32,039
stuff how this looks really pretty right

226
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:41,739
and when I took an initial look at the
data do you know what I doubt however

227
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:45,950
that doesn't always mean that the
chicken shape country in the east is the

228
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:53,600
one responsible for it we apply a little
bit of analysis efforts behind it

229
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,450
we need to be able to take a look at the
data and no heaven forbid apply a little

230
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:08,279
clients are things there's a great quote
by colin powell comes to elephants tell

231
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,460
me what you know what you don't tell me
what you think

232
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,080
always distinguish between them which is
which we don't wanna make assumptions

233
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,739
when it comes to analysis and we
definitely don't want to step in front

234
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:31,619
of the Speaker Michael allow may be able
to to look at us where we need to

235
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:37,190
analyze the data to ensure that what
we're seeing is a factor and that we're

236
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:42,019
not jumping to conclusions

237
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:47,159
analysis leave your feelings out the
door

238
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,879
IP address from China must be China
right I love the shirt that I saw here

239
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:59,090
those that you can't always blame Canada
because you know it's it's so far out of

240
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:05,609
what we consider normal emphasized that
you know it just made me laugh

241
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:12,399
talk about analysis apply some science
maybe some math I hear that most schools

242
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:18,869
that our homeschool have these types of
things right

243
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:22,559
talk about the analysis of competing
hypotheses going back to the basic

244
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,530
scientific method and coming up with

245
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,680
what is the purpose of what has happened
and what are alternate hypotheses that

246
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,090
could be that could see TV model were
looking for

247
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:43,120
forces us to take a look at it look at
playing devil's advocate know putting

248
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,060
yourself in the position of regardless
of what you see

249
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,350
taking the opposite position to be able
to force and then drive those questions

250
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:56,980
and then red teaming putting yourself in
the adversaries minds up somebody try

251
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:07,390
some science like science is also so I
have to rather young ladies that are my

252
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:11,280
daughters when is a teen is horny and
when I invited him commander be kinda

253
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:18,150
like you're going down with a bunch of
nerds and geeks number 12 hackers and we

254
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:24,140
are the ones who are actually running
the world they did not want to hear that

255
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:35,240
so apparently 25 my young daughters my
daughter's jitters are still not science

256
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,090
however there's always gonna be one of
the mainstays for the basic science to

257
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:48,740
the method when it comes to dealing with
running to the ground truth I spent a

258
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:55,950
lot of time on this but you have to come
up with alternative hypothesis you can't

259
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:01,270
just believe automatically that because
the ip address comes from China China

260
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:13,700
whether he remembers the need for
objectivity challenge those assumptions

261
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,340
what we see is what we see actually what
it is or is there something deeper that

262
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,220
were missing

263
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,400
the mental mindsets we all have what's
called cognitive biases we have

264
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:34,320
automatic we created a what we expect to
see and what we're going to ultimately

265
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:41,340
fine we have to be able to get beyond
that ultimately this is for the purposes

266
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:47,760
of reducing the potential impact of
coming up with the wrong idea how many

267
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,240
of us have ever worked firewall
administration couple of us has anybody

268
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,520
ever made the you know when you're
reviewing the firewalls you see the one

269
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,539
IP address going to an unknown IP
address that we can account for so we

270
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:04,360
take the initiative to shut it down

271
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,400
how many others have ever accidentally
you know impact of the business by doing

272
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:16,960
that we want to reduce the chance of
surprise wanna run and get the ground

273
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,780
truth we want to understand and make
sure that what we're seeing is actually

274
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,020
the case anybody in here four million
with the analysis of competing

275
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:33,990
hypotheses so as to get over the biases
because of the fact that reasoning tends

276
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:41,900
to be subjective and insurers that we
come up we have alternating hypotheses

277
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,200
and this is a practical application that
we've actually recently done with a

278
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,419
client of ours when we are asked why do
you believe this so we actually model

279
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:57,960
that outperform based upon the different
hypotheses we actually created based on

280
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,570
the likelihood of an inventor Couric
this is why we believe this and the

281
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:07,919
evidence supports it so we're talking
about our biases IP address from China

282
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:16,309
must be china or cognitive biases the
human mind likes to see patterns that

283
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:21,910
may not always exist and we get focused
on some things

284
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:27,940
we want that we're talking about French
soldiers against jumping to conclusions

285
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:33,310
now one of the things I was like to do
his talking about the cognitive biases

286
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:52,230
when we see up here on the board yet
what we have on the car the far right

287
00:28:52,230 --> 00:29:19,520
right some see a tiger some 200 400 MHz
the upside man our minds have the

288
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,480
ability to find a pattern but yet some
of us only saw the tiger or some of

289
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,000
those only saw the monkey

290
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,150
force ourselves to be able to get out of
that mindset and break that pattern and

291
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:39,510
to be able to actually move forward from
it how many of you just see the school

292
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:46,280
one has anybody seen when with regards
to this cold they see the two girls

293
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:57,290
playing with toys this is important and
then threat intelligence because we want

294
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:03,200
to challenge to make sure that we're
actually seeing what you guys think

295
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,370
you'll be seeing calories now pacino
this morning right this is gonna be a

296
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:18,980
star studded presentation I do I do have
some great sponsors have simply picked

297
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,370
up on that yet

298
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:25,840
somebody asked me if I liked how did you
manage to get those sponsors and I'm

299
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:34,650
like they volunteered themselves the
devil's advocate and are the top man

300
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:39,430
rule being able to take the opposite
opinion regardless of what your personal

301
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:46,340
beliefs are on the situation and putting
yourself through force ought to crank

302
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:54,050
that area or that that situation where
it makes you think beyond the immediate

303
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,870
for those of you

304
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:00,080
anybody in here in a bit seeing World
War Z where they talked about the tenth

305
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:06,090
man rule and how how was it that Israel
is prepared for the zombies this is the

306
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:11,550
same thing when it comes to double to
advocate for the Taliban rule is no

307
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:17,200
matter what the the all the evidence
laid out take the position that it's not

308
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:25,370
right thing for starter Brett teaming
putting yourself in the mindset of the

309
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:31,160
adversary I do not know how many times I
work with an organization and they will

310
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:38,570
come back and they will be like all
nobody would ever do that to us why not

311
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:50,220
well that's an extreme we just make a
mars we have nothing here sealing the

312
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,370
way that criminal syndicates the way
there are adversaries view our systems

313
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,820
are businesses

314
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,740
is completely different than what we do
because they they have identified a

315
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:16,460
financial gain for exporting our system
testing commercially may be voluntary

316
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:24,649
has anybody ever heard their parents
come back and said you are so good or

317
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:27,809
not gonna be really that concerned about
it because you're so good nobody else

318
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:35,549
could find it we've all heard that right
that is management's dodger trying to

319
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:39,570
get out of it now we've taken over
networks I love to hear that cause I I

320
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:48,620
will look at them into farm boy was
sponsored and motivated by the poultry

321
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,700
some of the contract value I know what
you do professionally I know the value

322
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:02,389
your intellectual property he motivated
funded at the surgery will spend more

323
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:06,840
time than you know the 30 minute she
gave me on sunday morning between four

324
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:15,519
and 5 a.m. to execute and they will go
long haul they will go low and slow oh

325
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,470
and they will fish whereas you won't let
me because you already admitted that you

326
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:26,419
know we won't survive a phishing attack
but asking yourself questions one of the

327
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:31,240
motivations of the net your adversary
being able to talk about what their

328
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,240
resources are working with a client I
was cracking up to here and I T

329
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:42,629
department tell me we clean the systems
after a very large scale motivated and

330
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:49,100
funded at the surgery and I was like ok
let's let's stop for a second and get

331
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,740
back to reality

332
00:33:52,740 --> 00:34:00,290
this is a a very highly-skilled
organization that is trained to maintain

333
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:04,730
long-term persistence and organizations
to achieve their goals

334
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,909
please tell me for the love of all that
is holy what clean the system actually

335
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:19,490
means but we're only in certain
situations like that doesn't work they

336
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,460
actually thought that they can go in and
manipulate you know run the antivirus

337
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,700
you know run Symantec McAfee his first
game time apparently is how that turned

338
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,179
out

339
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:36,010
and that would magically claimed the
system's what they didn't understand is

340
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:43,950
that anti virus will not pick up no
authorized software like a gnat job that

341
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:50,690
the adversary creates back home and open
the back door backup why would anybody

342
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,950
catch that all because it's not a
malicious software

343
00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:01,350
well Microsoft and hope you sort of
malicious so let's talk a little bit

344
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,880
about brute force attacks you know a lot
of folks get in we talked and we see

345
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,250
these you know we see that our our route
accounts being just hammered away

346
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:18,440
outright does that surprise anybody now
they're going to try and go after the

347
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,830
the privileged accounts

348
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,210
well what about the not so privileged
accounts are we looking at those even

349
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:33,480
know because we aren't as sexy right
efforts must not be important for

350
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,010
whatever they actually going after we
start doing some analysis where find

351
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:43,040
some really interesting interesting
things were able to put some information

352
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,410
together

353
00:35:47,410 --> 00:36:01,510
now what purpose might an adversary have
interest in in a Polycom system is that

354
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,180
a good thing

355
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:09,930
charged long distance calls here over
here and that is are those bad things

356
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:17,840
are those rights organizations so by
doing a little analysis were able to see

357
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:25,640
what's on the attack patterns are diving
into the data we can actually see what

358
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:32,980
applications are actually using this
case is very specific the puddy puddy

359
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:39,510
SSH as we can see there's different
variants I never realized that someone

360
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:46,500
actually created a port present stage
and dotnet that's a really strange thing

361
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:54,180
to do but hey rock on I love this one is
why I started doing a little bit of

362
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,410
research around this very very small
attempt was an implementation Microlab

363
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:05,350
Dalal been research found out it talked
about in data bases and then my next

364
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:08,420
article that I came across this one

365
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,750
releasing at the school was your and
availability that could be easily

366
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:18,150
exported so I can probably make the
expectation that the Avatar The Last IP

367
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,470
address that was coming from

368
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,620
was probably not the actual attacker but
somebody had been compromised and they

369
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:29,270
were just for using the infrastructure
dealing with these types of brute force

370
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:35,120
attacks and we can tell the difference
by looking at them because now we can

371
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,220
tell whether or not their automated
attacks are not looking through our logs

372
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,460
we see thats right look the best night
old-line I was like you've got about

373
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,400
that sorry about that on your system
that's really changed testing systems

374
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,160
trying to get out how do you know that's
not a person

375
00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:03,890
a long time series I pointed out that 41
passwords attempted in the 62nd period

376
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,559
was not gonna happen unless

377
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:18,980
adversary was the flash could be
necessary any Marvel superhero fans case

378
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:26,240
study so a good friend of mine and
remorse provided this and if you haven't

379
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,780
worked with kept a 41 the unique
capabilities with TEPCO has the ability

380
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:38,030
to record what actually goes on so we
get the data coming through and we're

381
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:43,549
starting to notice what looks like a
common attack I want to watch this for a

382
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:59,720
few minutes late test scripts are bots
will back up so we've actually got a

383
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,420
live human officer which is really cool
when you think about it at the same time

384
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,299
it makes you want to break into the
session is heard talking to like how I

385
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:12,220
got you but we don't want to do that
because we want to be able to catch more

386
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:21,059
information now I can tell you just five
looking at this initially he's probably

387
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,000
not know your concept of honey pots
because he's been trying to run the same

388
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,869
comment over and over

389
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:35,350
uploaded the file

390
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:41,400
so

391
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:49,920
construction and analysis so we saw
download specific script in that domain

392
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,750
right that's cool do the same thing

393
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:02,750
Oh fYI going through this one of the
things I'm not a lawyer but when I give

394
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,440
legal advice I will tell you

395
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:11,590
copper copywriting your mouth we're not
a good idea now I could be wrong and

396
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,760
they could because now where does tend
to be reused it could be that I'm

397
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,230
mistaken but the more I'm looking at
this morning walking through it more

398
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,560
information we get now what was really
cool

399
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,240
was when I went out to the first website
and for those of you are wondering yes I

400
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,740
running back but was really cool

401
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:47,470
was the fact that my Mac was breached by
a system 32 dot exe problem which you

402
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,130
know that put the fear of God in me
because I mean if they're so good that

403
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:57,360
they were able to cause a system 32 exe
issue on it back that is just like

404
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:04,510
unbelievable

405
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,030
artillery search around some of the
information we found found out they have

406
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:14,740
their own YouTube channel that that's
pretty interesting little bit more

407
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,680
research now let's let's find out who
actually owns that because you're gonna

408
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,750
put in your mouth where we're going to
little research found out the individual

409
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,660
now it should never be this easy right

410
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:32,490
should we ended up looking up the IP
address

411
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,610
looks like it's coming out of Singapore
matches the domain that's the

412
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:45,740
information it's an actual VPS hosting
service that offers surprisingly very

413
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,990
low rates per night

414
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:54,610
wonder why so short doing some
additional information

415
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:59,940
looking for some some common factor some
some common analogy between the

416
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:06,480
information we're pulling together found
another demand that they owned so that

417
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,190
we can take that information and take
action on that as well

418
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:16,160
now can never get really that's easy I
mean we've found yet another YouTube

419
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,010
channel that he owns a very hot on
YouTube this was the best part was able

420
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:28,850
actually find his picture so another
thing about malware when you write it

421
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:36,660
don't reference yourself and don't put
your Facebook page in the malware that

422
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:42,240
might be bad that might be bad but being
able to find out and get to this level

423
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,570
of detail was only done through doing
the analysis thus becomes important

424
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:55,720
because as we drive through the analysis
it does bring business value and the

425
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,780
reason why it helps our organizations in
our leadership understand that what the

426
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:06,319
media is portraying as our adversaries
is not really the case

427
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:11,819
how many of us actually believe that we
are fighting you know a twelve year old

428
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:21,019
in their grandparents basement on their
laptop I think the best one so far today

429
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:30,920
to our industry is this one right here
so in 25 years and information security

430
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,769
I've never found a threat this easy to
find where it's just called out directly

431
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:46,109
in the code anybody else I do bad stuff
17 nor have I ever had nuclear reactors

432
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:55,309
explode on me I've never had to run an
adversary down wearing a vest or a bad

433
00:43:55,309 --> 00:44:01,019
to draw down at one in fact usually when
people talk with with folks in

434
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:07,739
information security specifically around
security operations and testing network

435
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:18,239
defense what they normally think of
right however this thanks to black hat

436
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:28,219
and Chris Hensley this is now what we
are my wife wish I was so what

437
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:31,930
leadership seems these they see the
movies and they think you know this is

438
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,609
our adversary the worst thing to our
industry to ever come out from a media

439
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:42,269
perspective CSI cyber because also all
cyber threats can be stopped and

440
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:48,309
rectified in under an hour why can't it
be this easy these are not the

441
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:54,979
adversaries we face are real adversaries
are insiders nation state criminal

442
00:44:54,979 --> 00:45:03,199
syndicates organizations that have
method opportunity skills motivation and

443
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,190
funding for bringing impact organization

444
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:13,030
the web has been weaponize and the wars
already going on we're seeing

445
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:20,750
organizations leveraging it more are
using a combined attacks are using it to

446
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:27,870
to actually make an influence
organizations that the sad part is this

447
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:35,070
is nothing new this has been going on
for several years but yet we keep not

448
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:44,700
wanting to accept any stock traders and
here I washed stock market anybody does

449
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:51,290
anybody know what this is very bad day

450
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,590
Pacific it was the result of a single
tweet

451
00:45:54,590 --> 00:46:06,930
one billion dollars were lost over 140
characters they didn't involve the whole

452
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:13,720
440 they weren't they were frugal with
are tweeting I might have heard that

453
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,010
there was an individual that was
involved that made a comment via Twitter

454
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:26,280
about a plane may be going sideways that
resulted in some questions this is the

455
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,880
working in this is the impact that it's
actually happen the cyber is going

456
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:40,160
kinetic I hate to use the term cyber but
why not it's Sunday morning so why is

457
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,160
this important and why now why a threat
intelligence becoming more and more

458
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,440
important and whys of more than just IP
addresses in whys of more than just

459
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,910
IOC's and how should the domain names

460
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:55,730
well this allows us to get out front
taking information in get out front of

461
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,660
these threats

462
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:03,140
we have a kind of have a responsibility
to protect organizations right i mean we

463
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:09,609
all get paid to protect organizations
maybe sometimes our customers would

464
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:17,410
really appreciate it if we protect their
information for real and they're not new

465
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:25,960
we've been saying attacks go on way that
could be your wake up call we've been

466
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:48,119
seeing these attacks go on for quite
some time we're not going to be in

467
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,819
business much longer

468
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:56,329
threat intelligence from a business
perspective and keeping in mind most

469
00:47:56,329 --> 00:48:00,980
business leadership doesn't really speak
technology we've been trying for years

470
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:06,020
to help it helped translate for them and
then educate them so I find it's easier

471
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:12,730
to talk America arms we can be able to
answer some strategic questions who

472
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:17,920
would be interested in us were very
large financial institution would

473
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,730
anybody be interested in us

474
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:25,700
yes yes they would start out why are
they coming after you you have money

475
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:33,760
when a point not a hard hard lesson to
learn where they're coming from

476
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,960
not china not of their financially
motivated

477
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,290
we gather some of the questions on how
they're coming after us and what we can

478
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:50,770
do to better protect ourselves
organization we do this for enhancing

479
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:55,930
our operations within daily business
providing increased situational

480
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:03,290
awareness you don't wanna fly to this
country today because it's bad or

481
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:07,080
country is out I ran

482
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:14,160
gender change our trouble understanding
the threats being able to convey that

483
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,420
back to the business of that they
understand that threat isn't just you

484
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:25,190
know packets on a firewall anymore it's
being able to take those resources and

485
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:32,200
prioritize to ensure maximum offensive
capabilities focus on other efforts in

486
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,860
response to identify Press alternately
you get to a point where you can

487
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:48,840
actually hug life of a tax hike by being
able to get in there and being able to

488
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,250
identify a threat to respond early on
your earlier we're able to catch the

489
00:49:54,250 --> 00:50:00,630
threat and respond to it the less the
impact organization how many are you

490
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:08,000
familiar with the culture we all write
filter and concepts for the most part we

491
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,050
can handle we we have no way of
influencing the first three variants

492
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,560
when it comes to reconnaissance
weaponization of delivery

493
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:26,460
we can moan that we have no influence on
that the good news is that doesn't cost

494
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:34,779
us

495
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:39,029
coming in or when the systems have been
exploited management roles been

496
00:50:39,029 --> 00:50:44,949
identified when there has been a trend
that's when the highest cost is going to

497
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:48,640
be and when that happens

498
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,949
may end up seeing this guy nobody wants
to see this guy he's going to tell you

499
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:57,979
you've got a large sum of money from me
or you're fired so ultimately what you

500
00:50:57,979 --> 00:51:07,659
want to get back to the original
question why is it a threat to me being

501
00:51:07,659 --> 00:51:14,609
able to address that getting to route
calls around why specific at the cereal

502
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:20,559
or a threat or an actor is a threat to
the organization to get to that level he

503
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:36,709
takeaways for today houses require the
start saying you are doing now says they

504
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:42,809
are properly trained every skill you
have to be objective nobody wants to

505
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,989
surround themselves by a bunch of people
that will always tell them that there

506
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:50,979
are you know lucky bunny unicorns and
rainbows everywhere that's not the

507
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:52,489
reality of the world we live in

508
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:57,599
we need people that are honest enough
and courageous enough but ultimately it

509
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:05,249
comes back to the city people
individuals to make sure go forward and

510
00:52:05,249 --> 00:52:09,839
with that i think im not have any
questions
