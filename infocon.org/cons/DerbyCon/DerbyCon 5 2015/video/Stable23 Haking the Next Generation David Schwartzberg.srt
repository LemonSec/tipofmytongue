1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,570
obvious you don't have the edge in a
given to get the giggles from reported

2
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:36,480
that it does otherwise yeah I'd start
recording in order to help Jack ok yeah

3
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,440
you know the fun just to hang the next
generation thanks for joining us today

4
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,800
in the cyber frontier here is our first
Star Trek mean right and sorry for using

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,180
cyber writer I'm sure you're not too
happy about it but life goes on and that

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:01,090
is the last Star Trek mean presentation
so my generation remembers when

7
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,049
technology was complex and had certain
kinds of basic skills right frank who

8
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:16,000
are these skills were things like
reading typing in patients but but today

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,470
but today through mobility and
consumerization righty this current

10
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:38,050
generation they don't have those
requirements

11
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:51,050
gets ok to share your passcode with
people so we know better but he's so

12
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:57,010
last year when my son was to any really
didn't speak that much and then he had a

13
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,560
tablet he was getting in to YouTube and
other things that are on their goodwill

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,140
bility and the ability just do certain
things without needing tech support when

15
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,649
we put a passcode on it he learned the
pass code which is really cool but today

16
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:20,660
he still receives it out loud on that so
hard to that though is just kids are

17
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,740
wired to learn and if it's something
that's fun for them they're gonna do it

18
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,670
and they gonna get really good at it
when I think back to my youth and

19
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,890
frankly I used to spend a lot of time
reading these tones it had tables and

20
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,670
matrices in them that we're pretty
complex pretty dry in order to play

21
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:47,290
Dungeons and Dragons a little better
because an incentive had a hard time

22
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:53,510
focusing on my education because there
really was no incentive for me and

23
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:04,020
that's why we created have four kids so
you believe we're responsible teach the

24
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,270
next generation than you and I have a
lot of it is our responsibility to teach

25
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,130
this generation Internet safety best
practices and give them a safe

26
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,580
environment to explore step which is
science technology engineering and make

27
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,000
it fun to use what they're wired for
their own good

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,580
whether they like it or not so little
bit more about you know how the case was

29
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:40,519
created when it started to have you back
in 2013 I see this Tweet go out with a

30
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,880
few people's names on the other you see
who wanted to start thought con kids

31
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,710
and furlough time deep inside of me and
burn and to create a condo to do

32
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,460
something like something like that we
can just bring your community together

33
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,520
but he didn't really know what it was in
there was really no need to create a

34
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,780
common issue so I was thinking about
these things like swap meets in bringing

35
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,910
that back but I just and then when I saw
this I was like that's what you want to

36
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,190
do so I contacted them and was very
excited when they accepted the fact that

37
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,640
I could be the fifth person help
organizing this event that really kind

38
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:26,040
of spoke to me in a way being a parent
30 thoughts on board got together and

39
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,410
they decided they really don't want to
expand into a kids event so that fire

40
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,270
inside of me was burning but it kind of
went to a smoldering still wanting to do

41
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,230
something like this I just got home my
head for a while and wondered on it

42
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:49,680
until then one day I said so I contacted
them and they were cool with it he said

43
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,910
go for it and we created have three kids
in 2014 and this is the opening

44
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,810
ceremonies from last year in chicago the
synagogue and it was great we had a good

45
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,360
amount of attendance we had a lot of
kids it learned it had a lot of other

46
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,890
things that we had there with things
like homemade hand in their robot

47
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,720
garbage can and payload somewhere
between 0 and a tablet showing our

48
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,640
website we also were able to get a
donation from a link over the creator of

49
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,900
the award-winning Snap Circuits are not
obligated by contract say that I see

50
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,150
true and the kids had a great time
learning electrical engineering

51
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,680
then this year one of the things that we
were one of the kids came to me with

52
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,350
some friends to a scavenger hunt this
year and I think about it will come up

53
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,440
with something to prove that UPS and 3d
cases road we knows we put the items

54
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,860
that need to be found on the Arduino and
in the schedule just set it up to use

55
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,410
morse code of the kinda got stuck and
they need to go find it they had to

56
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:49,740
learn

57
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,800
Morse code teaching them to have to do
something which is kind of like a dying

58
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,060
skill he knows Morse code from memory

59
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,729
see nobody raised their hands you know
what it is but nobody knows it and

60
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,449
that's one of the things I want to do
kind of like revitalizing and they loved

61
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,889
it had a great time and here's a picture
of the wildly successful technology

62
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:19,949
destruction essentially we're teaching
them technology reverse engineering so I

63
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:23,610
remember as a kid taking apart that
large piece of furniture my parents have

64
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,180
they called a TV which I took the back
off and I started pulling out all the

65
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,389
transistors the first time I did it may
just turn the TV off and burned myself

66
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:39,120
there was no meant to around say you
should wait for those bullets to unplug

67
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:50,970
the TV it was yes they would be so I
yeah I learned some lessons and so in

68
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,400
this environment or even now so if you
give your smartphone or tablet or laptop

69
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,940
whatever don't take it apart right we're
here we're seeing take it apart

70
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,830
go ahead nobody is gonna we want you to
do it conceivably think one of the only

71
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,759
injuries with somebody who got cut but
it was so really which is a good thing

72
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:23,490
in my opinion that they got hurt I hope
you understand what a little bit more

73
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,659
what is hacked version foremost we we
think it's important that we're charity

74
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:35,990
registered public 513 charity so that
means that not everything that we bring

75
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,440
in donations thanks

76
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,400
the people who were out there bring in
donations to help us we're just giving

77
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,060
it back to the kids and it gives a
certain tax benefits because we're

78
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,880
really not trying to make a profit this
is really about giving back to the kids

79
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,530
as much as we can and again the simple
mantra this is a real takeaway someone

80
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,990
says oh you know what is a cricket it's
a conference for kids to teach them

81
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,950
Internet safety and best practices while
exploring science and technology I think

82
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,650
that's really the the simplest and
easiest way to explain it so that when

83
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:18,230
you get a really cool things is the
community that burning inside me to take

84
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,550
on it really didn't know too many people
familiar faces I really wasn't in the

85
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,800
community and once they start to trust
you and it does take some time they open

86
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,460
themselves like the kimono is wide open

87
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:47,210
you have a right to Franks kimonos gonna
be open up later so that the truth so

88
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,190
here we are able to partner with circles
in Econ this year so we did a lite

89
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,450
version of the village so parents
dropping the kids off and kids are just

90
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,290
exploring standing there doing stuff and
they were in a junior CTF where they

91
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,110
were winning prizes and had a great time
we provide incentives we gave them a

92
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,600
safe place to learn and we're just
basically using their natural curiosity

93
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,190
got the better so we were in
Indianapolis next week we're gonna be in

94
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,540
Ghent Belgium in partnership with which
I'm really excited about this is now

95
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,030
it's the first actor kids done in
another language is not English it's

96
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,770
gonna be in touch in French

97
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,760
basically useless as we speak English so
the staff speak English but all the kids

98
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,470
I can say you know something high in the
AM I get it I think it's really cool

99
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,270
that we're gonna have all the content
into French they have the content there

100
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:46,530
and even I save it securely online
presentation is gonna be done in both

101
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,370
languages we also partner with the folks

102
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,839
Grand Rapids and we're gonna be there on
October 10th on Saturday in

103
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,040
juxtaposition with the regular
conference of the volunteers are in this

104
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,160
room right now thank you for your
support is without the volunteers none

105
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,339
of this would happen it's everybody's
contribution that brings us together you

106
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:14,220
know now inside of you you have that
same kind of burning desire where you

107
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,960
want to start your own condo yuri havoc
on and you want to add this to your well

108
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,160
don't do it alone

109
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,740
use our use the lessons that we've
learned to help it make it easier for

110
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,610
you and there's just certain things
related to child safety and to some best

111
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,170
practices that we've learned that you
can also benefit from without making

112
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,730
things so we have a Google formats
available online

113
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,440
don't worry about writing this down a
president can be available to sell being

114
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,430
recorded just got to enjoy the
presentation for what it is now but

115
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:52,339
unfortunately that's about the length of
your entire thing to do for me to finish

116
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:55,490
it off but if you want to give me your
card today after this presentation we

117
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:01,020
can exchange to email and have a
conversation now at Hector kids having

118
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,450
gotten the message yet we take use
protection

119
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:12,260
very very seriously and is one of my
other kids playing a video game but we

120
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,029
really mean by use protection is a lot
of my training also comes from the Boy

121
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:23,529
Scouts of America of the BSA Scouter I
have to get trained every two years I

122
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,709
have to keep it current in order to be
so rest assured someone like me use

123
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:34,709
protection like me is also being
monitored by another organization that's

124
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:41,410
greater than for kids but some of their
principal their fundamentals adopted so

125
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,150
for example one of them

126
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,209
leadership think about it maybe if you
have the same exact meaning or somebody

127
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,120
has a different that really means a
two-to-one reach you

128
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,080
is always going to be no less than two
adults one kid where it gets indexed to

129
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,370
actually really protect both sides
already so if you ever have a one-to-one

130
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,779
situation it's your word against theirs
and more than likely the kids words

131
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:14,779
gonna be taken to be the true so that's
why we do it's to protect the adults as

132
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,710
well then you get the situation where
the restrooms

133
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,540
it's really kind of you go into a
restroom there's a kid you walk around

134
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,160
you week if you're in the rest as a kid
you hurry up and finish the business and

135
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,310
get out you know right now when it comes
to volunteers we're very very careful

136
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:41,070
about the volunteers as well you have to
be vetted by someone on the board or

137
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,510
someone thats on staff in order to
become a volunteer for kids online form

138
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:52,100
it's always a bit but it's not public we
don't want to have to go through and

139
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,020
every single person it's really true
either someone that knows somebody from

140
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,250
your way more than a year and not just
once a year Derby Conn I think you're

141
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,560
pretty good person I trust you will not
that simple

142
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,380
somebody that we don't really have
someone involved in the community if

143
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,630
they're doing something with a
third-party organization like a soccer

144
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,779
coach organization every year and makes
them go through their willing to write a

145
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,860
letter to say yes we've known Bob for
five years and bobs great around the

146
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:29,709
kids and Bob could then potentially be a
happy to hear this guy may not qualify

147
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:37,300
photography there's another thing that
we have a strict policies on as well

148
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,200
why we do have staff photographers and
parents have phones we do communicate

149
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,640
with the parents in the beginning of the
conference and it's really important

150
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,380
that if they're totally picture of their
tire oh and explain what that word means

151
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,550
shortly

152
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:55,060
other kids are other Tyros are out of
range or wait until that you know it's

153
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,430
just there kiddo just gonna change it
because we don't want anyone to be used

154
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,089
in any situation of doing anything that
they did not have any amount and is very

155
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:08,329
easy these days with socially correct so
even the staff photographers they might

156
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:11,839
take frontal photos as well as their
instructed to take more back or side

157
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,130
shots so that we can use that in any
like documents or on their website to

158
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,200
show people like a little on the tires
are having this particular example

159
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,750
nobody knows who the styro is probably
maybe his friends siblings and parents

160
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,750
or relatives right nobody is there busy
doing something that's really cool has

161
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,620
the latest circuit to shoot a propeller
off and then he's got an Arduino in

162
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:41,670
front of probably did the Morse code to
sorry there is another example is a

163
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,970
curly hair tire oh we don't know if
that's a boy or girl is a great perfect

164
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:53,390
example but there's a parent helping the
kids with project so moving on to

165
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,720
something else as cool as 3d printing is
one this year we decided to do something

166
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,560
a little fun and we printed their badges
for them so we sat down with designer

167
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,920
bag was actually but then it really
worked out and give them the the glider

168
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:13,380
symbols on their thoughts but then we
created a simple specifically for them

169
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:21,360
and it's called so Tyrone means novice
your learner but we don't want to use

170
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,500
that so we went with Cairo which is a
genuine word and

171
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,000
when I was trying to figure out what the
symbol can look like I came across the

172
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,980
arrow which is a Nordic let her meaning
shrink warrior and its cold tire

173
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,560
to finish off the look forward and
circles grow but now in addition to

174
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,970
shrink them warrior the circle
represents the unity of the hacker

175
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,460
community

176
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,740
laugh and his never-ending thirst for
knowledge so I think it's really cool

177
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,710
and it belongs to the tire there's
badges do not have this if your child or

178
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:08,210
tarlow speaker you get this on your
speaker bad it's pretty cool stuff I get

179
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:17,120
chills talking about and it's upside
down so when you saw the previous upside

180
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,570
down since when they hold their bad
you're looking at it it's a bright to

181
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:30,800
them secret codes of upside down they
don't know what it is gone so why you

182
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,280
where kids so if you've heard of DEFCON
kids which is now roots asylum great

183
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,460
conference the opportunity to go and I
was guided around I had a tour guide

184
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,050
with me he did not let us wander alone
before the kids wake conference but

185
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:55,690
they're only once a year in Vegas kids
is based out of San Jose another great

186
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:03,820
but they're also once a year in San Jose
so what's the common denominator their

187
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:10,920
west coast so pack for kids is really
intend to be global we're building a

188
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:17,750
global do you see a more familiar brand
whatever you think of the idea here is

189
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,120
to have it available to anyone who wants
to do this

190
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,950
globally

191
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,980
so we started in Chicago we went to
Indianapolis going to Grand Rapids and

192
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,270
we're going again

193
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:34,960
wanna do something also in your area let
us now will talk to you now think that's

194
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,180
labeled to hear some of the content that
we do have tickets to the presentations

195
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:47,470
they're all the ideas really have youth
based presentations or someone who's a

196
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:53,120
new speaker or an established speaker or
just has a really good idea to share it

197
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,860
that's what we're about

198
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:01,240
but we don't have aged women so
regardless if you're eighty your welcome

199
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,500
to present at how the kids if it's
appropriate for that age group but we do

200
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,510
encourage younger speakers because we
just feel that generation gap generation

201
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,680
is it gonna be a lot stronger we have
activity station so this is the stem

202
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,260
activity station but we can do anything
for Python for kids

203
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:28,020
village spider-man he told you gonna be
doing like crypto in number theory be

204
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:35,400
allowed to just hold a wide range of
things and we try to change it up so

205
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,130
every year we keep the Snap Circuits and
stuff that we know people over the

206
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,780
terrors love like technology destruction
village I know I like clothes and stuff

207
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,800
but we can we change it up so it's
interesting

208
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:54,480
workshop will do workshops and he was
gonna workshop to share in Chicago so we

209
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,330
do workshops and those are more
concentrated the activity stations are

210
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,990
really designed to be about 20 minutes
or 90 these are usually at least two

211
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:09,040
hours and then we have a mandatory safe
and secure online presentation here is

212
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,120
Robert Wagner the board members
delivering the same safe and secure line

213
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,110
visitation alliance with ice and he's
talking about specifically here

214
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,090
anti cyberbullying that kind of talk to
our Internet safety and best practices

215
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,400
no back to this young man so you guys
know he's speaking here i think is

216
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:37,450
actually speaking right now he was our
very first keynote room appropriate to

217
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,910
deliver their very first keynote and a
nine year old focused on cyber

218
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:47,980
protection for kids and I was great it
was so well received the kids loved it

219
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:55,340
ago and she's pretty cool and they were
younger older than him there like that's

220
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,040
kind of what we want we wanted a night
that fire inside of them that might have

221
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:06,230
been smoldering and in this particular
recycling images this one in the stem

222
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,490
station Kiro is learning how to build a
catapult popsicle sticks of glue gun

223
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,350
rubber band and a plastic spoon it
sounds like what they're actually

224
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:21,200
building this be built these catapults
and we didn't know this was

225
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,530
unanticipated when they started having
some sort of balling up little pieces of

226
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,550
paper and then having a competition who
can shoot I thought that was pretty cool

227
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:35,470
actually using what they built and then
they get to take it home and the

228
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,450
marshals or whatever it there so early
and so this was the sheets we provide a

229
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,130
sheet we have some instruction just kind
of step through a good idea of what

230
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,300
needs to do what they need to do and in
this particular case if you see like the

231
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,480
gear and that little circle there again
going back to Scouting if they're going

232
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,900
to do something so if they're scout and
you can also earn achievements towards

233
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:07,540
their standard just saying hey what the
heck am a certified or registered call

234
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,470
it counsel in Illinois counselor in
Illinois and become the main tour later

235
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,330
which just means of projects with this
magazine I know they did this in this is

236
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,160
what the qualifications are the parents
love it is a kid is good to go

237
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,640
if you have a question I gotta take it
later cuz the time but definitely in the

238
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,430
workshop will face teaching them web
application pen testing he's using all

239
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:40,090
the tools a regular web at Penn test
adverts we're running and the kids are

240
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,880
learning how to analyze all the traffic
and stopped the request and then monitor

241
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,010
the response he gave me challenge after
the course is over he said whoever would

242
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:59,220
be able to figure out how to pee into
the response we get a prize and two kids

243
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,760
did it

244
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:08,110
googled it had to do it and gift cards
but I'm happy to I'm incredibly happy to

245
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:14,640
know that was really good works guys
doing a Raspberry Pi workshop for us and

246
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:23,060
it's gonna call because not only they
know they're gonna learn Robotics robot

247
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:31,960
like beginning robotics mean how cool is
it comes to the pipe station on time so

248
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,790
it gives the Python for kids station
again it's building on the knowledge

249
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:41,870
they never used Python before a concept
in an exercise ball on the concept is

250
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,860
another exercise until they get to a
point where they're actually doing some

251
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,060
challenges and when they complete the
challenges to get a token of some kind

252
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,170
of recognition which is an entry into
the drawing at the end of the day where

253
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,100
they can win some prizes anything from a
$10 gift card

254
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,910
all the way up to have their own virtual
minecraft server or $150 snaps are

255
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,830
giving away some big prizes and then
here's some other challenges like the

256
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,270
Fibonacci series was an interesting one

257
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,990
now what if the kids the tyro

258
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,090
maybe we have a library online content
in 2014 they can go on there and do

259
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,270
something challenging the continent when
this year is over

260
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,420
get it done before the new year is gonna
take all the 2010 content and make it

261
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,040
available can keep expanding on this
library not just for kids who went there

262
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,910
to do a review but what about the kids
who can't make it for whatever reasons

263
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:43,380
may be here is a learning and education
opportunity now the prices we giving a

264
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:50,480
talk about the price is the incentive
heart that's $150 retail kit we gave two

265
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,070
of those away so far that's pretty cool

266
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,800
considering its a $40 ticket for the key
to enter

267
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,650
we partnered with her partner with no
starch press they gave us a bunch of

268
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:08,890
books was a dreary accelerate his kids
can learn even more in some other schwag

269
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:14,610
you like stickers in some way or do we
know how they got to the user and then

270
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:20,690
some of them to walk away with a custom
tyro for kids case which is pretty cool

271
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:30,130
and then who knows what this is its Dec
darknet badge so last year when I was

272
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,780
able to bring back a couple of them and
we gave away her kids and the kids love

273
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,500
him is it $20 soldering kit project
going to the kids pick discover the

274
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:47,210
hundred and fifty dollars and his dad
was like you know you want that way it

275
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,420
was kinda cute but he got what he really
wanted which was that kid and the parent

276
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:58,160
was pretty happy because they say the
toll on the folks at GDC dark awesome

277
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:04,230
they gave us several more badges this
year and next so we go to brew Congo

278
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,830
have a couple to give away in a girl
comes to give away and even more for

279
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:13,670
next year which I get chills when I say
that because they're just awesome

280
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:22,880
the road so how do we know how well it's
a hard thing to know so first you got

281
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,120
the safe and secure online presentation
right what does that mean how do we know

282
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,500
if this feedback you don't know somebody
tell your story that yet its work and

283
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,090
got me out of this situation but we
don't know but it's hard and we're

284
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,630
trying to figure that out surveys
another way challenged surveys is

285
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:45,520
sometimes people filling out quickly and
data is wrong for example the first item

286
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,580
there is how many how many hectic and
attended I asked my nine year old da me

287
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,630
an answer that I was expecting not to
malign my wife and kids she watches this

288
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:00,950
which different answer she read it
differently that's a challenge if you do

289
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,340
surveys you gotta tested on different
people people just putting a number for

290
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,030
likewise number 41 they thought that
meant we were kids that were there I was

291
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,000
not expecting and then there's just a
series of ways to make it easy for them

292
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,040
give them something to circle

293
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,870
another problem with that some of the
kids go to one workshop and allowed to

294
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,780
go to one with the circled an answer for
both

295
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:31,530
normalize that show you some of the
stats put together here and we're almost

296
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:39,720
done so this year we had 53 participants
was about 20 percent growth from last

297
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,590
year we had forty kids registered but
actually 38 showed up this year we had

298
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:51,130
53 registered and I think we actually
had 53 show up pretty good so you could

299
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:58,880
see the gender breakdown 39 boys 14
girls 36 always worth it was their first

300
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,150
time attending and for twelve girls it
was their first time attending two girls

301
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,380
two boys second time attending a hack
for kids one kid has gone to all three

302
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,570
dozen related

303
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:15,200
the age range is interesting because it
tells us all we talking to the right

304
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,070
audience is this appropriate for
teenagers we had a really low number of

305
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:26,090
teenagers do another one that's specific
to teenagers were you know we're just

306
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:31,290
not getting to the high schools soon
enough

307
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:36,280
nations outpace their popularity the
technology destruction village most

308
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,470
popular everybody loved it got a bunch
of fives most attended lockpicking

309
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,740
village doesn't want to pop a lot
especially when you're young you don't

310
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,050
want to we do want to get your first
level security right you see a lot can

311
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,310
you want to know how it works you wanna
get past it specially if there might be

312
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,530
something behind it that you don't think
so

313
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,940
20 K kid went to the lockpicking village

314
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:10,830
12518 him pop all the pins before that
616 pin and only one of them before it

315
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,730
and then you can see nine kids pop the
cops but one kid went right to the cuffs

316
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:21,370
the cops and they never did anything
interesting interesting data network

317
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:26,250
security section 209 kids of the nine we
had 92 all exercises and then there was

318
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:34,650
a hidden challenge and those we had
seven of nine sorry that I thought for

319
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:42,460
kids 10 kids showed up at an old old in
the first three exercises to only able

320
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:49,110
to finish the second challenge the
g-series none of them got by Matt crypto

321
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:54,380
did it to actually provided proves we
did not ask for proof but to did it

322
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,760
that's really interesting technology
destruction village 14 kids went there

323
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,900
are five of them identified all the
components but like all of them

324
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,980
capacitor was again more interesting
data here are some people had a really

325
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:15,640
good time the data back to wrap up you
want to do your own happy kids talk to
