1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,889
alright so my name is Timothy D Block
welcome to the blue team 30 hit rental

2
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:13,660
there is a very basic talk this is for
iced teas

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:20,080
professionals with limited resources in
both time money people a lot of the

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,359
tools I have used here and you know I
sound very effective and useful when I

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,610
don't want to share with the community
yeah I'm speaking on my cover or she

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,280
does she believe it I do have a pod just
got to study at the PVC security podcast

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,460
in the exploit information security
podcast and I mention those because a

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,210
lot of these tools I found on listening
to podcasts and pretty much podcasts

9
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,879
addict i dont always I may come but I
also listened to home security weekly

10
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,710
being one that I found some some of
these tools that a tech project which

11
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,969
will be going through is one of those
tools that I heard on the security

12
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,199
weekly podcast and I was given a
challenge to start doing some have sex

13
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:10,229
at my organization that was a great
resource for that so I have worked for

14
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,369
the state of South Carolina for the last
seven years

15
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,990
any government employees know that as a
state employee you have limited

16
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:23,259
resources and both time money and people
so but we still gotta get a job to do so

17
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:27,900
this is why I want to create this talk
is getting a lot of other people out

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,479
there they could use these tools so
several the challenges that I was given

19
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,860
included you know research finding out
about these tools research in them

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,110
staying up with some of the latest
information security news application

21
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,420
security you know we're getting infected
with malware why we get infected with

22
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,549
malware what can we do to improve upon
that and you know we know Adobe Flash

23
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:57,570
has come out with its $7 billion in the
last week that we patched that

24
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,990
an easy way not easy problem to solve
and sometimes expensive if you wanna go

25
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:09,070
to talk to some of the vendors there so
right there are all the tools to

26
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:17,480
straight up Google Twitter us that I
proxies maintenance red line tool and

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,600
Microsoft's enhancement gatien
experience toolkit otherwise known as

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:29,090
Emmett and then admin arsenals PDQ
deploy so the first challenge I was

29
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,950
given was research I don't think this
will be a surprise to anyone

30
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,650
this is the tool number 12 a choice for
ITV professionals everywhere and that's

31
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:43,670
Google you know using Google Dorking
which is a lot of security professionals

32
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,390
know about but there's also little
things techniques that you can do with

33
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,450
Google for example if you search for a
specific tools you gonna get a lot of

34
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,550
emphasis SEC and the sentence later
there's the word tools for quotations

35
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,300
around that you're gonna really refine
your search to any any heads with

36
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,870
InfoSec tools in that order

37
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,690
so really learning how to manipulate
Google to improve your search processes

38
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,890
is very important for you know research
and stuff and and discovering stuff

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,650
there's no really damn I think Google is
pretty straightforward so challenge ever

40
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:30,880
to strike intelligence yeah ok says
Google hackers Google hacking for

41
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,190
penetration testers 2005 version ok
thank you for that

42
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,780
of anyone got any tools that can help
with that you know this is being

43
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:47,070
recorded and let's get that out their
threat intelligence is you know you

44
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,709
gotta keep up with him four seconds and
ever-changing thing so you need to

45
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,980
really keep up with that and I found
twitter twitter is is really free you

46
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,130
can set up lists if you need to restart
a local user but I used that to just

47
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,680
follow 400 information security
professionals so when something happens

48
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,370
like hacking team getting four hundred
gigabytes of their internal data chopped

49
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,080
on the Internet

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,970
everyone's been talking about that
there's there's a ton of fun from that a

51
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,840
lot of snark there's a lot of fun
comments but as you can see appear

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,979
there's a lot of people doing analysis
on the data in starting on this they

53
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:29,970
discovered three adobe has two or three
doubles on abilities in that internal

54
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,190
database error in that turn internal
data ok let me know followed up you will

55
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,220
find out when they're gonna be reading
the news new vulnerability tests I go

56
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:46,440
patch on my machines in the agency also
I've really found use from Twitter when

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,140
all the OpenSSL bugs came out

58
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,280
heart bleeds probably the first one that
said that off a lot of people discussing

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,030
it was also very hard to ignore

60
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,350
so when something big happens you can
see a lot of people talking about a lot

61
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,770
of people discussing it you can ask
questions of people they're gonna be

62
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,000
sharing links Sharon tools I was able to
find some tools some Python tools that I

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,620
was able to then run against my websites
to find out if its

64
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,470
if they're vulnerable so Twitter can you
know don't like Twitter yes there is

65
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,600
drama but you can like any other
appliance you can tune it out you can

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,889
people are sharing pictures of their
kids too much and not really giving you

67
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,880
much value can unfollow people so she is
very much up to you and how to control

68
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,040
it and it's true of course it's for sure
behavioral data but my third challenge

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,539
was a security so I was tasked with we
got its start doing security assessments

70
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:49,650
on all our applications go do don't have
no idea how to do that like I mentioned

71
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,310
on security cleared them talking about
said it said they said at a proxy also

72
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:00,000
known as they put that out for anyone
that doesn't know open web application

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,050
security project is a non-profit open
source community so you can get a lot of

74
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,139
invaluable tools there for web
application security is being one of

75
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:16,440
them and there's that's the interface
right there so would you want to do is

76
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,700
you first wanna set up as a as a proxy
and then you want to click on everything

77
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,330
within the application click on every
link fill out every form submit

78
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,710
everybody and then from there you can
start using some of the the automated

79
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,620
tools that they have their I don't know
how big that is I hope you can see that

80
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,960
but essentially from there you spider
decide you can do a check spider for

81
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,789
Ajax type of content there is a force to
browse

82
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:50,410
which will you know has a list of
directories and it'll go out and look

83
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,870
forward and directories you takes a long
time depending on how big of a list you

84
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,039
have that hasn't default but like
anything in that it has a lot of

85
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,620
granular control so you can get some
low-hanging fruit then from there you

86
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,090
can really start digging into as you
start using it more digging into it the

87
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,510
other tool that I I forgot to mention
again this is bird sweet I think if

88
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,289
you're going into web application
security burbs we'd is the tool of

89
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:17,370
choice

90
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,220
zap has I think been catching up in
terms of usability

91
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,980
the downside to burp suite is that is at
$300 your subscription is that is

92
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,270
completely free

93
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,130
I've had developers start using SAP
because we put the city and their

94
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,890
process and you know it's kinda like a
test so they want to figure out what

95
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,240
their get wrong and so I started working
with them and I was surprised when they

96
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,190
came back and said we're starting to run
their own reports and I don't need to go

97
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,000
through and COS but the burp addition
you have struggled a little bit you get

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,210
the free version but struggle is not
ronald so you can give it to them and

99
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,100
let them go go go play with it you know
your web developers using a two legs app

100
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,850
is just just makes the process go a lot
smoother and it's a lot more value out

101
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,800
of it they they find the problem before
they get to you so after you done after

102
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,500
kinda mapped out the application you can
run ActiveX scan as it and as you can

103
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,450
see there in the active can you it
starts running through several different

104
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,360
techniques a path traversal remote file
inclusion cross-site scripting

105
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,100
releases the top 10 every few years
although I don't change and everything

106
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,320
they released it has really changed all
that much but it runs through all that

107
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,440
for you she takes forever be at gatien
is going to take a few minutes to a few

108
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,659
hours and then we can get this nifty
generate this report here which can be

109
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,920
you know you can take this is an HMO
report they have an XML report so that

110
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,330
you can put that into something like the
pics or trade is there some kind of

111
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,390
tracking applications and keep track of
this stuff because it's one of the first

112
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,530
things I found out was we'd have this
but it wasn't feasible to fix it at that

113
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,930
time we had you know couple months from
now we'll go back and fix it but it's

114
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:11,080
upon me to go back and make sure that
thing like to try to fix as a community

115
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,920
version enterprise version implement
that really check the stuff but what's

116
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,720
great about this report is that you can
take this HTML reporting you to

117
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,459
developers and start working on some of
those problems

118
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,420
before you do that don't make sure
there's a it shows you the URL that's in

119
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,559
there the description of the attack and
then the attack itself

120
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,290
you want to verify and confirm his appt
is not perfect it does have false

121
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,829
positives in need to go in there

122
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:43,779
confirm that it was found was actually
there might not necessarily being and

123
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:49,730
it's also got links and references and
all sorts of sorts of goodies there so

124
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:56,709
one of the so I did you know along with
the confirming part I did have some SQL

125
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:01,839
injection confirmed the developer didn't
necessarily believe me so I took him

126
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,600
over to the computer and they said you
know I showed them and the technique and

127
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,519
they said something pretty pretty
amazing to me which was hackers are so

128
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,869
smart so you know that the developers if
you're willing to give them time and

129
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:21,300
work with them they're they're very much
they want to get it right to just like

130
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,910
we did so much for challenge was
forensics or getting these stock alerts

131
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,189
within the state there's a there's a
state idea that monitors all the traffic

132
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:35,179
of all the agencies and we get rid of
stock alerts so initially were just

133
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:40,499
Raymond James off but we decided we want
to look into what what's actually

134
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:44,029
getting us infected what are people
going to can we implement some kind of

135
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:48,959
Defence's or you know change some kind
of web filter rule or something to to

136
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,799
stop some of these infections and that's
where men in red line that then there is

137
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:00,319
the alternate told this is volatility
I've never used the hotel room and Iran

138
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:04,230
is something that I've got real familiar
with its a free tool you can just do a

139
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,529
google search for and go download it all
these tools are very well documented as

140
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:13,709
well document redlining and just about
everything so it's pretty easy to start

141
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:20,769
downloading and using and so once you
build out your packages as the folder

142
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:26,569
structure all you really have to do is
click on the run red line script there

143
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:30,439
at the bottom of the batch file and
it'll probably command prompt and

144
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:35,459
depending on how how much processing the
computer has and how many miles are on

145
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:39,919
the system it'll go through go out and
collect all the events from the machines

146
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:45,069
are registered registry settings
browsers event details all that stuff in

147
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:49,790
a report in one place for you so you run
run that and then you're gonna open

148
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:57,720
previous analysis and you'll be able to
open up that session file and it'll do

149
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,519
some more analysis on the actual session
file itself you click on I'm

150
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:12,529
investigating a host base on external
investigation Lee and there you have the

151
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,360
layout there everything within a time
period so what you want to do is a time

152
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,459
when call option you said it to like a
two to five minute period cuz right

153
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:25,779
there that's that's about a 22 minutes
on either side of a time period I have

154
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:31,220
742 items to go through so if I don't
have an exact time I have to you know

155
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,279
really kinda expand that out a little
bit but you can get pretty pretty big

156
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:42,470
into that so one of my wins from this
was we had a phishing email come in

157
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:48,079
hit thirty different users seven people
know I'm sorry eight people the

158
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,339
seven-person send it to their manager
and clicked on the attachments we had a

159
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:57,360
total of eight people open up the
attachment luckily we had our users are

160
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,879
very good reporting that kind of stuff
they open the command prompt command

161
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,410
prompt flash and then went away so it's
pretty pretty obvious and luckily our

162
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,040
pay attention but we took the red line
to put it on the first couple found out

163
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,119
that it exceeds the file had been
dropped within the windows temp folder

164
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:19,570
so we will remove that nothing else was
installed ur done so

165
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,230
we were pretty confident that we had
gotten infection 8 users having a

166
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,570
reimage um it's gonna take you know two
to three days if it's all aidid wants

167
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:34,940
you know we have guys doin PC refresh of
dredging machines could be so this was

168
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:41,230
all within one Friday and we were able
to get everyone back to work so the

169
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,600
other one is on top of that how do we
keep these machines from getting

170
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,570
infected around you and our organization
we've finally got rid of Windows XP but

171
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,950
it when it rolled past the winds
extended support so we had an issue of

172
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,210
Wired News machines we still need
welfare legacy applications in this

173
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:07,810
particular instance we had an Internet
Explorer vulnerability come out that we

174
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:13,700
wanted to remediate and Microsoft emmett
was the solution for that a lot of these

175
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,020
articles are coming out with there's new
Internet Explorer vulnerability in at

176
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:25,470
the last sentence of that article is is
a mitigates this vulnerability and it's

177
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,720
well documented

178
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,080
you know you got trusts a good day
Kennedy is very much

179
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,900
corner of the tool has written a lot
about your curls Perez another pretty

180
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,390
big name that is worried about the tool
Sansas written about it Microsoft

181
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:45,520
TechNet so it's it's it's out there you
can deploy 200 organization and then you

182
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,590
can grab it with Group Policy to manage
it you get some very basic control group

183
00:14:51,590 --> 00:15:00,100
policy which can do from there so that
you can fully test and export an XML

184
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,630
file that can then be used during log on
as a logon script that they can then we

185
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,970
can grab control then we'll explain why
you want to do that here in a minute but

186
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,440
this is the interface is very very
simple basically whatever it does it

187
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,790
take some of the normal process is in
the machine kind of hide them a little

188
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,290
bit sore in a malicious attackers of
some kind comes in

189
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:30,529
it will find it comes in trying to
exploit that a little block it and

190
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:36,570
usually which again is that when a block
occurs the program in the bottom right

191
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,779
corner probable occurs in this program
was blocked due to this kind of defense

192
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:48,910
and this is the other screen so you have
a very basic setup they also do popular

193
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:54,250
software recommended software Adobe and
Java are two on the basic suggest

194
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,470
putting those in place is going to
really help strengthen your endpoint

195
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:07,069
security and you can go in here and
uncheck so something like a year a DAF +

196
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:14,310
pops up you can check that for the
program and get back working so I tested

197
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,680
this on my dream machines and i actually
pushed out four points in my

198
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,680
organization just fine no problem
whatsoever

199
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,089
tried to push up 5.1 and I had issues I
tested on my three machines of course

200
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:32,639
work fine so I decided to test it on
just the atty floor and I dared the

201
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:40,060
mainframe developer machines during
their Microsoft Office and Internet

202
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:46,410
Explorer so I was running around that
morning on checking year plus for them

203
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,050
so it is very important that you test
this out and even on Mike Simons tool

204
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,980
they have they have some programs there
that it isn't working with to make sure

205
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,779
you but there's i've seen you know like
I said microsoft office whatever reason

206
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:06,870
was done by a minute so it's it's got a
unique environment so make sure you test

207
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,709
that their league in this scenario you
wanna try to grab my computer from each

208
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,909
department and make sure putting it on
there and see if there's any issues and

209
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,790
then pushed it out

210
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,430
so finally the last one is is patch
management as Sherlock people struggled

211
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,640
with it there are very expensive tools
out there to help with this I think I

212
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,590
found a solution that was relatively
inexpensive PDQ deploy has a free

213
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,090
version and all these tools by the way
you can go home today gone up in your

214
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,910
room and downloaded start playing with
PDQ deploy has a free version it is

215
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:49,230
throttled you can't download certain
packages but it's only 500 bucks for the

216
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,390
Enterprise version and you can
essentially go in there and this is the

217
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,690
downloads going right there it even has
a limit on their redeploy

218
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:05,440
Adobe's on there there's just a whole
host of programs that are already in

219
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,140
there so they have programs that you can
download prepay pre-packaged and set up

220
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,750
for you to deploy silently I've pushed
to be flashed on ability or Adobe Flash

221
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,090
updates throughout the day during
business hours and never had an issue so

222
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:29,700
pretty much agreed to all so when she
had to txt download it you can deployed

223
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,650
Active Directory PDQ inventory
Spiceworks and you know a good old text

224
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:45,000
file so it wasn't all that PDQ in toy is
Russell's inventory and they they lost

225
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,330
$500 but it does go out and find out
what's installed on their what versions

226
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,850
on there so all you do is approved
package and put it out so here are some

227
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,250
more resources I will make these the
slide deck available on my website

228
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,370
Timothy D blog.com and there's just a
bunch of stuff out there was talk about

229
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,690
Google talked about just using the user
guide for all these tools you to convert

230
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:16,900
is like this have a lot of great stuff
on there and hear all the tools again

231
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,110
posterity and that's pretty much it has
any questions
