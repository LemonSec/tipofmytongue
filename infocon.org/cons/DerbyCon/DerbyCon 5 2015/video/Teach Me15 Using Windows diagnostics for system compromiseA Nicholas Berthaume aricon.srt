1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,559
so I'm here to talk about using with me
as I got explores isn't optimized you're

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:19,369
looking for the Jeep thing its next door
I think it started so I'm Nick was going

3
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:27,890
on with our lives on IRC dropping more
than self occur anywhere a lot like

4
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,500
playing games and I really like easy
because you know everybody likes easy

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:40,820
there is going to be some delicate
language in this if you're worried that

6
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:51,110
I'm sorry so what is it about is anyone
here familiar with windows

7
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:57,380
troubleshooting no never had to fix a
windows box

8
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:10,210
reboot yeah so what I am doing is using
troubleshoot to tools to bypass things

9
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,220
like antivirus new phishing attacks show
your toolkit on how to do it

10
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:23,660
delegation also because as trouble
building macros that actually work would

11
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,020
fail that people bring for it

12
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:34,560
know it's it's difficult to tell tale
and what have you and it's it's like a

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,950
lot of hoops so I saw this being a great
avenue for replacing that or at least

14
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:48,040
augmenting it with something you don't
require this office so why should you

15
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,479
want something that can get by some
systems because a lot of stuff will

16
00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:07,970
block you know macros GPO or some other
security system so this is why not just

17
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,390
his portion for getting a shell not just
football but also for doing this

18
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:25,080
exploitation recon on networks and easy
to write like our shelter accenture is

19
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:33,830
fair number of your view and if you're
as I said if you're here

20
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:42,030
so if not it's going to be really cold
so he's one of my coworkers by the way

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:49,150
so so this is a new technique I don't
know anybody else to talk about this or

22
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:57,130
I did log but I've all but a little bit
and I wanna presented here so I'm gonna

23
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:04,370
be releasing this week that will allow
us to be great on many systems so you

24
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,190
know how to use some of my go over some
of those because there are some reasons

25
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:23,940
aren't quite there yet and new found
love for troubleshooting it will not be

26
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,030
there are some problems with it like
with every take me there are some issues

27
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:35,209
that you're not into and they're not
always something that was mark you do

28
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,750
have to do some steps given the title
you have a certain code signing key for

29
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:48,760
instance but there's or $60 and few
pieces and child so that their nose your

30
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,820
days in this anime review mice code
signing keys nor will I give you stuff

31
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,920
that I have signed my name

32
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,100
alright so the curse of the Arts VBA
macros this may not be the current state

33
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,040
of the art just don't realize it but
that's what people often use for

34
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,890
embedding code or dropping a zip file or
something of that nature for getting a

35
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:21,209
shelf so encrypted file by destination
is what this can do this woman releases

36
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,500
get a quicker built into it is your
reaction to getting together in action

37
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,460
is detonation systems are terrible
interacting with things like a person

38
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,440
would so very easy to get caught passes
systems even if they are

39
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,230
looking for the file format that i'm
gonna go over the new code caving to

40
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,050
barrels a lot of times the code caving
stuff if you'd like

41
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:52,710
existing deal up from her or something
like that and get caught and does get

42
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,380
caught by lobbying you know you can also
use your days but you know there's a

43
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,330
really expensive and they get killed
pretty quick as soon as they get

44
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:08,760
widespread use and you get things were
assigned outlet and click five times in

45
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,080
Java to get to work but you know what
you'd like to click stuff like to click

46
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,830
things and go across much of menus as
often happens but you know it's it's a

47
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,300
lot of pain for him smile and make it
easy and you something it's already

48
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:39,660
built into the new job so they are
really over till so diagnostic Abbott's

49
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,790
Humira heard that before

50
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:54,280
usually people have shown the doctor
before so it was designed to facilitate

51
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,650
creation of diagnostic tools or
originally from Microsoft

52
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,640
later it was introduced into the
operating systems everyone could use

53
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,660
them so if you've ever done Microsoft
support they will see new exe

54
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,410
extracted actually install or use the
tool on the operating system and then

55
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,960
call one of these diagnostic test those
would come in like and then upload the

56
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,320
data back to my passion for you know
troubleshoot

57
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,250
that started I believe you got it in
Windows XP and got for the final

58
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,730
invested 2007 they added it as a primary
components and they no longer needed

59
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,570
eighty special like an expedition to
execute will enable each so it really

60
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,410
nice thing about these though is they
run made a powershell so R celebrates

61
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,580
the weapon of choice for everybody

62
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:55,230
until people actually figure out how to
turn it off it's easy to great if you

63
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,420
haven't heard saying keep were you able
to add one to the storm system and it's

64
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,180
commonly used mostly by Microsoft and
hardware vendors to fix problems with

65
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,560
their hardware well go through this is
how you create them and these are some

66
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,320
wonderful techniques you can use along
with them to do additional tasks you can

67
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,860
embed a lot of scripts so you can take
an existing vendor just like everyone

68
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,390
have like every Android he paid a text
uploaded to a third party in fact

69
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,230
ordinary solve all the other stuff
somewhere thing is just as essentially a

70
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:36,680
zip file with a coat which has instead
of job or something else is going to

71
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,270
have your PowerShell scripts as well as
deal else and other stuff so you can

72
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,930
actually use existing functionality back
door and then gesture code whatever you

73
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:55,200
need to its any shipping so say you got
exchange for you has a set of PowerShell

74
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,980
scripts mammals very important in there
for manipulating she answer or office or

75
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,980
any other Microsoft walk through a third
party software that has that it's able

76
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,140
to make use of those on that system so
you interact with on reconfigure it

77
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,480
wanted to you know get some additional
info you can drop these things on and

78
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,650
call those things needed

79
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,229
and it will love soon to rate them or
you don't check to see if successful

80
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:28,720
information then other things may be run
directly by clicking which is nice what

81
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,529
to click right and then the other way
that you can do it is by calling from

82
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:43,349
the command line switches in the path
micro systems and supplied with a XML

83
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:51,120
file which tells me what to do so
there's no user interaction you do need

84
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,130
powerful 2001 RMC that shifts available
for other operating systems but by

85
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:04,980
default in 2007 and 2008 R two plots it
works on Windows artsy so ever see if

86
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,330
Windows RT which probably never will

87
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:15,529
it will run on that just fine so there's
no need for native code let's do it so

88
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:21,450
it works on ARM platform and I guess it
would also work on the Raspberry hi bill

89
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:29,600
out there right now it should work there
is law yeah clicking Next there's no

90
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,800
auto execute mimetype so I'm like a job
with the change in all P or somethin

91
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,790
somethin would actually from the browser
it doesn't have that functionality lets

92
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:50,400
you going at it and it requires OCSP
access in some situation talk to you

93
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,650
later wrote this because it's actually
worked at all the bits about it but it

94
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:00,450
hit the order of the pile is more likely
it's gonna work because it's already

95
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:10,390
been checks for whatever reason and then
enabling a timestamp circle

96
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,279
you need something to generate the XML

97
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,709
to create these are manifested
co-signing manifest christopher the

98
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:24,220
secretary catalog Monaco signature apply
to add courses at my code signing nice

99
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,079
part of Windows seven SEK which is a
pain in the butt to install but we

100
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:33,350
figured out they actually released a
diet cap to fix the installer to make

101
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:47,189
sure you can use this is funny saying
t-shirts and I've got this done so this

102
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:52,670
is coming up this week this is actually
irritating but yeah you'll have it

103
00:10:52,670 --> 00:11:02,079
available again tomorrow right so but
something is $60 from us start a cell

104
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,769
you can use another project so you got
some Joba is always in the keystore what

105
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:13,999
you doing other things like she used to
be that he would have signed coach

106
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:19,779
executables but you know I think that
only works on a few subset of vendors

107
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:25,189
now so it's kind of a useful for other
things also you can say my name on this

108
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:32,230
thing can screw with and help stop
unauthorized people from taking your

109
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,220
payload and then reusing it and changing
internals of unless you supplied them

110
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,480
with the ability to interact within way
like while he calls or when I get to the

111
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,449
democrats actually passes

112
00:11:46,449 --> 00:12:03,709
strengths so make the point that you're
our show you know delicate execution

113
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:09,809
intercepts it the only thing I heard
before I even talked about this in any

114
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:13,290
kind of affection know if he was a Palo
Alto system

115
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,829
some other stuff is added some sport
court but I've never seen them actually

116
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:22,759
pick it up if you use custom coding and
whatnot and has something that has user

117
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,470
interaction which twice a detonating
really helpful for this sort of thing

118
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:39,829
anything that requires input before so
we'll see this going to use a very basic

119
00:12:39,829 --> 00:13:05,459
shelter in Jack from PowerShell

120
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:16,449
so this is the winters so what's up what
does it look like every other windows I

121
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:22,410
got sick troubleshoot you might actually
be seen as more yeah so what does that

122
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:30,790
look like bill toomey operating system

123
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:41,050
range why would Microsoft diagnostic
tools so this is a very basic hard coded

124
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:48,980
IP churn and it basically Wilson
michelle kessler it signed by me so you

125
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:55,850
do things like that the privacy
statement to Google yeah it's it's

126
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:15,310
really private so go to some very basic
its detecting our problems he's

127
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:39,360
network stuff went down it up so let's
try again

128
00:14:39,360 --> 00:15:17,940
shall see that what's that ok so without
any issues so long is the code signing

129
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:26,610
stuff gets caught up with the really
easy I'm not so please keep that in mind

130
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:34,360
that I love you always on her things any
kind of our show what this was is just

131
00:15:34,360 --> 00:16:04,690
very basic one caught by any insulin
nice lines so simple as the UIL you

132
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,390
interact with as a troubleshooting and I
will show you how to create one of these

133
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:16,120
by literally copying pasting code
tracking tool file saving and then just

134
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,390
having run

135
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,570
assert its easier than

136
00:16:21,570 --> 00:17:10,940
so the interface busily it is 'cause so
the troubleshooting application all you

137
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,190
have to do is this guy is take your coat
and drop in any given a couple of root

138
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,070
causes here got a global troubleshooter
which will do fun things will get that

139
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:24,339
and then it was a tractions has resolver
which will be another script would run

140
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:29,080
so what you have to do is to a
troubleshooting file do some recon see

141
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,620
is this person even stranger is this
person able to do this that and the

142
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,440
other and then what payload you want to
activate as a result or grab and

143
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,230
download for you because if you have it
already running you can download

144
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,610
arbitrary PowerShell or whatever else
and it also running you don't have to

145
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:53,470
have that part of the site back to do it
so that's also this is Microsoft Visual

146
00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:02,440
Studio yes for the Windows seven SEK
what this is actually a stand-alone

147
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,570
troubleshooting troubleshooting designer
you look up top here so I'm sorry I

148
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:18,530
can't see the screen so I get some jobs
in September

149
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:28,670
my good friend here the slides as well
so it's got a resolver a verifier so you

150
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,270
can verify the resolution was done
properly so if you're still didn't work

151
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,180
for yeltsin outlook 30 said output you
can verify that stuff is working as

152
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,070
intended

153
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,770
like you know 5644 you verify got your
shell for you very much like any other

154
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,920
information on together which is
wonderful and then here's where you

155
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,790
would do you scraps going here when his
powerful integrated

156
00:18:53,790 --> 00:19:01,210
whatever is right here so very very
basic stuff you drop in here and all the

157
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:07,640
code that he acquires is right here so
it tells you whether you fix it or not

158
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,050
well blow this is just the very basic
help executives no encoding on there's

159
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,340
this then you take up even if I drop it
in there was just crazy if you do like

160
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:23,890
you don't have to sing with strings this
issue also to be but they don't

161
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:31,670
inspected it what ya its trusted because
it signed I don't get it but anyway you

162
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,640
drop in here and you vote your shell
hood and I think that we did get a show

163
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,520
right onto the next

164
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:54,350
that's the next little little little bit
so it has an option you do see that in

165
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,200
the thing that made by cutting off for
elevation so that's that's a great

166
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,450
little option used like a box lol ok

167
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:12,160
bypasses UAC settings so cannot amend it
will profit potentials and it will not

168
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,130
repopulating and user like some things
we do for it but you know if they have

169
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,760
the Ministry of accountable go in there
but i think is you can use the trouble

170
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,530
shooting script to see whether it and
then attempt to elevate based upon that

171
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:33,130
operation so really useful that yeah and
I've done this without even looking I

172
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:39,690
was like click shirts in a few USA
prompted pop up like just wonderful

173
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:46,070
cause it's been one body misty TWC which
means there are some houses that we used

174
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,590
to use like explore and stop because
they would be calling something you

175
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,270
doing their contacts and elevate some of
those pics and it's the same concept

176
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,550
because it is a Microsoft occasion is
gonna fix stuff that you are not able to

177
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:24,490
do so

178
00:21:24,490 --> 00:22:23,140
good

179
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:39,050
but we'll move on anyway it's gonna
continue to run here and actually there

180
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,110
are ways that it'll get you can actually
have it

181
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:47,810
finish somebody move on to the next step
will be another shell and then if they

182
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:52,170
cancel it will be another shell any
chance of another shell until he

183
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:57,180
finished you like ok I'm done I'm gonna
kill the process no more shelter me but

184
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:17,020
it's wonderful because it like tries to
run something if it didn't think it to a

185
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:27,000
central server so you sure would that be

186
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:43,380
user air

187
00:23:43,380 --> 00:24:17,680
I like to troubleshoot

188
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:55,930
attacks are you doing so so sorry better
stories as I said do it automatically to

189
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,840
pull in hopefully people don't for april
fools

190
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:06,120
rename you know injection go to another
name is that is just really noxious weed

191
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,840
people run stuff partially downloaded
from the Internet

192
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:15,370
whatever so it will do without the need
for any special being an honorary

193
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,970
generation dancers also what our
interview they're they're useful because

194
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,690
if you can ask you to do something you
can ask it to run it without a user

195
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,590
action so if you have an existing shell
on a system you can use to arbitrarily

196
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:38,730
to inject Chilcotin is something else if
you were like syringe is blocked so

197
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:45,010
that's useful and has a trusted code
it's much less like any thought at least

198
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:52,070
at this point but it is crypter what's
up the only way to do it is disabled the

199
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:59,800
actual misdeeds which is a good idea and
it works off of death and UNC path so

200
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,990
you don't have to have a doc appt
listening sitting on your place or have

201
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,380
the answers files in there so you have
been corrected version on the system

202
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,260
call us an answer phone and UNC share
and habits come back and give you

203
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:21,080
options like a decryption nice and you
can have its impact as I said output so

204
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,110
there's a simple there's a registry key
actually I'll doing the persistence

205
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,100
model for this

206
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,360
which will actually have a few flip and
all you need to do is flip it and it

207
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,559
will send all the data back to you he
will not store doing locally display it

208
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,820
so any errors or any post acquisition
output you need is it back to your

209
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:50,539
control sir we've got the point I get
one more time before you can also to

210
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:56,600
have people do stuff like I don't know
give us answers which would be really

211
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:06,750
useful if you want to have somebody pick
10 wherever else so we can pass

212
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:13,890
parameters to do so where is the show
going so the reason this is useful can

213
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,179
anyone guess to put the IP and drop this
on the system

214
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:24,970
you given answers to some place else
that's great I can also do things like I

215
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,320
want to do this particular triplet more
I want to do a full PowerShell

216
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,970
interpreter popped up for me that would
otherwise be blocks she's tried this

217
00:27:34,970 --> 00:28:02,460
hard right

218
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:14,540
so if you have like you don't know what
you're gonna be also one thing that's

219
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:24,450
you sure I'm gonna do things like at
things to it like enabling tera toh and

220
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:34,740
making it the fault so you can tell alot
of something that would turn us against

221
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:41,690
Toronto is Microsoft Microsoft ODBC
adapters and fortunately microsoft also

222
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:47,010
supplies this wonderful service for all
Windows systems ever equipped with

223
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:53,240
peridot who sit on their system to do
call backs to them the tunnel ipv6 over

224
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,280
ipv4 so you if you enable you can have
shell listener sitting on terror and

225
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,230
over have a duty call back to Microsoft
from Microsoft's cloud and people are

226
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,080
going to trust Microsoft cloud it's
extremely easy anyway with our show

227
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:19,720
that's one of the few things that I like
and so what if it weren't so it's magic

228
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,710
USA bypass does not you a whole use
existing functionality heroism indicate

229
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,290
this but honestly it's built into the
system is integrated obviously with all

230
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:35,150
the operating system and in order to get
that out or disable it really do have a

231
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,930
hard time seen literally more than you
can with any of the existing courting

232
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:46,160
process i've seen out there it does not
disable this function oh yeah disabled

233
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,160
this I found out you it's not there
don't want to say well you still get

234
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:58,690
shell where's all user data in the
user's voters whatever block this

235
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,090
extension that's probably the best way
because only a few select people out of

236
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,159
the Microsoft Excel use this right now

237
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:10,710
hardware providers so if you see he's
coming down your property laws for an

238
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:17,440
email would probably be better idea just
to block it entirely like you would any

239
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,489
sexy or something else and and learning
and aren't some buy microsoft this is

240
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,229
actually pretty easy to do

241
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:31,479
relatives who disabling PowerShell and
because the small number of institutions

242
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:37,070
that actually use these that are not
local administrators which I've seen one

243
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,210
instance where people have to do all
these cells they are they're not gonna

244
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:49,299
be simon rex also you can do that
eliminated it off the signing sir so as

245
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:54,859
soon as I said there are some problems
if you sign it recently and you get time

246
00:30:54,859 --> 00:31:01,359
stamping service sometimes the system
will not work for a couple of days for

247
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,769
whatever reason because it hasn't
verified something it's I'm trying to

248
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:09,769
figure out who did this but that's the
next thing so this will be more

249
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:15,009
effective is actually had somebody told
me that they tried to engagement and it

250
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:24,159
didn't work because that system wasn't
able to call back to the CSP server and

251
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,830
then scheck were the validity of the
search so time stamping services should

252
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:34,419
help with this but it doesn't always
right and I said including things like

253
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:35,609
an arrow

254
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:47,789
do and using that for all the changes
the operation so its references and for

255
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:52,470
all the great things like hey this is
everything you'll need to deal with do

256
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,769
indeed examples they did here and as I
said that actually download all the

257
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:03,009
resources so and actually I would love a
cool name for it or because they lack of

258
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:08,809
me figure something so when one has a
suggestion

259
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:23,460
think people know haha anybody hear from
other hackers that kinda back away

260
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:31,070
nobody's there are still in the Ville
project for having to do any actual code

261
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,809
eat supper if you think that generates
XML manifest sign stuff Microsoft make

262
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:56,700
it easy my kiddos and great great
conference contact me and I dot dot

263
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:38,690
dying here so I got sorry for the video
so you can actually reply icon but you

264
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,730
know what I call his house in his house
in a DLL see you can actually use that

265
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:48,100
for reflective injection is actually
running the code that's in the DLL

266
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:53,220
when the system is when the things
started so we don't have to click the

267
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:58,029
Next button

268
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:11,899
yes just like all the other things the
answer file can the script that actually

269
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:15,909
has generated for you but also you get
any answer if you have a printer saying

270
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:20,409
he wanted to an elevator or not at one
time you can actually strip that out so

271
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:49,179
with just applying at the XML there is
actually something needs to be fixed

272
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:55,559
before I hit a publicly you may be able
to get your own and figured out as a

273
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:00,230
sling all that hard to find but I'm not
going to give you specifics about some

274
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,710
more because it is an ability
