1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,710
let me know when we're ready to start we
recorded so my name is Karl Alexander

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:13,500
and go by dr. hacks on Twitter Follow Me
At School if you don't that's cool to

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,980
have been in the industry about thirty
years ninety roughly I work for a

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,189
fortune out what we are today but it's
it's a fairly large global company and

5
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:37,710
we have we have only 89 facilities 1600
+ applications millions of customers so

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,649
it's a pretty pretty good sized network
in environment that we had playing one

7
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:50,340
of the things I've been doing for past
13 years working in InfoSec working

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,239
InfoSec I need to be I mean it's just
absolutely if you're not having fun in

9
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:02,989
InfoSec you're doing it wrong I just
like that things that I like to look

10
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:10,630
back on his first acts well as I went
back into old guys probably I went back

11
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,990
into cable box and put gum wrappers
underneath hot and you could actually

12
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,670
get different channels that you didn't
subscribe to

13
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,240
so let's count on my first thing I ever
did

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,700
now as a kid some of the things we all
know there's two things you can be sure

15
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:38,250
of his death tax everything else is up
to you literally so with that i wanna

16
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,140
talk a little bit about the challenges
that we run into a nympho sac in that

17
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,549
everything is a lot of times we were not
across they're doing here has a

18
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:57,290
frustrating position it you know oh my
goodness lick the hands go I know that

19
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,540
you know so what I want to do with that
is I want to explain the don't laugh I

20
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,060
dare you think ok

21
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,810
in the second istry we get a lot of
pressure if you want to go ahead and

22
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,690
start past now people who want to raise
your still take care of you I don't have

23
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:25,500
that many but some breaches occur on a
daily basis and you can buy a game I can

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,140
tell you you know reaches are stressful

25
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,330
company here with when somebody else has
a breach your management gets involved

26
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,870
if you're in and if you're doing been
testing its my house breach there's

27
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,350
gonna be a spike in your and your
activity so InfoSec has a lot of

28
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,910
pressure has lost read what I would
encourage you to do is figure out how to

29
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,670
have fun with now for those under gettin
the Bourbon already I would I would ask

30
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:04,140
you to step on it and that's like what
you wanna do is wanna feel it burn you

31
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,110
don't want to just go but down because
it's not wise made war upon it in cattle

32
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:18,420
and it can encourage your self and the
best of ways you wanna have fun with I T

33
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,209
and when I say have fun with it it's
really up to you because each of us make

34
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,100
a decision whether to have fun with it
or whether to look at it as a bad thing

35
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm in such a frustrating environment
this is just terrible

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,190
you can look at it that way or you can
look at it on the positive side so you

37
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,180
know I'm gonna make this better I'm
going to keep trying and keep trying and

38
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,829
I'm gonna make it better

39
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:51,920
we're in we're in a tough position so my
role as I like to find humor in what I

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,830
deal with on a regular basis so
everybody's gonna see these

41
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,790
how many of you laugh when you heard
about that Ashley Madison you know it's

42
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:10,410
it's it's it's freakin funny and good
friend told me a little bit more about

43
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,430
this and i was just like I was amazed
what they were actually doing and what

44
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:21,070
their business models but the long and
short of it it's serious business right

45
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,600
they they're they're going to have a
hard time in business now but we gotta

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,950
let OPM might not laugh about that so
much special if you have clarence goes

47
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:41,160
not only did your credentials and other
peoples information that now you as well

48
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,050
so it's it's not all fun and games but I
would submit to you if you look at Dave

49
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:54,360
in this picture does he look like I want
to visit example names in the example of

50
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,760
somebody who always shows having some
fun in this industry and that's reason

51
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:06,800
to become successful my opinion now
about a major accident sorry told you

52
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:16,320
have been within the company had chat
now when I say I had to shut down 120

53
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:25,700
facilities lot people beyond yeah the
situation was just had to protect the

54
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,660
rest of the enterprise we had to
management stressed out they were

55
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:38,880
absolutely just checking read how long
it is just stare all the people who are

56
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,050
responsible for making this problem go
away they were stressed they came up to

57
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,800
me and they asked me a question

58
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:54,729
they said don't you have any good news
about 50 together and I said I just save

59
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:04,199
15% on my car and that's exactly what
they did they let you broke that ice to

60
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,050
get us through the stress to help us
push forward and we can make good

61
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:15,240
business and that's what it's about
making good business decisions in spite

62
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,680
of the situation that you're working I
love to share this slide you may not be

63
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,080
able to see it here you'll see it but
it's one of those stories where you know

64
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,280
it's easy to laugh at somebody who's
doing something wrong in this in this

65
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,469
video but you can read it basically they
do here he's like you know when I was a

66
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:40,110
kid

67
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:53,110
spend $1 candid anymore to me damn
security cameras that was exactly what I

68
00:06:53,110 --> 00:07:00,690
look for the you so be careful you know
don't don't put too much you know what I

69
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,050
mean is you need to know

70
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,479
has its place and when it does and you
have to be familiar network in order to

71
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,460
do that so you don't want to do it in
her own situation because it can then

72
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:21,479
escalate onion when we say I love this
one of y'all seeing this from my seen

73
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,199
this before

74
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,229
yeah there you go good job

75
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:35,659
trusted say anything about this real now
but it's hilarious

76
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:40,690
this is this is the point I'm trying to
get across people who are leaders in the

77
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,419
industry

78
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,449
understand humor in what we do

79
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:50,689
is a Horton saw skill that we don't
teach near enough and it's great that

80
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,189
you have technical skills it's great
that you can tell what bit went where

81
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:02,039
when or why but it's more important
literally to be able to do that and easy

82
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:09,749
fashion doesn't make somebody else feel
like they're not work then it's better

83
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:16,620
to share it with humor and don't laugh
at them laugh with and that's kinda like

84
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,939
this is it's a pond on the then be
careful with that

85
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:32,079
get just remember we're all in this
together so have some fun with some

86
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:41,959
benefits to did you guys know that it
actually decreases it decreases pain you

87
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:46,339
know I wake up every morning now I'm a
little older hardest thing for me to get

88
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:56,510
out but it is tough but I'll ask when I
walk into the office and you know it's

89
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:02,949
rough day humor helps me get through it
decreases that I and physically and

90
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:10,610
mentally how many times have you been
stressed out you're doing something as

91
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,889
stress that a presentation got a pin
tested gotta finish up get right up

92
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,380
gotta finish got something that you
gotta get

93
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:27,570
the fact is if if you keep humor about
it will help to calm those fears it will

94
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,600
help to calm that down and those around
you that you work with their be there

95
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,240
are more willing to help you when you
have this so keep that in mind and

96
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,460
that's the social part of the social
part of this if you help diffuse

97
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:52,050
conflict I know environment wherein
thousands of people totally separated

98
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,620
miles and miles apart it becomes very
difficult very difficult to communicate

99
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:06,040
and the fact of the matter is humor if
you can find it will help to help to

100
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,680
eliminate some of the shower so don't
underestimate the power of this job you

101
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:23,060
do every day so far a heart on this a
little bit let's do this we want to make

102
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:30,510
it so on and when I say yeah I mean I T
and general I T operations testing

103
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,590
practice what we normally do as we do
something called burn it to the ground

104
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:41,580
what that means is I don't just get a
box that's not that's not the idea what

105
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,890
we do is we get on the bus

106
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,960
figure out maybe an administrator's
password and then once we get that we

107
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:56,760
sneak through the entire environment as
an administrator in such a way that we

108
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,230
looked legitimate we we try to make it
as real as possible with the type of

109
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:11,500
applications that we're working with you
get to the end of the rope is there's a

110
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,250
golden there's a golden goose back and
we show the business exactly what we're

111
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:23,250
able to do how we were able to do but we
add to that and win

112
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:30,240
and that win his we allowed them to
understand what they can do to fix the

113
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,230
challenge their hands we don't just
leave them with you've got a problem we

114
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,830
leave them with a problem that solvable
in that speaks volumes to people because

115
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:48,200
it's not what's in it for me and showing
that I'm cool its I'm trying to just

116
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,070
like everybody in this room today I'm
trying to help you understand that

117
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,430
building humor and laughter into what
you do on your job will help those

118
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,380
around you those you network with it
will make a difference in your life long

119
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:14,150
term I'm not perfect at it if everybody
tries no community succeeds burning down

120
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,200
the house very important

121
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,390
going to what we call our blue team we
have stock we have a lot of different

122
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,150
groups that take care of our blue team
side within the blue team side we want

123
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:34,620
to make it fun as well so we'll take our
Pinterest watching as we're together and

124
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,690
we want to be able to figure out who's
doing what we're doing that time we want

125
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:48,230
the defenders be able to watch don't
stop necessarily see if you can see and

126
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,880
hear that during that process we find
that we have blinds

127
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,500
know it's great when you know somebody's
trying to get at you but you cannot see

128
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,720
it makes you want to change it it makes
you want to do bad all of us want to do

129
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,520
better that makes life fun doing better
every success it's always bad when you

130
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,190
have a dentist come in and they tell you
that I just don't everything that you

131
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:23,290
have and you saw its ok when you're
trying to the fan and you know that

132
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,410
you're having trouble and you're able to
make the changes and make the

133
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:32,350
adjustments and find the gaps it makes
it a much better experience has taught

134
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,939
one-sided

135
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:41,919
so that's what I say when I say apply it
that's where I'm going to so the purple

136
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,769
team challenge you may not be
environment where he can do that but if

137
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:49,679
you're a pen tester the next time you
write a statement I would encourage you

138
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,269
to say in the statement of work I want
to be able to work with your Blue team

139
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:59,759
and let them know that we're coming let
down now don't be afraid if you're good

140
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:06,229
at the skill matter there's enough
problems out there but what you're gonna

141
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:10,720
do if your gonna make up in tests more
valuable to your customer

142
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,720
anything you could ever match in for the
pen test it's more of a challenge

143
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,389
because they have to get better for the
blue team that's facing it it gives them

144
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:29,129
the opportunity and that's what it's all
about everybody knows we're all in this

145
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:40,389
business together so I might tell you a
little bit about how outside we do a lot

146
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:45,349
of projects in my company and sometimes
we do things that are remote when I say

147
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:50,429
remote I don't want to see all my people
travel around the world I want to keep

148
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:57,619
them nice family atmosphere where
they're not having to get out and all so

149
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:03,619
we try to supplement our internal been
tested with external and part of that

150
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:09,189
part of that leads me and down the roads
where I get these experiences where we

151
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:15,699
as a group we went out to this vendor
and we want to start doing this this

152
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:23,299
service for our customers and the better
came back said sure so they brought me

153
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,520
and we want to make sure these things
before putting out the street

154
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,910
about the public was like all great so
first thing I did was I asked for some

155
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,090
schematics I asked for some
understanding of what the project live

156
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:43,420
long and short of it these guys came
back and I said you know I do some

157
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,880
lockpicking anos lock on this thing just
visual looking ahead the lock on this

158
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,740
thing looks like it's one was really
cheap little laksa to find like on the

159
00:15:51,740 --> 00:16:01,720
TSA yeah it's not hard but it's up the
top and nobody would ever do that made

160
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:09,110
it so they had to go back literally and
retrofit the locks changed because I

161
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,130
said I would do that after work after
that they were like oh lord what a

162
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:20,370
weekend or so I started asking us if you
know how to paint tested and have you

163
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,870
ever had and they they were like they
shook their heads they'd never heard of

164
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,850
it so I said well that's what we're
gonna do underpin tests and whatnot look

165
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,950
at all your systems and make sure that
their functioning the way we would

166
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:43,650
expect within this within walk up with
your driver's license but your driver's

167
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:49,090
license will open up the doors when the
lockers and then you can get a package

168
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,020
at or whatever

169
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:55,660
in this case it actually communicates
with a cellular modem Mac through

170
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:05,520
wireless so it's also contained sounds
pretty solid got encryption with well

171
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,450
what we found out in the dentist was one
you could use some bar codes because it

172
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,410
was a bar code readers on the same and
the pen test was able to use codes and

173
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:23,390
open all the lockers really scary so we
got that fit that took him about one day

174
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:28,920
we then turn around and looked at what
we do from the internet

175
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,330
things you know it's like now

176
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:40,220
we found out that they were using to
fall on the seller within 48 hours they

177
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:48,350
open markers from the internet so the
point when I went back and shared this

178
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,980
with some of the team that was generated
all the stuff in the field they were

179
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,149
they were gasping and I try to keep this
in and happy state for the folks that

180
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:04,070
were dealing with the fact is we've
never had it been test test is this

181
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,649
going to be difficult to move forward
with this so the point I want to make

182
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:15,070
try to have fun with it there's going to
be situations are going to but I find

183
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:23,710
this hilarious as fun to work with this
some of the things i would tell you are

184
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,779
you created now

185
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:33,409
lot of you look at this recognizes this
box 1 Adrian bill little while back you

186
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:37,669
can have fun there's different ways I
made a box the other day has a fire

187
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:43,590
alarm and you open one block and you get
to the second locked behind plexiglass

188
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:51,299
and it put some stress on you but the
whole point is have fun with and you can

189
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,720
do competitions within your group you
want to improve his skills competitions

190
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:04,570
have fun don't just you know don't be
reserved about make some time for I got

191
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:19,549
some TSA lock boxes Nike you know you
can put a couple of these nerf guns in

192
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:25,100
there but one guy here and start doing
on the lockpicking endeavor who gets to

193
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:33,010
the church and then they get some fun
out so we created it doesn't take that

194
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,649
much to do this stuff that's the point I
want to get across to you don't have to

195
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:43,039
be some super genius person to do this
cuz I'm a very calm and very basic

196
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,240
person very

197
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:52,400
average so I don't want you to think
that your ideas are great because you

198
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,600
can have on file with average ideas

199
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:04,690
giving back to the community and a lot
of you you see Adrian as an example of a

200
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,090
tree is one of the best guys I know
about giving back to the community this

201
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,360
is a picture from contesting an opt-in
testing but a course that we're doing

202
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:24,810
and doing some training on Metasploit
and some hack so the and the ideas you

203
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,250
can have fun doing this stuff get out
and be part of the community

204
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:35,270
don't just there's a lot of things going
on in areas around you you have to take

205
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,710
the time to go to the fact is because
you're here today

206
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,100
chances are you stand out in your
environment already because most people

207
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:51,510
don't go to conferences so I just want
self on back for that one giving back to

208
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:58,500
the community now I knew that Adrian
like me and I was over in Wales and ran

209
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,210
across this place I was in a castle they
sold to me so I was like you know I

210
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,010
won't give back to the community to help
you now so I went bottom samina brought

211
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,420
back with me you know it's pretty cool
right you're thinking about others put

212
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,000
others before yourself in some ways
that's the idea of the networking we

213
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,600
talked about earlier we heard the
keynote about the networking so also

214
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:35,500
want to Dublin and I got something while
I was there right now Michael to give me

215
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,860
this bottle appeared on notice it is not
going away very fast on this many people

216
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,700
wanted it

217
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:50,809
but Michael if you wouldn't mind this is
twelve year old twelve-year-olds we are

218
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:58,399
here on out last is that what ya share
seriously share it with others

219
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:02,110
yeah bring those glasses on up if
anybody wants any of this please come

220
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,279
out and get giving back to the community
that's my whole thing trying to give

221
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:13,590
back and this is a little this is a
little rough him that's fine that's part

222
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:20,269
of we we deal with this is a picture
from where we were down in Nashville

223
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:26,830
International Issa conference in in the
point I want to make with that one is

224
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:34,889
that the ISIS a conference it's usually
about you want to call industry a white

225
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:39,950
shirt with ties and there's pretty type
pretty tight it's not is not happy

226
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,080
community we showed up down there we
were we were doing lock picks we were

227
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,389
doing in a tree and had some raspberry
PI's we're done a lot of things like

228
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:54,919
what you see right here Derby Conn and
they ended up we're building can't

229
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,980
anna's and and and the fact is everybody
likes to do some hands-on everybody

230
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,980
likes that so don't be afraid to get
involved with community if you're not

231
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,549
it's your duty and want to do this right
now it's your duty to give them back

232
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:17,500
because if you don't get back its gonna
be harder on you because you're not

233
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,000
going network is much I've got more out
of networking in the community that I

234
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,110
have anything else I've ever done no
school in networking in the community

235
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:36,590
and I know everybody's like you don't be
iced truth is I don't but I like to give

236
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,360
back to the community through through
hackers for charity if you're not

237
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,970
familiar with them please take the time
to get get involved with that they're

238
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,950
doing wonderful service we all take the
internet for granted

239
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,909
and in fact is Johnny's down there
trying to make the world a different

240
00:23:54,909 --> 00:24:00,950
place with his knowledge not to make
himself money but to be able to give

241
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:06,370
back to the community and our support of
him doing that is part of us helping do

242
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:13,600
that as well so with that being said I
want to thank you guys for coming in and

243
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,919
listening to the talk today the URL here
talks a bit more about humor you how I

244
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,380
can actually help you physically
mentally and socially and for those who

245
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:38,419
now have a red cup the proper way to do
this just let it float around your mouth

246
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:44,139
feel that little bit of burn in the back
of your throat and the longer that burn

247
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:51,139
exists what happens is you know the
better the better the burden the longer

248
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:57,389
that Bernal Journal last sometimes and
you can do this for hours and never get

249
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:01,260
drunk because if you do it properly

250
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:07,169
you're going to enjoy it it's moderation
too many times we like to take this and

251
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:14,620
go but now as I've gotten older one I
found is we need to take your time and

252
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,309
you make it make it last

253
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:22,570
it's much better so with that I thank
you all for attending today and I think

254
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,360
the guys on the video crew appreciate it
