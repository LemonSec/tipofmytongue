1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
or an especially the types of the
practices of our trades and so I decided

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,620
to design a framework around your pen
tester told in a way to keep things

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,849
consistent and up-to-date across the
board

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,260
it's a really easy framework like I i
really you're too kind of offer the

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,710
Metasploit Framework so the syntax be
pretty similar to other folks are used

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,210
to it but I also got more of a module
framework around mess well as well so to

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,630
create modules on inside a pediatric
dentistry work is very easy to do it

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,190
takes a little about you know 35 minutes
depending on the complexity at all like

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,000
a friggin week to figure out how to get
that to work in in automate that but it

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,010
works now a great way but size released
a way to keep on your toes up the dates

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,860
on the framework to add your own tools
and I know that you know we do our

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,059
pentasa trust that we have our own
custom tools things that we actually

13
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,780
used internally as well so those two are
internal repositories and having both

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,420
stores on me know continues up to date
from the various different folks in

15
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:06,760
nineteen those tools internally come on
me and I slowly five minutes

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:21,900
forms here i mean ass if it gets fine
wine through my presentation or a local

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:38,079
and hot paybacks a bitch talking animals
in the coolest thing ever but let's PDF

18
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,700
is one of the things I really I use all
the time now in the reason I use it

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,320
because I like to use that that's all
that i right in saying I'm going to Penn

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,790
test that can use all at like two more
tools are former tools I remember when I

21
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,500
started like 45 told her not to like 17

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,670
or something like that and a lot of
that's been through contributions to the

23
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,660
community also a little bit about that
but the community has really taken hold

24
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,140
of it to you and summit on request
remember

25
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:12,940
joy release its cool at DEFCON call
empire are the cause of peace eyes when

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,820
they released that so literally within
like 30 minutes of that talk being done

27
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,060
there's already a model for Empire and
with pts are you to do is just one to

28
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,700
twenty automatic that's it you know so
it's your new toys are augmenting their

29
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:39,290
as you gonna do not show you an example
to get you to do is get clone and it's

30
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,060
going to get out and just browse trusted
sec

31
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,880
get repositories all the tools I writer
underneath there and then he just upto

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,690
now going slow connection here that's
pretty quick and then going to PDF all

33
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,570
you need to do is is launched the PTO
executable and with pts every time you

34
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,880
run it it automatically update
everything for you so it updates the

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,980
newest version of PDF program all the
new models and make sure you have all

36
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,450
the latest and greatest repository c/o
never had to do it get cold get whatever

37
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,820
anymore it automatic going to get pull
ups and he gets here

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,880
version has 122 and I you notice here
it's got a similar type of fuel to

39
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,489
Metasploit you have kind of the prompt
and type help or whatever it also does

40
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,570
on smart detection operating system so
if you're running Debian for example in

41
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,799
those to use Debian packages believe
supports a number of respect BSD W in

42
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,970
Calera sport redhead now hold for
another one has cameras harder members

43
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:54,030
on documentation is also supported on 64
bit platforms I'm so there's two

44
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,660
different types of tile sets one that
runs better 64 bit on the proposed down

45
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,300
but basically it has a way of keeping
honor tools a central location to

46
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,490
present you know so little about your
account is 68 inner-city see models show

47
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:16,650
models very similar to you because here
it has all of the tools and that's what

48
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,299
impact does the screen resolution

49
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:24,170
you can see here that all the tools in
their associates ok this boy you know

50
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,420
JBoss our own brood acts like EU force
be exact

51
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,080
morning go all these different times you
have available to you

52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,710
texaco news in in there are broken down
into the pit us on Pinterest doesn't

53
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,660
excuse and it's broken into those type
of Category so like for example you're

54
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,480
doing burnouts a broken down into that
one of things I miss you know growing up

55
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,110
kind of like backtrack and prior to that
like Iraq sanwa pics and all those other

56
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,650
ones is there's always a guy / dentist
directory

57
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,550
you know you're having a really tough
time breaking in and so they start going

58
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,840
to the Hail Marys were you looking to
penetrating the cam never uses to poor

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,730
maybe this'll work in our adjusted
EBITDA is at the helm areas you're

60
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,600
looking for when you're going into those
assessments but you know a lot I'm not

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,850
familiar the types of tools that are out
there I'm so it tries to put in a

62
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,720
structured like oh hey I'm in my
expectation is a single look at what

63
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,820
tools are in there on the kind of go
through and see what types of tools are

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,450
there I'm go she wasn't using so put
them down those categories and you can

65
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,390
see here and install then in you know
like / pen test / reporting saturated

66
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,009
Rehberg you know / wireless / aircraft
and G

67
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:36,680
you know so kinda goes through a lot of
different ones I just wanna install one

68
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:46,610
module or go to not even say okay
whatever use models expectations and

69
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,669
this one right here you know you notice
your changes that we're specifically and

70
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:58,499
in some they're actually in the module /
expectations / 91 swear in there to show

71
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:04,439
off since you know so you know the
actual model itself the location where

72
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:12,129
pools information from currently the PDF
supports get Sen goals allowed different

73
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,580
ways of just getting access to the most
recent version that's all

74
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,199
and again I maintain a lot of these but
also the community does as well as a

75
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,139
little bit about the models in a little
bit but you can also you know sentence

76
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,199
all types of different consider possible
location and different in automatically

77
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:35,469
know how those but we can also do in the
config file mags out here considering

78
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:41,319
you can actually change the base install
it doesn't actually put under whatever

79
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:48,069
you want to blogs are saved in specific
directory in one thing here is that he

80
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:51,699
tries to keep you up to date with
everything that includes an operating

81
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:56,319
system updates like Debian packages and
get updates and upgrades every disagreed

82
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,360
you know all those different components
are you gonna make you update all your

83
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,149
actual operating system 32 goals on as
long as you keep the auto update on you

84
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:13,529
turn it off and it will just do the
regular told songs but I'm going to show

85
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:19,360
modules if we want to go install
everything you want all the tools we

86
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,589
need his module / install underscore
update all know the first time you run

87
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:26,419
this can take a while cuz there's a lot
of schools out there is a lot of data

88
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:29,580
you need to download to install it on a
Mac installed and configured for you

89
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,599
compile them get all the dependencies on
everything you need for those tools are

90
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,860
on display again is a complex one third
of all of them middle build up the jam

91
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,360
bundles anything else for you

92
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,080
and you have it on their top two day
what's great about that is changed quite

93
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,050
a bit I mean have you seen what's out
there but it means I get polls in in the

94
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,639
bushes happening all the time with
Metasploit and when the big issues that

95
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,979
you had with more of the
platform-specific distributions is that

96
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,689
you know you know you get the best way
to be a week two weeks three weeks four

97
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,210
weeks by week six weeks seven weeks you
know how to date don't have a lot of

98
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,180
those so this actually goes in pools
from the most recent proposal you had a

99
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,330
modest border cetera never gonna keep us
down in the package has been over again

100
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,819
and then install them so that works out
really well for the first time here on

101
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,580
this model session saw on described it
all goes to install those tools for you

102
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,550
automatically and then I'm gonna run
again afterwards it'll just going up

103
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,129
data so that the dates are you manually
update them whenever you want to you

104
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:41,010
just a matter of just having one came in
at Mikes when I got a question to you is

105
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:49,220
awesome so these modules / install
underscore update for all yes I'm gonna

106
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,610
go through and you know basically do all
my updates for a bunch exempt auto

107
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,709
updates on so it's going to get update
after upgrade its been a couple of days

108
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,560
and separate assuming two consecutive
months ago sure that it's going to cycle

109
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,920
through all the tools inside the list
every single module every single tool

110
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,910
that there is out there and it's not
going to prompt you for anything on me

111
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,160
go through that again we get modules
missions like all the time comes I think

112
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,610
we have six last week so it's definitely
I'm building up the assumption that

113
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,589
wants you to go and do not show here in
the second the module development but it

114
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:23,449
goes in cycles rallies and I won't go
through

115
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:29,500
gonna background but pretty effective
way of keeping details of the day now to

116
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,490
create a model

117
00:09:34,490 --> 00:10:00,420
sorry there you go get him going to get
an update module I'm observations here

118
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:08,250
and ordered a module literally all of
them under the model directors of new CD

119
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,500
/ modules will see here all the
difference on older structures for them

120
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,470
out since also if you're looking at
getting a new tool just say it's going

121
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,110
to be a new exploitation tool you know
easiest way to do is go to exploitation

122
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,920
here and take a look at all of the other
models that are in there in a sec add a

123
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,380
new Python file in that directory
autonomy he get added into PDF

124
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,910
run-through install and everything else
just a really great documentation as one

125
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,320
of the few things that always lack on
his brain documentation so I wrote a

126
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,870
pretty good setup how to create your own
models what each flag does you know the

127
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,720
whole description around it's no
different flaxseed you so there's also

128
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,709
get to tourism here

129
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:50,310
morning show you how to take an example
of this he took it and can do is to find

130
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,770
who the author the modulus easy for me
to contact you credit for some time

131
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,310
working on it a little description it's
all so this is going to call this will

132
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,649
change its ok what type you want it to
be so get as unified also SVN repository

133
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:11,760
and go into an SVN checkout an update
repository do get cloning get pool it's

134
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,480
a file it actually going his car or did
you get my text files now and then on

135
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,310
top of that good stuff

136
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,020
repository location is gonna be the
location of where you're going to you

137
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:28,579
and she going down the aisle Debian
packages so you look at this one

138
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:35,000
get the essential Python he expect an
open a so those are going to be you know

139
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,020
module dependencies Kors oceans ok cool
methods I use is called after commands

140
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,300
it went after commands is a lot of times
when you know you install something

141
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,340
requires things to happen afterwards you
know Drusus configured effort you know

142
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,400
make me install or you know on touring
up filing and copying the directory

143
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,260
structure or no bundling rubygems things
like that so we can do you want to do

144
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,070
after commands doing silly you know CD
into the install location that

145
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,480
intellectually CD into this allegation
and ok don't force us to figure you know

146
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,990
make making saw you know so whatever you
want to add to these you know as far as

147
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,210
it'll do after it downloads in actually
going installed it a go and run those

148
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,540
few different features they can do

149
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,210
launchers a good one launcher will be
once it actually creates its own mantras

150
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,420
you can call it whatever application you
want two notches from the Pentastar

151
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:36,080
rectory you want to talk about it he
told him to go in Los me move me it's a

152
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,810
directory using your CD player Council
or what everyone to use you know you can

153
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,030
watch from anywhere you want to rebuild
your whole summer knows a lot of

154
00:12:46,030 --> 00:13:05,920
different commands out there me show you
know here's all of the part after

155
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,440
commands in order to get to work

156
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,120
go and start every single time so it's a
lot of work if she goes through and then

157
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,380
this creates a launchers for counsel on
a bench in the NFL's can so that she

158
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,730
goes to increase those launches reach
one that you have in there now there's a

159
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:31,390
couple of commands here means grabber
equip

160
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:42,790
so a lot of times you're using a Nokia
filed for example you may wanna say bye

161
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,750
Pass update to know and election going
install the follies times already gone

162
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,410
cold at the latest code repository can
reduce birth control and power

163
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,300
themselves in a check to see if the same
and it is he going install an update for

164
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,540
you automatically so does little to that
actually makes you know it sports a lot

165
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,380
of different ways their city six
locations if there's 64 bit file types

166
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,340
of different ones work really kind of
anything you want to use a specified

167
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,530
everyone that's out there but I mean has
a quite quite a bit of on here you know

168
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,150
going to post expectation

169
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:29,080
goes to all the diplomats have me cranky
Ghostbusters John Empire vs each power

170
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,010
supply curbs exploitation framework has
historically unicorn unicorn

171
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,340
exploitation

172
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,630
soldier in there in there are you know
working in everything else in the tested

173
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,710
on their ability to run through all
those those back here on its own song

174
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,070
all these are so is there some jeans
here to you when the tools going and

175
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,540
updating on its updating and packets
lingo

176
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,640
getting all the different ones out there
for you yeah of course you have command

177
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,890
you like helping everything was
different was told that you don't

178
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,020
understand the sentence or whatever but
that's really the concept behind PDF and

179
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,110
what I want to get out of it

180
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,000
way to keep your tools nodular easy to
use a work in progress

181
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,150
you know there are times where I learned
that you know I when I release a model

182
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,710
breaks pts on getting more grand on
fixing those but it's been a funny thing

183
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,670
is when you when you read it I actually
wrote pts like a year and a half ago and

184
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,780
I got like 95% there about instead of
working on projects that sounds like he

185
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,600
talked to a PDF program in 2012 release
that and then released it and then he's

186
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,100
been awesome in kind of adding on to it
has been great but I've been adding a

187
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,500
lot more granularity of not breaking you
know the torso making sure that you're

188
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,670
certain packages and songwriters and you
know the rest of your packages or no

189
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,530
difference I'm trying to get more
platform-specific a lot of them in a

190
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,830
slow difficult for some talks on doctor
in a few things to do and maybe help

191
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,000
hope is that but there's a lot of a lot
of work going into this lot of community

192
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:21,590
support and this is a great friend to
her but many questions just time our

193
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:25,730
oriental return a specific you know like
that isn't you know I can update

194
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,560
function like a kid in a little bit
different because sometimes will happen

195
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,000
is it'll on Ulysse they decide to move
the packages 720 moved to a different

196
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,370
names like in the city's new version 1.0
out of 5 in there was one point six need

197
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,460
put the version number then they removed
the old one did you know that times you

198
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,130
know that that won't be there so does
check this compares undersea whether or

199
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,950
not they're actually legitimate the
updates doesn't your break the

200
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,770
application was not available facility
to continuously update even if that is

201
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:07,459
when asked about specific talk that time

202
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:13,049
the biggest challenge is that while the
standard packaging of like a bunch your

203
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:16,679
Debian so you know they have their own
package names and everything else out

204
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:23,079
there are contemplated creating
distributions for Earth packages or you

205
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,209
know just them specifically be able to
come up with the same thing though most

206
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,990
of the dependencies for most of the
tools out there are two in their

207
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,120
networks it actually works really well
you make it a package mismatch que no

208
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,630
single 83 is called something else
different you know somewhere else but

209
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,250
there are going to be installed which is
a good thing I've had it deployed on

210
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,510
county with or without a problem I run
it all the time and it replaces all of

211
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:50,039
the cali launchers on that are out there
so new poll counsel for example little

212
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,669
over eight cali's Council launcher and
then point you to the most recent

213
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:58,490
version of Cali they have out there so
does work really well kelly also works

214
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,510
you know at the bundy Debbie in laga 132
so entranced a more on the new york

215
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,450
Gnostic of the different platforms you
know somebody does work really well

216
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,929
since I was it thank you very much
