hangover buzz some of this covered the

hello everybody thank you for coming to
Derby Conn my name is Jason Scott I am a

12
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:49,100
happy speaker to become all of the Derby
cons still my favorite conference just

13
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:57,250
people doing what I conferences meant to
do the name of this talk is and by my

14
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:02,850
trail of manuals and it is the
description of a project I involve

15
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,140
myself in about a month and a half ago
where their project when an object

16
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:14,769
lessons that have come that may be of
use to your life but probably a story

17
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:22,220
from a little bit here yesterday was
that I was on a plane coming here and

18
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:31,230
that's when I realized I had left my
laptop on the TSA belt which is the

19
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,030
worst time he noticed that by the way
because not only have I noticed it but I

20
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,230
know that the plane doesn't have wifi
and I know that it's going to be a

21
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,410
couple hours before the plane lands to
sit there and I was reading a book on

22
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,720
the history of bomb-making manuals and
it was hard to concentrate on this book

23
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:01,810
it's called the wrong hands a history of
and I i realized then that I should tell

24
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:09,079
the scene helplessness that drives a lot
of the work and that sense of something

25
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:14,959
that I own something that was my data I
kept on there that that that cold

26
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:22,299
blooded calculation coming into your
inventory of what you have is is what I

27
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:27,980
fight against every single as it turned
out I landed and that's when I

28
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,840
determined that I hadn't done that there
was a happy ending and lakes Lake Club

29
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,850
the the breakfast was the finest
breakfast I'd ever tasted

30
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,370
it was that that sense that my porn was
in the hands of a low paying worker who

31
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,150
knew that this was his big shot and and
and screw that boss of his so it was

32
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:55,920
just a great day to day and and and so i
decided i dress conservatively and just

33
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,570
give people the story that they anyway
so what I do during the day and the

34
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,730
night and the weekends as I work for a
place called the Internet

35
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:14,660
archive.org also known as the Wayback
Machine also now known as arcade and

36
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,820
it's a collection of web pages

37
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:26,190
data software that has been provided to
us and wired by us

38
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:35,580
coming up in twenty years next year it
was founded by billionaire and

39
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,530
of the kind of visionary weirdness he
hired me about four years ago and I have

40
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,600
continued to work there and I adore it
this is a midnight tour that I give the

41
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,770
archive and people like to listen to me
so we dress up in dark clothing and

42
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,120
through our building

43
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,550
with flashlights and the fact that I was
able to close this on a Tuesday and have

44
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:08,130
this happen on a Friday is the kind of
company I really in my life though this

45
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:17,050
caused a reputation which is Jason likes
of which I do I do like old things so

46
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,540
when I start to talk about my life and I
talk about the things here I'm going to

47
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:30,350
be a little different than other
presentations buck words fuck having

48
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,690
words on the screen that you're forced
to read while the person talks to you

49
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:42,570
over here I'm going to have no words
after this except for the information on

50
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:48,530
what this talk was this is all pictures
going on in listen to me look over there

51
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:56,860
but if you're out there and you're
giving a speech please let me let me

52
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,810
tell you the reason people remember my
speeches and come back to them is

53
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,800
because sometimes instead of sitting
down wondering about that I get this

54
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:13,080
exact layout of the spring exactly I
instead said what will people enjoy what

55
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,940
will treat them to something and what
will inspire them to move so remember

56
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,530
that when you're working on your
presentation box words same thing for

57
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:30,990
words when they are in the replacement
of actions when it when you say this is

58
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,650
what should have happened then you are
in the wrong position you you gotta put

59
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,360
your hands back into the Cheetos bag
away from the keyboard and think about

60
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,610
why you telling other people what they
should do

61
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,860
doing it yourself

62
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:53,039
this is about action I love all things
of all kinds of these are old telephone

63
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,379
repair tools at a museum I love all
things that just speak to a certain time

64
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:04,650
for some people they're new to some
people their old it it asks people to

65
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,729
ask questions why are some people in
this room happy what is what what's

66
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,090
going on here I was very disappointed
because the new versions of this that

67
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,060
you click in the peace and I'm like if
you're if you're still doesn't have the

68
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:28,129
red Weldon damage that's that's that's
the red will of discovery this is a

69
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:35,189
prototype of the media lit up into its
components out wire wrapped in it was

70
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:41,009
just sitting on a table at an event so I
went up to it my cuts and each one of

71
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:47,830
those piles of of of warrants end up
being one ship the anger you know one

72
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,909
does just sound one does video and the
fact is by keeping this trying to

73
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:57,190
history around mean you might find
something in there that will innovate

74
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,020
something in the future that the
recognizing these are the parts from

75
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,370
which these are the things that make us
these things that inspired the people

76
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:15,979
that need and so when I call for the
world to send me all of their AOL CDs

77
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:22,960
and this is the beginning of that pile
there was a lot of why would you do that

78
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:32,349
and it was because it was fifty percent
of all manufactured CD roms during the

79
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,719
late nineteen nineties it's a part of
our history it's a part of what makes us

80
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,760
us and there were so many variations
because people got so sick

81
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,820
that there's incredible artwork within
the LCDs so I been collecting hundreds

82
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:55,030
and hundreds of LCDs do I like lol oh
shit but I wanted that history more than

83
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:02,040
I needed to have a personal opinion
conversely the idea of a manual in one

84
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,880
world Emanuel is not particularly
interesting if you don't have the thing

85
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,240
that the thing is a man who will have
the thing and you read the manual the

86
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,270
manuals the most important thing in the
world but if you don't have that manual

87
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:21,810
do not just missing out on the
instructions on how something was built

88
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,940
you're missing out on an entire culture
of how-to manuals made the methods by

89
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,870
which that manual was manufactured the
writing style

90
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,780
the graphic style you know there's lots
of other cultural information and men I

91
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,420
recognize this and we've had hundreds of
our key Emanuel's under manuals mixer

92
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,320
manuals manual that came and told you
about how to use this particular printer

93
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,900
this particular gun and it is again and
so I liked men may I didn't go to sleep

94
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,990
with one but I didn't like you know none
of the Polonia that stuff so I got this

95
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:09,490
call will place that was called manuals
plus an annual surpluses located in

96
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:16,580
Maryland and I lived in New York and
manuals + said people told us to talk to

97
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,670
you because we're going to go out of
business this year and we have all these

98
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,980
manuals and maybe you can help us find a
home for some of them and I said that

99
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,260
would be very interesting how many
manuals and she's like hundreds of

100
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:41,230
thousands I did not run I did not cower
I said ok because many times people

101
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:48,400
contact me and say you know these
manuals piles of this it's huge

102
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,630
my goal okay how big is it how many car
loads it fit in and it'll be one Carlo

103
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:00,080
but then it was huge I took the liberty
of 3,000 floppy disks but it was only

104
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,220
know one carload not devastating and
sometimes people numbers are we

105
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,450
200,000 sounded pretty high I thought
this person

106
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:22,610
little bit facetious but ok so so she
can get back to me for months and that's

107
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,240
fine people get back to me you know
whenever they're either out of business

108
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,470
or whatever but then she called me in
June said it's coming soon and it's been

109
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:38,700
six months like ok he could see you
again still 200,000 and 300,000 ok

110
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:47,160
manuals could be both manuals can be
small the people need manuals and it

111
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,560
turned out that this was a building full
of manuals

112
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:59,150
she called me on a Wednesday and said
yeah he's throwing everything out next

113
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:07,050
week I was like ok thank you for the
warning back and she put me on the phone

114
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,380
with him and i got a sense right then
and there I needed to go down there

115
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,000
because when I said to him I could see
about moving some of these manuals to a

116
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,950
safe location and figure out what to do
next

117
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:26,050
the skepticism in his voice to be used
as a spare tire it was really

118
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:33,390
unbelievably strong and I got a sense
for him this guy appreciated action so

119
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:41,320
that Friday I drove down to manual + in
their Finksburg Maryland warehouse to

120
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,860
speak to Nick because I knew showing up
with 99% of the battle here and I walked

121
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,120
in and this is what I saw so it turns
out she wasn't lying

122
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:03,440
not long at all actually a lot of
manuals in this room I appreciate that

123
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:14,100
and again this was a Friday and said you
know ok all right after double yes yes

124
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:25,300
double a lot of the only like twenty or
thirty thousand ok and the things I've

125
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:33,320
learned to be not to be a barrier is he
ok you work it out later ok I understand

126
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,020
nothings bothering me here as a person
likes hats I want them to have stores he

127
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:47,310
said how much is this hat and they'll
say $600 and I can get inside

128
00:13:47,310 --> 00:14:02,650
doesn't so being able to keep that part
of my voice that was like

129
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:08,040
was extremely helpful and so I'm walking
through these with Nick and tell me oh

130
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,970
yeah you know this was acquired from
another company had boarded about five

131
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:19,720
years earlier they sold many copies site
had figured the business background for

132
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,130
certain number of electronic scanning
and other things killed it so he kind of

133
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,710
kept going but the numbers have been
going down in then finally they were

134
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:34,870
moving to a new building expensive on
this building and other businesses and

135
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,420
so he was like to spend the money to do
the environmental controls just not

136
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:50,529
worth it so yeah we're getting out of
this and I was like ok and I was like ok

137
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:57,780
so Friday we should probably get a
pretty good good amount of these out of

138
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,130
the door in a week and he was like yeah
but we're gonna throw everything out

139
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:13,939
again notice inside voice outside voice
a lot people don't think I have a butt

140
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:17,529
it is and here's the thing this is the
part that shocking right is that the

141
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:23,309
incident was actually the scared will
creep he's afraid of taking risks and

142
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:29,649
choices like that little fucker but it's
in there we all happen it's that little

143
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:32,809
bit of fear of jumping into the void
wondering if there's anything to land on

144
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:39,669
and try to sue me were killed me and and
you don't know why I said ok Wednesday

145
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:46,499
so immediately I got on the horn with a
friend who has a little bit of extra

146
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:52,089
money and I said he's just send one
hundred and twenty-five banker boxes to

147
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:59,269
this location there waiting I knew I had
to do that there was no chance and so

148
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:05,759
that's what happened he called up you
line and 125 bigger boxes had been

149
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,269
shipped for Monday and ok good I drove
home that night having driven in this

150
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:15,399
that warnings that was that was a couple
hundred miles each way and I wrote this

151
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,339
blog entry at two in the morning

152
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:26,529
say in real time help me save these man
I need your assistance I need your

153
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:32,729
friendship I need money you can't make
it please consider coming to this

154
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:39,929
warehouse on Monday helped me rescue and
and that's the jumping into the boys

155
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:50,369
just one schmuck I was dressed better
than I was and so people saw what I saw

156
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:57,209
which is that these manuals are
beautiful they have a meaning beyond

157
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:01,249
being thrown out the the fact that they
were being thrown out was not a

158
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:05,339
testimony to their value to it was
purely a testimony to a business plan

159
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,309
which was fair was making the choice and
he was saying to me I'll give you

160
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:16,990
everything you carry out of my business
which is an incredible amount of faith

161
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,429
and I said I hope to have an army of
people here we will work on it and I

162
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:26,439
wrote him static messages and I got
thousands of dollars in the mill or the

163
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:33,450
people and i ended up having the money
to make choices and I had people say

164
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,530
where do I gotta go where do I gotta go

165
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:43,030
people show up in droves and the first
ones were there when I got there at 8:30

166
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,110
in the morning and they started to walk
in and they sat down what we said was

167
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:55,240
look at the manuals try if we can to get
one of each trying not to get too many

168
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:02,080
of the same you're gonna screw up each
started to be delivered from people and

169
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
again these are people just walking off
the street

170
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,470
somewhat professional librarians many
many many were just weeks followers of

171
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:16,500
mind friends of mine showing up and end
and we we built a speech around it take

172
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:24,390
a walk around pull in this fortress of
manual solitude and then we're going to

173
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:32,260
put you onto a shelf and you're gonna go
to try to take out every day and you're

174
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,100
gonna screw up we're gonna lose we're
gonna have manuals get stored in the

175
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,720
process we're gonna have organized get
too many of one because that is called

176
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,240
and droopy that is part of the life you
can't do the project because it's not

177
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,620
going to be and you personally are going
to screw up and don't worry about it

178
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,120
every person who came in his speech
every person was empowered with the

179
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,660
sense that they were doing the best job
they could that they were better than a

180
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,530
war they were going to make things
better

181
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:11,240
turned out to be one of the hardest
thing to do because they had to be

182
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:19,370
assemble so they were assembling these
banker boxes for us to put in and we

183
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,210
quickly realized that we had not bought
enough banker boxes

184
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:29,870
we had really really really thought we
were we were we were shooting ourselves

185
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:35,750
we were running up Mount Everest with a
q-tip and the theme song to cheers that

186
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:42,250
was the entire way we had prepared so I
called you line imbued with the

187
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:52,559
thousands of dollars people hi it's 11
a.m. how soon today can I get 1500 more

188
00:19:52,559 --> 00:20:00,380
banker boxes so it turns out that
through phone calls and through talking

189
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,440
to their credit department and through
the generous work I'm just gonna go

190
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,419
right back to Ephraim just because he's
around this effort used his credit card

191
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,899
to make the payment

192
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:22,360
it turns out that's three hours and four
thousand dollars of which $500 is the

193
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,050
fuck you plan better next time

194
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:38,070
so so three hours later we got you know
well people are sitting here putting up

195
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:45,440
boxes in the back we got piles and piles
of pallets of boxes and luckily since

196
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,220
this place used to be a warehouse were
able to put in all of these boxes in to

197
00:20:51,220 --> 00:21:00,410
drop them down have people working on
them and so we end up with 1,600 banker

198
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:08,320
boxes which is a lot and it is a
volunteer's walking in I think that kid

199
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,380
on the left is actually younger than all
of the manuals and and the youngest

200
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:22,450
person to help this was not the way so
my memories so he you know there were

201
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:28,370
people who came in with families and we
showed up it hit read it and hit

202
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:36,700
Slashdot and what and yes like ancient
gods rising from the tar of madness

203
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:45,930
people showed up and was like wow you
still read Slashdot

204
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:55,050
and oh my god you got and and and and
here they were so showed up and we

205
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,970
started to pack up boxes we start to
pack up a lot of boxes we packed up

206
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:05,330
boxes to we couldn't see street we ended
up with piles and piles of boxes boxes

207
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:13,730
beyond all imagination over the course
of two days seventy people showed up one

208
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,010
guy showed up

209
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:20,890
got a lift from somebody and he had no
plan on how to get home he got a one way

210
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,450
ride and somebody didn't even know where
this was and went there

211
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:35,650
hotel and what we did was we had
everything was improvised right when

212
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,530
your plan starts on a Friday in your
working on Monday all plans are

213
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:46,540
improvised so first problem was the
market somebody is going to a shelter so

214
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:54,470
we started to put painter tape over one
shelf of a unit that unit is done and we

215
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,990
packed up boxes that things were heavier
and lighter we ended up having to people

216
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:06,880
whose job was to actually open up a box
go through the box and then find things

217
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,230
that could be repacked stronger and
thicker into other books so that they

218
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:21,320
were not lost boxes with one is
protected and being done so people

219
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,340
invented job on the fly

220
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:32,480
given enough agency did they improved
the the the the flabby dole like

221
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:39,070
volunteers that wandered in on Monday
were heartened obsidian by Tuesday the

222
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:45,630
reason we're the apex predator is
because I really really really quickly

223
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,420
first day you kill one of us next day
for killing you

224
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:58,680
ten days later we have a factory of
robots that kill you Kelly days later

225
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,920
writing think pieces about the robots in
the original predator that's now gone

226
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:10,070
that's what we do we adapt quickly and
we ended up like I said width 1600 1700

227
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,390
we ended up reading local state and
Costcos to end up with more now here's

228
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:20,820
an important thing I had been using a
mature leader up to this point to great

229
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,720
benefit people who did not get people
who ordered pizza for and who

230
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,810
were given water and other sustenance to
be able to do their work but these are

231
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:34,660
people who dis volunteering their time
and their reached a point at which were

232
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,980
not needed

233
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:44,910
who had no dog in the fight didn't even
have a dog they just wanted to be and I

234
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,200
thought the worst way to hurt these
people would be to make them now lift

235
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,620
these boxes anywhere and so we didn't
hire rose again with a 24 hour notice

236
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,670
but that's what prozor for its more
expensive that way but we hired these

237
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,190
dudes came in and their job was to load
it up into a truck and go to the free

238
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:14,520
storage units I was able to get one mile
away and they were right because then it

239
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,280
was just a job take all these boxes put
them in a box drive the box to another

240
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,110
box put the boxes in the box which is
how they described it like it's kind of

241
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:29,140
funny to watch a bunch of a bunch of
movers like slowly mentally deal with

242
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,800
the kind of job you wouldn't have gotten
when you were in prison

243
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:40,830
much less in other places and the guy
was like going home box there yeah I'm

244
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,340
going to the little stores their in
boxes until my wife to move my lunch

245
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,130
into some sort of bad i dont wanna
blacks and so i'm just listening to them

246
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:57,360
work on it so I got all their names
their listed and and I just you know and

247
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,640
on the far right on your side with the
hat that was his birthday so I hit him

248
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,850
hard at it because it was just like hi
no warning 1600 bucks and they look at

249
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:16,590
them into storage units that were what
the closest thing I could find again

250
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,840
just like checking on Monday with
storage units are there and we ended up

251
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:27,050
with smiles and piles and piles of boxes
inside a storage unit and you know

252
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:38,680
should be to some extent and the menu
when we were done we had left behind us

253
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:48,370
two shells that were now not fully but
you know the way we think their number

254
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:54,910
she originally said 21,000 people 30,000
manuals and I think it's more like 50

255
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:59,340
75,000 like we just ran the numbers like
just kind of looking at them like this

256
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:08,230
is just 75,000 of stuff that is now in a
storage unit in maryland instead of here

257
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:17,290
the manuals that were left behind all
these are manuals that we didn't get I

258
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:22,130
ended up going through one more round
and picking up a bunch of pretty menu to

259
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:28,420
mail to people who had sent me money as
a thank you to harness words aftershock

260
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:39,320
you are thank you and and I wanted to
thank justice huge

261
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,760
you know

262
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:52,300
combination it's a bunch of people
wishing something to come true just be a

263
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:58,430
power nap our I press the right button
but because they believe what I believe

264
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,820
which was this isn't the way it should

265
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:10,870
with just a room destroyed wasn't pretty
was it nice I left a bunch of flowers

266
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:18,610
for Becky the thinker and I left a
bottle of scotch for Nick thank him for

267
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:27,210
giving it away and and that should have
been that's the story of where it ended

268
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,700
at one point and I suppose I could walk
away

269
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,080
laws and yeah look a mess but the reason
ever done

270
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,640
few days later somebody said this was
really special what you did you should

271
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,700
consider organizing this to happen again
in the future so he registered for me

272
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:57,350
archive court dot com archive for dotnet
archive.org and its up your CH IVD the

273
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,890
RPS

274
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:08,580
and I put up a mailing list that said
700 people signed up within a week

275
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,670
30 percent of them are professionals in
the archiving librarian science so

276
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:27,540
suddenly I have an army ready to go at a
moment's notice I came back a few weeks

277
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,450
later and here's the thing again

278
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:39,299
an people whose hands slowly come out of
the snack pack and come to the keyboard

279
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:44,840
and provide their wisdom and people
explained to me that this was awful

280
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:52,389
everything every single thing he knew
there were other people considered me

281
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:56,510
awful for the project awful for the
process and they had all sorts of

282
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:03,639
reasons for it being one fundamental one
which I liked actually born into was it

283
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:10,370
was kind of bad to leave these boxes in
a storage unit on direct concrete

284
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:15,929
concrete which sup moisture and you were
looking at you know you're basically use

285
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:22,970
the first layer of these boxes as a kind
of moisture pad for the rest of it so we

286
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:28,019
made sure that we got pallets and
replaced them all up on pallets and in

287
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:33,679
doing so labeled generally what was in
the box and so that process is ongoing

288
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,450
so maintenance continues to be an issue
in the process of building those things

289
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:44,659
up I've been in contact with museums I
worked for the Internet Archive and

290
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:52,840
things so can scan a lot of things I
have now now that I am unintentional one

291
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:59,100
of the largest most non profitable
manual businesses in the United States I

292
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,149
was informed by a collector who does the
sort of thing a lot something I didn't

293
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:08,440
even think Oh which was leased up
careful what you say could destroy this

294
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,830
market you know manual + chose to get
out to simply because of building but

295
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,169
there are other people who are
maintaining barely scraping by keeper

296
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:24,159
Manuel businesses and I come out with
like manuals are free now some of them

297
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:33,250
may just dumps threw them out of that
business so step carefully which is more

298
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:40,399
than I listened to so we're the HP Mini
is different than the Tektronix manuals

299
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:48,389
world other than I'm trying to put
online things that have no commercial

300
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:55,080
value a rule eventually I believe exists
for all these manuals are online because

301
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,320
that's where I come from and so becoming
a part of a thing

302
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,500
unintentionally remember I went from
Wednesday to this would be neat to

303
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:14,620
wednesday I have everything now what the
old joke about you know buying box sets

304
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,870
like literally heard the Allman Brothers
I think all of the Allman Brothers and

305
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,649
that's what it is now gotten manuals
places in the forties manuals from

306
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:28,639
companies I've never heard of
electronics I mean I have to point out

307
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:35,490
something told me that the model for
flute electronics which was if it works

308
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:43,279
it's a fluke ensure that was being told
the people in 1968 but I just heard it

309
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:51,210
funny holds up so we've got weird little
places that are going on until this

310
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,590
process is ongoing

311
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:59,809
I did not get my hands on an old car I
acquired a puppy gonna have needs I

312
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:05,590
don't have to pay attention so there's a
responsibility that comes with this and

313
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:09,039
like I said that's where I started to
run into interesting arguments about

314
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,710
like well you did it wrong and they're
right by the way let's let's be straight

315
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:20,059
up straight up here with my powerful
hindsight Time Machine I realize I

316
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:27,620
should have used Gaylords which are a
style of large bins of paladin Gaylords

317
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,620
tax things in the Gaylords

318
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,850
lifted them into a truck and taken them
away we would have done it

319
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,559
we would have been much more aggressive
probably would have been much more

320
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,720
effective and given us more leeway

321
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,200
know that didn't know that next time
will be better

322
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:52,020
discussed from some artists about
manuals on the floor before they were

323
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,750
being placed into the boxes and an
overriding hatred must say that this is

324
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:04,220
a small sliver professional artists but
it hit me because I was really hurt by

325
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:11,119
them because that doesn't work I just
meant in terms of damage my back and I'm

326
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,750
still in my back I really should see a
doctor about this but I was sitting

327
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:22,220
there with my hurt back and my car had
blown so you know the axle came loose

328
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:29,859
shot through the transmission which
turns out to be expensive to fix I was

329
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:36,210
like oh surely this number can be up new
car so I have a new car now that I am

330
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:43,570
releasing because my old car died for
this so so so

331
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:50,400
but they had ideas about it and one of
them was discussed managers that I was

332
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:59,770
utilizing an army of volunteers and this
process better only one person this fire

333
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,270
but it always that one person who
remembers and it would have been better

334
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:12,320
for it all to buy a bunch of amateurs
with no clear plan and I was initially

335
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,880
really bothered because we let it get to
me and then I realized this is exactly

336
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,780
what happened with open source software

337
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:28,830
period right after 9597 if you were
there for all the engineers who spent 20

338
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:34,480
years working on a network driver that
would never go down when why the fuck is

339
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,140
everyone planning this fourteen-year-old
idiot who made a driver that sucks and

340
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:47,140
it was because I've got every
certification I did everything I was

341
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:52,760
supposed to I followed all the rules and
their hosting this bastard he's a year

342
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,370
oh well two reasons number one when you
can't pay people accolade and and

343
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:07,470
emotion and expression of joy and
support for the payment and the other

344
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,850
one was not everything you were doing
made sense and could be done by amateurs

345
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,670
and then there were parts that couldn't
be done by amateurs consulting during

346
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,090
somebody down the pace who is saying
something beyond belief stupid just like

347
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:30,430
speech do but in being like fifty-five
and all these other skills went up you

348
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,990
were you were fired from a job he
thought you would have some river and

349
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:40,690
got either a better job or you weren't
doing a job that an MGM and the archives

350
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:46,920
are now realizing this like I said I've
said basically hey we're doing

351
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:53,940
tracheotomy he's Monday so if you could
come to this warehouse in Finksburg

352
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:01,620
30 people apnea really so come over
around in there and just kind of fix

353
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:09,890
that out here he said well you know some
subreddits would be a fourth but the

354
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:24,710
others would be the distance procedures
and don't have somebody who called

355
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,180
himself in our system works in that
community and right now right now they

356
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:37,810
are cutting out this part of the talking
to each other and freeze frame this

357
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:46,240
because the fact that people off the
street are perceived as good as you are

358
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:55,490
is your fault that is your fault what I
know after I dug through the piles of

359
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:00,770
course she took up a few cornball
nuggets of wisdom from this was that

360
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:06,500
what was important was the stuff and
that we could make other decisions later

361
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,870
maybe even get rid of it all but I do
know that when I went back to this place

362
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:19,540
that's the sweat I generated bags and
boxes and I walked back and this is

363
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:25,020
what's less why and let me please
address this right now I've mentioned

364
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,490
Becky alot wise and Becky and there's
that's because Becky got death threats

365
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:33,320
customers so I'm not gonna put back his
picture in 2002 @ thing that you can

366
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,490
choose to put pictures up she had people
who thought this was a conspiracy theory

367
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:43,520
that Nick was trying to destroy
everything on purpose or reason no one

368
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,520
can operate as soon as Cope's doesn't
really strike me as I

369
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:56,590
long range plan for evil I don't know so
you know left in the dearth of

370
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:00,910
information people dreamed up their own
answers and and what I know was when i

371
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:07,500
walked through this the final pieces of
this place I knew what we had done right

372
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,740
I knew that we were looking at Shell
that used to hold all of this human

373
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,180
knowledge that we're now gone they are
gone they were dumped stirred everything

374
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,190
we didn't take was gone and if we had
moved if I had not broken my back if I

375
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:26,120
had not moved other people to take that
they took that leap and they took other

376
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,120
people with them to bring that leap in
this would have been everything I knew

377
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,410
we made the right choice and in your
life right it's not always going to be

378
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:52,550
no problem and good show on Netflix and
YouTube videos can be so you'll see a

379
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:59,210
project that you'll be told he's just
two hours but they really need you and

380
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:04,580
it ends up being eight hours you weren't
taking advantage of that means they

381
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,460
needed you even more than they thought
and that's the kind of thing I want to

382
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,560
see right I'm not I'm rapidly not
becoming a hacker in the general sense

383
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,950
of being some sort of you know tinkering
chrysalis waiting to bloom into an

384
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:26,970
InfoSec butterfly that's not really my
path my path is understanding that in

385
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,430
the menendez technical knowledge here
there was so much knowledge to be gained

386
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:35,250
and what we do and how we make our lives
better and and what makes us cry but

387
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:40,020
makes us happy and one of our families
and the films that are here in people

388
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,680
care about us that's the stuff that I
really really really really care about

389
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,960
more than this exploiter somebody made a
plea go sideways

390
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:57,970
you know at the end of the day I ended
up with this guy I walked into a

391
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:09,180
situation that I thought was like a week
later I had this i three of this by the

392
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,349
way and that was the difference that one
week made in my life doing this right

393
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:21,250
then these manuals are being scanned
some already online I'm gonna have them

394
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:25,619
scant especially by the archive and work
through them that way then try to go for

395
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:30,210
the rare ones first got negotiations in
with home there's just endless amount of

396
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:34,000
phone calls and work ahead maybe more
work than was done that day but it's

397
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,300
work that I'm really going to enjoy the
do a week later archive core got a call

398
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,849
from the Industrial Workers of the World
the I W them and they said we heard

399
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:52,150
about archive core and we've got some
file cabinets full of old I W W stuff

400
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,220
we've tried to get some places to do it
but they're barely hanging on with the

401
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,859
keeping it in the only have time to scan
it really want to put it online there's

402
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:02,839
some of these old books that we have
about ourselves and love for them to go

403
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:08,830
online just you know stuff going back to
1905 that we have in our offices will

404
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:13,970
probably skip firebomb so we move on
this at some point

405
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:27,310
and I was like we'll be right there
thank you very much

406
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:37,480
I will take over the crowd of ppl
bulging out to get to the next talk I

407
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,450
can't even see anybody here so boldness
is encouraged

408
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:49,920
wow this has been a fantastic oil
painting I am really proud to have been

409
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,620
with you I will be here all week I'm not
flying out or doing anything I'm happy

410
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,930
to talk about the Internet Archive and
happy to talk about the projects we do

411
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,560
here if you've got a whole bunch of
manuals maybe hold off design a punch

412
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,700
you but if there's a whole bunch of
other stuff

413
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,680
happy to talk with you about it and it's
