1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:40,410
audience could give a wireless thank you
for coming today I was actually know

2
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,110
your presentation today that's good

3
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,690
this talk is going to be about how to
create a dynamic footprint inventory

4
00:00:52,690 --> 00:01:35,900
organizations is for testing today
questioned you pick the wrong room

5
00:01:35,900 --> 00:02:11,690
the russians 52 you doing security about
15 years just and what I wanted to get

6
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,240
started here I want to die if context I
was told there's a pretty broad

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,910
experience of folks how many of you in
the room our penetration testers never

8
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:28,380
how many of you do some sort of red team
accountability management ok how many

9
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,010
folks hurt your first year doing this
your brand new the the pen test World

10
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:40,910
Cup folks how many of you have more than
five years of experience more than two

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,090
years of experience

12
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:57,489
external penetration testing as consults
her customers how many of you who read

13
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:07,320
for an actual organization trying to
defend something to decide what what you

14
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,239
out of being talked about

15
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:20,510
from red Jeep scoping and its gonna talk
about their some tools and data sets

16
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:27,110
that were thinking about any
organizations

17
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:33,780
from a dataset perspective to maintain
its work so first thing as an overview

18
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,220
the world we live in the day

19
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,350
sounds like we got more experience you
probably already know this but the world

20
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:50,820
we live in today as channels work with
our website for digital channel 55

21
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,140
percent of financial transactions today
a digital channels are increasingly

22
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,630
external to the perimeter so we map out
our traditional network test we focus a

23
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,750
lot on the perimeter and you know where
the money is flowing in the transactions

24
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:10,140
occur or be seeing the external so
couple of problems we face you know

25
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,880
where this but our parameters are
decentralizing an extremely rapid rate

26
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,400
dr. day here said basically the
parameters doubling every 18 months

27
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,020
today in the rain that's accelerating
the pieces we need to maintain an

28
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,419
accurate inventory of the assets that
potentially could be priests are often

29
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:36,800
decentralized an organization's
marketing knows about branding logo and

30
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,960
keywords and these are all key
components we should be using to map out

31
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,620
a profiler these kids typically don't
actually work together the socket insert

32
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,640
response people for example often
maintain a past interested based on the

33
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,820
written form teams often don't even know
that they have access to that resource

34
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:59,880
attackers organized and well-funded most
organizations and I first talked to them

35
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,540
have a very delusional saw the internet
they think they have this nice hard and

36
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,220
perimeter now they're acid in the role
that on average refund about 35% more

37
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,990
assets on the internet doing some form
of business to be as high as 45 max but

38
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,100
it's usually a pretty substantial weight

39
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:30,800
their external internet basics they
might run full management skills on a

40
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,460
regular basis for this is nursing then
try to figure out where problems on

41
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,900
Regis house from these old stale
polaroids might be a year old and most

42
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:53,610
other areas building security key card
access log internal marking the sins so

43
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:00,590
looking at our assets from outside the
once your models little old this day and

44
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,870
age especially the way that's wrapped
things we develop software so three

45
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,920
other annoying issues when trying to
create an accurate in its digital

46
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,440
footprint everything out there the test
first of all once you get out there and

47
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,290
start looking around to fly it's
actually one of the first challenges is

48
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,980
there so many impersonating apps
applications especially in the mobile

49
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:31,930
world out there in person or
organisation your testing it's probably

50
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,860
up to do good to figure out what's
really stop the other one is again when

51
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,530
I talk to or anything outside the
perimeter of the usual 30 monitoring it

52
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,080
so they don't actually know what's going
on in the middle of the night I know the

53
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,180
pictures hard this

54
00:06:51,180 --> 00:07:00,880
really annoying and this is the one that
actually the most amazing to me this has

55
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,509
been growing for a decade but it's the
rapid growth in client-side code and

56
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,229
third-party libraries when we look at a
given web application or asset

57
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:17,590
increasingly large amounts of it can be
three-fourths of the application by

58
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,410
strangers often by people in eastern
europe that are not friends increasingly

59
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,630
this all these interactive dog
JavaScript libraries and why that's

60
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,000
interesting is the fundamental model by
which we develop software has changed

61
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,380
security the SDLC adopted was not at
fault to be able to trust that is

62
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,190
increasingly dynamic load libraries
people systems other people see at

63
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,490
runtime for the notion of being a source
code is sort of a snapshot of you

64
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,060
looking to build server library if
you're not hosting it it's kind of a

65
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,530
relevant security only matters at the
runtime the user session and most ceases

66
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:13,630
third-party security people at this
party on site so I went to talk to me

67
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,639
just ask provider last fall

68
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,590
SAS provider the problem everybody in
the room

69
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:25,110
uses I was curious cuz they were one of
the first folks I saw there were running

70
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,410
New Relic in production is everybody
know it does anybody and everybody know

71
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,460
it relegates

72
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,140
Jesse lot of nose is one of those
libraries like like gift for example

73
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:43,370
Russell huge chocolate 20,000
essentially would it is these folks took

74
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,170
the traditional performance management
things like tea leaves that are very

75
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,290
heavy and they made lights shops
lightweight Javascript and service I

76
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:57,620
components performance monitoring
essentially dropped the site back all

77
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,790
these metrics

78
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:12,560
really chief of security because of its
misc there's a bugger problem now

79
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,430
everything inside every user session is
exposed in being recorded by by new

80
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:23,010
relics controls in place around and I
wouldn't start talking to see so this

81
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:29,540
case not a single see so do the day
running the relative reduction so I

82
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:38,980
asked to see how was the risk profile by
which made the decision to do different

83
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,580
way to basically tell you that I ninety
percent of the organization doesn't know

84
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,130
it but I'm sure the 99% York doesn't
know it's running and production so this

85
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,180
is an example there's all these
different components and that's

86
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,580
interesting over the last year we're
starting to see reaches publicized and I

87
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,819
could talk towards these things are
never is for their penetration test

88
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:10,039
one that was compromised last fall with
start seeing you heard of bin starts

89
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,509
media so they're like the fastest
growing CDL

90
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:20,709
seventy million dollars business owners
they sell directly so they're slipping

91
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:30,019
away it's it's good for business

92
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:38,149
the problem is they were moving news

93
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:46,279
attackers figured out that 2062
organization's web assets was biased or

94
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:52,049
compromise so this vulnerability exposed
reply to all people to test for the

95
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:57,100
particular companies are not picking
months no one was the content that they

96
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:04,100
weren't they thought they weren't
authorized to sell more than interesting

97
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:14,139
dead bodies so security is one of those
libraries everywhere now probably your

98
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:18,389
organization runs keys somewhere my
brother did dozens of places they're

99
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:23,689
basically the log as long as Facebook
Twitter and then another one that grows

100
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:26,639
and sells directly to the business so
they're essentially an authentication

101
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:33,069
bypass new way for the business to
handle never actually know that that's

102
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:43,629
there were some of the other controls

103
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:47,020
return they get to see the social
network

104
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:57,830
they discovered that unfortunately is
hosting was also electronic army and

105
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,690
these are the only ones we know about
the hacktivists is exciting but

106
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:08,490
essentially going to redirect the
library loaded one of its components

107
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,720
from their activism message with the
coded anything they want it again there

108
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:26,610
should be a test that I wanted to share
with you want this when we think I'm

109
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,200
gonna talk about web mobile is an
interesting one to the reason I bring up

110
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:45,100
mobile is this is a great way to get
into organization parking lots of things

111
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:54,100
to see in the parking lot says cue for
layoffs in milan gets over do that so

112
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:03,770
some old and this is just a placeholder
in mind when when the snap a compromise

113
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:10,190
which begs the question like what is the
Scuba testing they first tried to say

114
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:17,980
this but their API was fond of using it
but we went out there started looking at

115
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,280
the school problem with the receipts
hundred and seventy-four broke snapshot

116
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:32,790
out when the snow but it's a great way
for lost interest in testers as

117
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,320
defenders we have to keep it on that as
well we're doing testing social media is

118
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:48,040
also another wonderful place in this
case and some bad people compromising

119
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,360
took it over and always pay attention to
it and they made it what I call us a

120
00:13:51,360 --> 00:14:01,340
reverse gift card giveaway what they did
is where the greatest well the potential

121
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:28,280
things to think about it high-level now
let's dig into would but we actually

122
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:39,040
assets including the search party shadow
I tiananmen a so how do we go about

123
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,670
doing that will the first and most
important task is I want to look at how

124
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:51,550
to do this fully targeted from the
adversarial so we have three cheers of

125
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,200
adversaries want to think about you know
we have the random opportunist

126
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,740
we have directed opportunistic this is a
secret service verbiage from years ago

127
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,580
and they used to work with Verizon on
their data breaches

128
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,140
random opportunistic which is directed
opportunistic which since the script

129
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,820
kiddies or people running automated
scanners the difference between the two

130
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,630
is bottom ones don't think you should
actually log in and run a scanner that

131
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:26,780
sort of thing it used to be a lot of
activity from target upset and that's

132
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:32,870
completely changed at all saying that
now extremely well-funded organized

133
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,010
adversaries

134
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:39,340
when I talk to workers doing red cheeks
day and even some of the consultancy's

135
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,710
junior's streak scanner jockey I'm
always fascinated when they when they

136
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,440
talk about the scopes to sculpture being
set by the clients you know or by song

137
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,160
some middle manager guy trying to sell a
lot of using closing quickly and there's

138
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,040
a lot of scanner jockey work it's like
if you can get here to the domain

139
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,600
controller and what I don't see a lot of
framing out how an adversary would

140
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,840
actually go out attacking the
organization that's where the drive home

141
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:19,400
so whenever series starts out in the
breaches of helping customers that they

142
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:25,260
do actually doing the traditional
network it's making a list of all the

143
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,280
actual and that other businesses its
listing out their corporate strategy and

144
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,700
looking at their axes facing today many
of them are playing the long dark

145
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,600
interesting I'm seeing in many examples
are contesting and management is not

146
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:49,580
taking into account this long by that I
mean as these folks are these folks are

147
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:57,820
going in their profile positions in the
network are seeing this over and over in

148
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,640
the last year and also profiling cuban
city sex fishing is still one of the

149
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,140
number one

150
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,850
so the first place we should Crisco
fractional footprints mapping out all

151
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:18,670
the organizations step two is
traditional network mapping and I'm not

152
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:24,360
gonna go through this a lot of detailed
presentations what I'm gonna do at the

153
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,920
end once I get fully sure this I'm going
to publish the surveillance Survey

154
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,180
Monkey I'll give you my contact info

155
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,360
interested in the survey an Survey
Monkey and tell me what you want more of

156
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,680
what you think these things are
explained well enough I will put more

157
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,080
info breaking down how to consult he's
probably everybody knows how to use and

158
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,700
now everybody the room so that you can
use Google and to some degree of mapping

159
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,480
of those services exposed

160
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,020
everybody in here you show them for
fingerprints off really good

161
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,930
presentations after last year's show and
then we have traditional shopping when

162
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,940
you're doing your profile an
organization and you start mapping it

163
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,520
out

164
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:18,920
do any of you use your Google actually
look for binary docs s so that's an

165
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,440
interesting area where I find it quite a
few were decisions are not doing that

166
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,940
it's not it's cool I know it's time
consuming but just to share we've had

167
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,400
two organizations and we found that
publish lists one in a Word doc on an

168
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,680
excel file that they had entire list of
one user IDs and passwords for critical

169
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,720
applications and another had the
connections trees and passwords for all

170
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:47,240
their internal database configuration
they're opposed to see exposed to some

171
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,220
extent testing

172
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:55,850
crowds so I want to stress this again
one of the most important pieces that is

173
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:01,750
often not in scope you have to work with
your customers or your internal teams

174
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,620
can understand scrooge's last to find
out about this

175
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,409
to proactively have a system by which
are out there looking for as for

176
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:14,659
documents thats the filing there's an
intent to acquire this can be an ass for

177
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:20,990
dog and then once the acquisition is
going through the form 8 case and I

178
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:27,260
believe it section 9 of Section eight or
nine cases they list the assets

179
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,080
organizational a date by which their
decisions now legally accountable for

180
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,210
those assets are reached a compromise so
these are some good sources of data

181
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,480
define the size and the reason this is
this is important as we were saying

182
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,750
we're nation states are going into
subsidiaries the minute they heard

183
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,539
they're going into acquisition targets
the minutes announced in a compromising

184
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:53,140
them and we tried cases where they've
been going on the compromised systems

185
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,419
that are unlikely to change quick like
conference room of the last things are

186
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,590
you get swapped out things running the
TVs so they're going to compromise our

187
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,870
then they just sit and wait and I might
be months but eventually the corporate

188
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,380
network in them once they're inside the
parent company that had an otherwise

189
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,580
hardened perimeter then they're off to
the races we also find this is actually

190
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:22,460
pretty sure we started number of cases
in acquisition where the company being

191
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,650
enquirer provides a list of assets to
the corporate parent that they have in

192
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:34,090
those lists are in action and they don't
actually have Jason's back sometimes

193
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,590
it's like there's a guy in there that
knows exactly what system

194
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,280
erased other spreadsheet

195
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,360
so that's the number one thing we've
been fighting for getting compromised

196
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,340
and then the second one which are
brought up earlier was third party

197
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:56,050
components and the pieces we want all
the things we have extremely sorry

198
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:02,340
what's what service I components
component analysis that's always one of

199
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,700
the top things that used to prioritize
and you know where they running you know

200
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,550
actually those points their internal
network party libraries are they running

201
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:21,600
and then the last quarter connections
and you don't example in here is how

202
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:28,730
many of you are familiar with this is
another woman a lot of companies wrong

203
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:34,000
one past tense I mean assume that
there's another one point aliquot had

204
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,700
some challenges around sequel injection
and being able to run arbitrary code on

205
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,660
the system's what happens is people set
up fell across the don't want to manage

206
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,930
a lot of the marketing content campaigns
and the plug it into their website and

207
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:53,520
then what happens the data they process
their marketing stuff and then lost in

208
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,610
turn around impassive back the front end
web at 3 Apr sometimes right back in the

209
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,890
back into your own systems and so what
happens in these situations usually I T

210
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,510
doesn't have a lot of involvement of
involvement helical actually block

211
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,120
scanners and security test the contracts
they have not let you do any testing but

212
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,410
yeah there now and invest

213
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,820
you know with an untested trust on that
often goes back in 2008 taxes would go

214
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:27,140
into a website that you can run and jump
back in the journal database with or

215
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:34,620
without scanners and we don't test
Eliquis little things are left out of

216
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,230
scope large

217
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:51,720
third-party against back was my target
and so when I want to you know I

218
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,590
actually don't enjoy the CTF game just
to make sure she gets like who's the

219
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:04,270
actual target who am I gonna compromise
that I'm going to use to get something

220
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,980
from the company or impact their
business actually demonstrate the impact

221
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:17,590
this is going to go through the
targeting the results pretty disastrous

222
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,110
I give you an example the pre-owned
attacks there was a couple of years back

223
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:30,090
to the skin and need access uncertain
systems

224
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:35,450
filings before they were actually
released and so I started doing market

225
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:41,960
manipulation of the media for the
company since all those extremely

226
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:57,559
disruptive and her so these are these
are essential actual rule so once we

227
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,480
have those profile then we go back

228
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,700
network mapping mapping on all the third
party components the merger and

229
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,630
acquisition

230
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:12,020
these are things you gonna do
predominately was searching are you

231
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:18,380
really need to call whether scale and
since there's no doubt that helped start

232
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:24,050
research but to make an accurate digital
the pieces are pretty essential to me I

233
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,530
want to know what all the actual brands
are with the brand terms are and start

234
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,420
with their teammates number one second I
want to know what you were gonna get the

235
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,830
marketing department to tell me these
things are putting in search engines and

236
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,810
I wanna know what all their logos are
and then I wanna find all the places

237
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:45,370
those used on the internet from there we
can get around those get to that I also

238
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:50,400
wants so one thing that's pretty
essential to me for maintaining this for

239
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,860
an external contestas against all don't
usually get access to internal

240
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:02,000
information but if a partnership with
the organization so one of the best

241
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,060
places to get that information is is
referral aux and also get girls from and

242
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,160
eventually you can work with in order to
whitelist what's internal intranet and

243
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,500
the reason these things are important
city refers to start mine three when it

244
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,960
start finding things that are not their
assets are using their logos and things

245
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,440
like that and see things getting pulled
into refers to start finding hidden

246
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,900
iframe compromise and hope you find a
lot of things like what the developers

247
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,160
are setting up in the Amazon Cloud for
example surroundings to each other

248
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:47,250
extracted out on an example to the
database same thing with mobile app

249
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:52,790
so awesome oral sex without putting all
this in a database indexing we want to

250
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,110
do is we want to find out

251
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:01,260
place we probably got this from we want
to find out where their developers are

252
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,010
going for their tech support for their
GPAs joe for support for their desktop

253
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:13,530
support just 34 weeks ago I was working
with the pen test on an engagement and

254
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,840
the developer she had logged in

255
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,580
Developer Network and had uploaded
entire database starts into essentially

256
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,930
what was the public forum you just had a
lawyer in this database user IDs and

257
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:33,740
passports for the applications we spent
all this time trying to you you know

258
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,470
increasingly gets harder defines things
like Siebel injection line and we can

259
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:51,890
have a really hard time doing that
developers skirts I want to stop right

260
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:58,090
here now so far how many of you are
actively mining today how many of you

261
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:09,140
actively go online tech support
monitoring very cold how many of your

262
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:16,920
monitoring public source this is
actually been one of the biggest ones

263
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,970
i've seen

264
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,230
what's happened is some of the couple
that works I work with the testing of

265
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,760
customers increasingly gotten their
network parameters heart so it's harder

266
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,920
and harder for them to hack in there
more where fishing etcetera and so they

267
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,430
have to become more and more creative to
break in the organization and this is

268
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,720
the same thing that we're seeing
adversaries in eastern europe to their

269
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,100
monitoring the public sources those kind
of things are looking for is will find

270
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,640
this all the time will find hard coded
stuff in the code like passwords

271
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:55,920
connection strengths we find hard coded
be hardcoded Adobe attached inside the

272
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,190
public source code repo obviously
traditional type former police simply by

273
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,240
looking to the source

274
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:13,570
now the thing that it gives you doing
multiuser role model as the whole apps

275
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:20,230
uploaded a public source code one
example of this is rehired up with a

276
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,100
prank called up and said hey you know
where they were pretty upset like our

277
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,400
pin testing from arab sex telling us are
out has noble were coming through the

278
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,030
same thing our users or customers can
not use our applications are serving up

279
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:46,600
now but there's no vulnerabilities and
it's actually extremely robust looks

280
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,630
pretty good about where we start talking
to me like what had to come in this week

281
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,770
has no traffic anywhere else and they
had in line IPS they were looking

282
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:03,840
through web server logs you can probably
guess back to collecting right after

283
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,850
asking a few questions it became clear
they weren't logging any posted and

284
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,400
their IPS wasn't looking at post
requests quest log which is normal

285
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,980
people

286
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,799
and the reason I was curious because it
just popped up a bunch of pressure where

287
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,910
they had logging was just marketing
registration register here to get our

288
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,500
email

289
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,020
well long story short what happened is
part of consolidation and cost

290
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,230
efficiencies taking all that the new
brochure with their standing up and they

291
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:38,990
plugged it into the production database
to serve the primary so then the bad

292
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,799
guys came along the marketing sign up
there in the databases database with

293
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,980
Mauer I don't even know if they knew
they were in the banking and so the

294
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:53,080
banking was fetching malware for records
serving it up to the snow in the primary

295
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,850
option was to share data source but
these marketing outside then set it

296
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,190
outside of scope penetration testing
because they were so I'm sure you've

297
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,990
seen this before posting your profile
look at these things at the template for

298
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:11,190
the marketing outs was up and get up to
simply wanted to give you a live example

299
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:20,030
hear this but just to give you an
example of the interesting things you

300
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:28,669
can get up and running about a 30 second
where we found over $356 things are hard

301
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:36,090
coded so it's pretty easy to refine this
by organization you know buyer for an

302
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:41,320
entire development that's the goal of
further into the things we want to

303
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,549
capture search engine mining how many of
you actively today are using search

304
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:48,820
engine mining on a recurring basis

305
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,970
your pen testing program

306
00:30:53,970 --> 00:31:04,389
sure you are so so there's less acute
strange and automated scripts a great

307
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:07,519
tool kit if you're not using it and
there's a presentation from a couple

308
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,059
years ago

309
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:15,100
Bishop Fox has a bunch of different
search engine mining components and it

310
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,529
also as binary document analysis to look
for a lot of common read texts and you

311
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:24,500
can add your own employees this sort of
thing but it's gonna look for Socius

312
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,779
what you want to do is your building
this profile I get this text you want to

313
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:32,169
have an inventory in your digital
footprint you actually using what

314
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:42,480
external email addresses where names
piece that we're seeing surgeon and

315
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,960
mining used for today is if you drink
physical security extract a lot of

316
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,610
location how to the metadata from
pictures 25 locations

317
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:59,889
the reason I was actually interesting
from a Pinterest concrete example we're

318
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:06,570
doing a pen test on or and they're
they're most interesting insensitive

319
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:11,720
federally regulated information needs
testing and the aids testing facilities

320
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,210
because it had problems with with
bailing pen test before had been

321
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:20,279
isolated on a separate physical networks
so they have the physical buildings were

322
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:24,679
they did all these patients testing in
in there they had computer systems or

323
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:31,159
isolated any other networks but what
happened in those buildings we found 60

324
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,139
able to get into the main corporate
network and everything we gotta go we

325
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:39,950
actually don't really care what they
really care about all those buildings

326
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,029
have lobbies and all those levees were
running the same system that the vendor

327
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:49,610
install with Si and set a password is
running Microsoft server was listening

328
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:56,190
on the network and they rent Cisco's IP
telephony plug into the Cisco phone and

329
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,620
then pass their magic packet you know
and get on that on the deal and then you

330
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,309
could see the door access server and it
opened it up and then just walk out with

331
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:12,460
machine so the physical during this hour
lol final locations the actual buildings

332
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:22,039
so the pieces coming to the end here
this is the biggest the biggest choice

333
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm about to get into missing from
programs give you a lot more accurate

334
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,879
visibility into how many of you today
are doing who is mining to find us says

335
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:39,610
in your portfolio and organization we've
got some folks out there this was pretty

336
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:46,799
underestimated so so when you get your
list of domains and refine that all the

337
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,399
domain assets you own all the who stands
in the next step that you want to take

338
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:56,360
you want to go out there and who is in
you want to find contact us the stand

339
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,639
there with those and treat those assets
as well one you're gonna find some

340
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:07,870
interesting stuff the stuff that's
registered the problem should second

341
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:13,419
thing is once we have sent information
we want to take that list of people

342
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:18,429
their names email addresses and phone
numbers and we want to go back to who is

343
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:25,210
Google and we want to go back and we
want to see what else can we start doing

344
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:30,619
that patterns will emerge that are very
interesting example was we had a couple

345
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:35,859
cases where we found in situations where
road mobilize being used to compromise

346
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:39,970
users particularly in health care and in
the end

347
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:46,060
won the demographics are going after was
like 35 75 alt males as the ED marketing

348
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,179
firms electric

349
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:54,490
reptile dysfunction drugs like 20 bucks
record so so we found this pattern where

350
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,230
there are these absolute security team
softies a solution they were extremely

351
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,790
professional they were well made they're
actually better than the legitimate

352
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,599
applications organization had written
but one sleep it off the authors

353
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,540
republishing these published twenty
different healthcare insurance companies

354
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,099
and it was all the same person who kept
publishing these out so obviously your

355
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:22,970
spidey senses are tingling when you see
that this kid sister in the other woman

356
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,760
we found it was really interesting while
initially creating this profile for

357
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,200
organizational process we actually a
group of employees that have registered

358
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,920
a bunch of assets it to make sure that
we went looked at him as it looked like

359
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,160
a competitor and what it turned out to
be a long story short this was a group

360
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,859
of employees that was getting ready to
lead organization and they had started

361
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:55,440
up a smaller firm that they were
compared using their corporate email

362
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,460
sure he'll find all the houses in this
competitive bidding laws of God about

363
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:12,220
managing your red team or intestines of
pasadena City how many folks in here

364
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:19,460
know what passes ok handful of folks
must read Intel community makes

365
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,890
extensive use of Pasadena's profiling
attackers infrastructure and usually

366
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:30,710
somebody in your socks incident response
to work they probably have access to

367
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:36,020
database getting it from someone like
the far side of the smaller projects

368
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,010
after lunch

369
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:51,760
be getting it from my organization is
not using Pasadena Pasadena which is

370
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,180
where people are what are they
requesting what are they going to cry

371
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,370
out records which is what people
registered like what you get from our

372
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:04,200
site would renew domains that are
registered so there's domains are

373
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,650
actually registered out there this is
how you find new things popping up if

374
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:12,190
your marketing marketing teams that
sometime set up from Marshalls out on

375
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:20,330
the internet about 11 or go to work with
that he was February alone they got

376
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:25,620
breached twice in a row as marketing
setup campaigns collecting PII and they

377
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:32,160
set them up or some such a separate
stopwatch until you find these things or

378
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:39,420
possibly the best new domains registered
so you can buy it externally and again

379
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:46,200
another two other sources of passive
demeanor extract out of referral office

380
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,800
that's going to be more fun occasions to
compromise and we're actually you can

381
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:58,750
get that out of gmail email system that
easy way to do it if you get a lot of

382
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,970
their employment protection are moving
towards the light extract that

383
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:12,970
information and here's an example of how
many of you work with organizations some

384
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:19,650
former Raptor a job fell thru how many
abuses at me this organization's way of

385
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:24,980
getting the code from the developer to
stop production as quickly as possible

386
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:31,740
organizations doing running bill is
anybody doing running bills right now

387
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:38,220
you do auto deployment so we have risked
IQ

388
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:45,040
specializing in trying to solve this
problem of identifying these assets that

389
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,810
still don't know about you control over
and against regime lot of something they

390
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,070
have control over it

391
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:55,510
you start showing up all the stuff it's
usually pretty eye-opening one of most

392
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,869
critical once you pass a DNS we actually
had the same kind of challenge this is

393
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:04,240
what got us really interested a while
back we had one of our large financially

394
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,800
as a customer went through management
she said you know pushed target rich

395
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,710
world someone freaked out they were
going to dinner management that we've

396
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:20,550
got a vendor that doesn't have an active
disaster recovery as you know we try to

397
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:25,050
explain it in the information collecting
the giving it to him as always and so we

398
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,570
can be created on the fly but
nonetheless they're like oh you've gotta

399
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:33,330
do this thing immediately you know you
can have enduring and so so one of our

400
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,000
folks in engineering

401
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,850
configured are audible systems in the
Amazon Cloud and boom turned it loose

402
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:45,340
and so started school all these copycat
notes the Amazon Cloud luckily these

403
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,060
were were dumping test systems but we
split up like 60 notes the Amazon Cloud

404
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,560
with a lot of build server nobody had
set up that ought to build server with

405
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,150
any of the configs appear on our
production software

406
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:02,920
so it's all so literally within 24 hours
plots already compromised this all these

407
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,410
notes which spun up in the Amazon Cloud
box already compromised in before the

408
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,650
ITT mini-van gotta start configuring and
using up and so the question is how do

409
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,730
most realization you know how do you how
do you keep an eye on stuff i mean

410
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,020
that's how it happened again the answers
you know how are we gonna find it for

411
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,140
ourselves we're gonna find it was
someone registers domain and ties it to

412
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:32,039
it or in the case of extracting out you
know we extracted from an email that we

413
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,470
sent abroad to go out there and look
connection to go out there and make an

414
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:41,250
HTTP request connected see what's living
there and then we raise a flag you know

415
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,480
there's a lot of stuff there nobody
knows about not running right versions

416
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,210
of software etc we need to go look at
you all the information I just laid out

417
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,500
you want to put this into one database
not want to use it all together smiled

418
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,700
once I love you have all your demands
all your web infrastructure and felt all

419
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,279
the passivity and I and our folks are
using a narrow set the list of users and

420
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:09,099
all that you have your logos all you're
brand marketing running some brand

421
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:13,059
protection monitoring their minority
have a lot of this data marketing might

422
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:16,940
be some landmark monitors out their skin
and around looking for you know

423
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,839
colliding domains and miss you so
bloggers know that you can put this in

424
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:29,029
your list database some of that stuff so
that gives you control a satellite if we

425
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:33,599
automate all this collection and
monitoring what's new we cannot Delta

426
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:41,750
study this very heavy one time we could
start rewarding ourselves change so much

427
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,140
more

428
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,930
process

429
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:53,690
so we've been through most the agenda
now the final piece i wanna talk about a

430
00:41:53,690 --> 00:42:01,819
different way that if we build a system
this way they can do this dynamically we

431
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:07,140
not to treat the annual pen test with
this up from which we certainly should

432
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,650
probably have some third-party do some
manual checks and balances to psyche to

433
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:18,569
an auditor double entry bookkeeping but
as far as actually testing adversary

434
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:23,930
adversaries are not waiting to hear you
know the chinese are monitoring your

435
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:29,010
whoever your adversary is meets my needs
to monetize acts against your

436
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,490
organization when you set things up when
someone in here or the marketing people

437
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,940
free sample to the customer image in
early this year at the gym marketing

438
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:44,000
campaigns they ran a security and said
hey we need help and used as one problem

439
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,130
I don't even know where things are
headed to login right the adversaries

440
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:52,740
are waiting for security team to put in
an authorized Scopus for pen testing

441
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:57,510
obviously about having this data now you
can check that off and so we've been

442
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,829
able to help some banks put this in
place and we see things changing

443
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:06,079
properties around an asset they need to
go they need to go Pinterest properties

444
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:15,640
are indicators we had an organization
one of the largest security product

445
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:22,319
organizations out there I won't name any
names of the next year and we're helping

446
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:29,490
him out this your data is all wrong and
what happened is we found for main line

447
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:33,530
of business applications running on top
of rack space were not running on top of

448
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,030
me terribly secure the date is wrong we
have a policy

449
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:42,470
we don't allow a choice to put anything
on Rackspace and so we had to explain to

450
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:47,120
them that thing about firewalls is up
policies as his policies were really

451
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,180
well when you can put them in a firewall
and stop users from going somewhere but

452
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,570
policies don't work really well when
your marketing people can like pick up

453
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,540
the phone and have a credit card and
call it creative agency and build

454
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,690
something you know on Rackspace and run
it and so all the access controls

455
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,530
obviously didn't do this but if we
simply were extracting out these links

456
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:15,130
from email campaigns link back to other
assets that they wouldn't know about

457
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,650
this long time ago and already been able
to go out there can control of them

458
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,300
moving somewhere secure than just about
everything needed for this database will

459
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:33,560
give us a way to get a handle on shavuot
growth in the cloud so this time I may I

460
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,270
may do a live show you some stuff but
the important thing for me out of this

461
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:46,450
present each there's a there's a couple
different levels to go with this going

462
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,500
forward I could do some more hands on
deeper workshop and shows step-by-step

463
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:56,890
how to actually collect all these pieces
of 07 but the minute I was kinda unsure

464
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:02,050
with the death of a strange necrotic
view today and the other pieces I've

465
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:06,970
been trying to think about what pieces
might be useful to publish the community

466
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,550
to help you enable your own program so
how many of you today as part of your

467
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:17,910
contesting forcing you actively do need
USB forcing you something like fears

468
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:25,059
handful of you do ok so that the lista
come with the DNS tools are pretty small

469
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:30,400
so how many of you are doing that sort
of thing it would be useful for you to

470
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,839
have like a monthly updated like top
chilean hostnames active users on the

471
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:39,069
internet you can use force against Iran
would that be useful

472
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:45,869
couple of you ok how many of you would
like to have access to some kind of

473
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:53,250
lightweight general database and find
actual names that are registered your or

474
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,730
that may be beyond the scope of your
friend or outside that's something that

475
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:04,599
would be useful in your Pinterest
practice saying that I just rolled

476
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:09,589
through how many of you currently have
some type of a workbench or or dashboard

477
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:13,720
that you all this data and you can use
it actively in your pen testing out

478
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,680
anybody have a system or piece of
software used to manage this today

479
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:43,599
get so showing some of this data any
questions at this point no questions

480
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:48,339
which

481
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:55,539
and this was the most interesting to you
hadn't thought about using it in your

482
00:46:55,539 --> 00:47:03,119
penetration testing or throw out an
example of one of these yes sir

483
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,810
ok

484
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:22,250
anybody else 200 K

485
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:26,760
proxy lost another way this is a really
Mohsen another little dirty trick I've

486
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:36,680
seen used as for those of you deploying
whatever it is I got a couple of weeks

487
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:43,610
now that my in order to balance sheets
for all their keys automatically grab

488
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:48,570
those keys and then they have a system
like our system automatically go out and

489
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:52,470
log in and see what content is there and
do some analysis on its a little trick

490
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:59,180
but median estimate so the biggest gap
that I can system is most of the assets

491
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,560
that we find that people don't have are
available through who is or through

492
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,260
passive DNS databases and when they're
getting breach these pieces they almost

493
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,900
every time we find these assets

494
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:16,430
media Nasser who is mining and that's
the idea that I actually so we could

495
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,860
stop here right now would anybody like
to see an example of a live dataset like

496
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:36,700
this and how you come through ok we have
left

497
00:48:36,700 --> 00:50:01,750
let me see if I can I don't know as for
the screen so

498
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:11,130
well how about this if you want to see
how I will sort through this in a live

499
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,670
database of those things where you can
quickly sort through like what all of us

500
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,170
in what service office properties are
running just grabbed me after this show

501
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:30,450
you can see this resolution right now so
I mean stop here with that and thank you

502
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,980
very much for coming today hope this was
helpful for you
