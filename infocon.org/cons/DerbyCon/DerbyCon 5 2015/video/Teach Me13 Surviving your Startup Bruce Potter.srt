1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,180
I think we're gonna start holy shit

2
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,710
levels are going to be really loud so
they'll be super cool it down a notch is

3
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,590
that it's it's a dial on the back with
excellent alright

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,710
respond to talk about surviving your
security startup I guess the question is

5
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,390
how many of you here and start up right
now how many of you are thinking about

6
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,579
starting a startup how do you are
thinking about starting lineup and I

7
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:52,440
want to raise your hands your co-workers
are here just double checking so I

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,860
started my talks in the same basic
premise is that you shouldn't shouldn't

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,690
I know it's boring

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,119
a proper heckman front row today don't
believe anything I say records do not

11
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,490
believe anything you here at this
conference or any other conference I'm a

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:16,130
college dropout just moving requesting
Fairbanks and where is that you must do

13
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:23,950
you have to trust me struggle we
struggled a lot when geography the it's

14
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,330
a tough industry right now because
there's a whole bunch of people who are

15
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,659
entering it now who have gone through
formal programs in computer science

16
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,470
degree Security Network Security
Information Assurance whatever you wanna

17
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,740
call it when I was going to school there
was nothing like that right there made

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,680
an atty masters programs run around in
nothing that was actually real and

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,020
undergrads could wrap your head around
so what I learned a lot of people in my

20
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,799
generation award was on the job right it
was really we cared about it wanna learn

21
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,290
a lot of our own time and energy and
money you know when

22
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,750
we're sitting round up in anchorage and
trying to figure out to do their spare

23
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,590
time you know my wife audience true and
some other people are trying to figure

24
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,890
out you know how to start a hacker
collectives after something like that

25
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,560
and we ended up starting this new groups
and that was effectively our outlet

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,930
that's how we learned was banding
together to do whatever random projects

27
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,030
are you think you know it's the right
grab code or articles are going to

28
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,350
conferences and get up and say just a
bunch of random shit that's what we did

29
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:35,290
and it was great and educational but we
just learn kind of on the fly and no one

30
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,970
told us whether we are right where they
were wrong

31
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,050
how to help us improve we had a figure
that all her own

32
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,400
we're at a point now where we have
formal structured curriculum but we're

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,080
in a world in which the industry moves
very very very quickly write everything

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,920
changes every day which is the opposite
of what happens it's a mechanical

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,670
engineering or you know a lot of other
engineering and hard sciences where

36
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,660
status negotiations are static friction
of sandpaper haven't changed as long as

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,230
we made sandpaper right by the force of
gravity as insane as long as we've been

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,040
alive in on this earth but how we defend
networks now we talked about changes

39
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,850
every day so I know more an expert at
this nobody else here is our encourage

40
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,400
you disagree with anything I say police

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,170
challenge me on it hold me accountable
and I think there's a trend right now to

42
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,519
not holding others accountable as well
like it's one thing for me to stand here

43
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,570
and say challenge me I think challenge
everybody around you as well

44
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:43,420
the industry is is big and giving very
unwieldy and for money and sell outs

45
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,010
thank you see that's my resume I enter
my superhero I get confused as to his

46
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:57,020
role in my life anyway thank you so I've
been through a few startups wanna talk

47
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,630
about today is really my own personal
observations I'm not a business major

48
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,050
urban studied a lot of business I've
been around a lot of failure and a

49
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,680
little bit of success and I would
encourage you to learn from my failures

50
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,400
and at least take my success with a
grain of salt figure out what's right

51
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,220
for you to do

52
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,590
founded a company called Papa
technologies eight years ago and with

53
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,880
CTO there and we recently sold to the
key W corporation which is a mid-size

54
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,840
defense contractor in central Maryland
right got him out and they promoted me

55
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,270
to CTO so dedicated bacterial accident I
now have more responsibility so and to

56
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,800
be clear I'm not a lawyer nothing today
should be construed as legal advice I'm

57
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,910
not going to say it kind of
authoritative Lee when I do a lot of my

58
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,510
work I'll when I'm trying to kind of
conceptualize things are wrap my head

59
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,340
around what it means to do whatever be
its cybersecurity majority models or

60
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,020
whether it be some sort of risk
management they're breaking into this

61
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,060
box never used Google but oftentimes I
use Google Images because I find it so

62
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,120
much faster way of finding out it useful
information then rolling through dual

63
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,669
results he was shocked if you just use
Google Images set a Google how

64
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:16,340
productive you could be so I googled
start-up and I get a whole bunch of

65
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,669
graphics that frankly maybe wanna
fucking parks writes like is this grand

66
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,460
like fine and it's it's set up like on a
soundstage and everyone looks pretty and

67
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,770
happy and isn't trying to kill each
other and wondering what's going to

68
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,880
happen next in my paychecks coming from
know it's you know plants growing in

69
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,360
signage in all kinds of bullshit and
that's not the way it all goes every

70
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,110
startup is different right security
startups in their own breed different

71
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,660
but you know every every startup is
different there's been

72
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,670
lots of books written on the topic I
think there are some decent books that

73
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,400
are out there

74
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,670
Startup America worries 021 which is a
little too platitude for me but I guess

75
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,610
you think there's a whole bunch of
crappy books out there at the end of the

76
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,920
day most amount to the motivational
phrases you see on Facebook every day

77
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,560
there's just a lot of like common sense
and a lot of platitudes and as much as I

78
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,920
would normally time to slide that as it
turns out running a company is a

79
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:25,660
complicated day

80
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:34,430
hi I'm an old man and I don't know
what's happening

81
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:54,740
so years ago so I was at DEFCON and we
were doing the closing address and i got

82
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,600
up on stage and was announcing like you
would want and all this kind of stuff

83
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,160
and we're at the Riviera and I thank the
Alexis park staff which is where they

84
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,950
had been in years prior and everyone's
like Rick the rig drink drinking like

85
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,310
screw you I'm not drinking to get us
into drink and so I kept going and so

86
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,220
virus PC 949 guy comes up with a handle
of something on the counter in front of

87
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,390
me I'm like all right I guess I'll drink
this so mid-sentence I grabbed the

88
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,710
handle and I give it back and go to take
a big swig because I'm a big man and I

89
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,180
could drink my alcohol and when it got
here and I read Everclear upside down I

90
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,280
knew I was in a world of hurt and my
face went red I won't flush my heart

91
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,600
rate spiked I said probably three more
sentences I just pointed said they

92
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,070
wanted I left the stage so I assure you
that warm Smirnoff Ice is not going to

93
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:53,720
intimidate me at all and it's really
warm like on so I the one thing I want

94
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,390
to try to touch on today the specifics
around what make a security startup

95
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,430
different because there are
idiosyncrasies of our industry that I

96
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,250
think are important to realize there are
lots of resources out there and how to

97
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,190
start companies how to run then how to
build your team's how to do whatever

98
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,420
that's not gonna try to cover there will
be some general stuff in here mostly as

99
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,390
observational for me but I'm going to
try to focus on some of the specific

100
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:21,000
security stuff first of all you should
make yourself a company like today right

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,380
when it's really easy to company a calm
he said I want to be in OC credit card

102
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,620
and in some states its online an
automatic and you are a bunch of legal

103
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,350
entity within about 15 minutes in other
states they have to go physically

104
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,280
someone has two career it to the state
courthouse to file it and you pay an

105
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,380
extra fee for some person that actually
will take a piece of physical paper to

106
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,710
do

107
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,830
our house or to the State Building and
filing on your behalf

108
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,900
some states don't allow single entity
LOC so you can be a sole proprietorship

109
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,410
but LC's have zero overhead associated
with them there's no yearly meetings

110
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,080
there's no real bylaws you company dot
com we'll give you like I said I bylaws

111
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,600
you just sign that makes it like I'm
gonna do stuff for money and he signed

112
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,850
it and you're done

113
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,230
there's really no compelling reason when
you start to be an S corporation court

114
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,890
I've been in companies that down the
road and needed to be an SRC corporate

115
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,440
some point and it turns out you can
create the second corporations sell off

116
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,210
the assets to the second corporation and
its fine some lawyers get some money in

117
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,330
the process and beyond that it works out
ok so give yourself an LLC and in your

118
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,910
early stages this is great because if
it's just you you have the flexibility

119
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:37,360
to engage as an LLC and as an individual
under 1099 writes the naughty nineties

120
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,630
attack swarms of people often referred a
1099 it as being an independent

121
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:47,130
contractor if your gonna do work for a
company sometimes they want to engage

122
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,330
you as a company like as an organization
and sometimes it's easier for them to

123
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,600
engage you as a person right if they're
like a subcontractor under an existing

124
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,630
contract already it's very hard to get
to a sumptuous up situation so it's much

125
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,790
easier for them to bring you on as an
independent contractor so in your early

126
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:12,920
days even when I started on attack I had
a co-founder with me and he would 1099

127
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,010
into a client and are going to a
different line LOC and we just had an

128
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,390
agreement that said any money that he
made on the 1099 would go against the

129
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:20,840
problem

130
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,120
company that we had as an LLC and we
just kept track of how much he made on

131
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,380
the 1099 you reconciled it there's
nothing that says when you go into it

132
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,110
was somebody else they always get 50%
you can come up with any kind of ratio

133
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,390
order it that you want and it works out
fine so

134
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,640
after you start the company's you
consider what you want to do there's a

135
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,880
lot of reasons people want to start a
company sometimes you got like a vision

136
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,910
you got something in its urs crashing I
got this idea for this thing that they

137
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,080
can make some money

138
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,190
some people just want to make themselves
at home something they can do that but

139
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,430
some sell for themselves for you know
the foreseeable future

140
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,700
some people want to build something get
rich and sell it is all kinds of

141
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,000
different reasons why you would start a
company but I would encourage you to

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,910
think long and hard about why you're
trying to do it and it's easy to

143
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,630
articulated a bar like mad I got this
great idea but at the end of the day you

144
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,840
know you need to be prepared to dedicate
yourself to this thing and when it goes

145
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,310
sideways be prepared to get out right

146
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,770
have a backup plan no matter what you do
be ready for it not to work out and to

147
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,460
GTFO because things can go totally
sideways there are certainly times upon

148
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:31,440
attack where I had my resume ready and I
was one time we had one client

149
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,660
vaporize the task right we had all our
people on it which was two others

150
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,810
besides me and halfway through I went
out to California to visit him and

151
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,560
pulled up at their office building it's
10 o'clock in the morning on like a

152
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,290
Tuesday and I get people in california
go to work kinda late but there were two

153
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,180
cars in the parking lot like I know the
song I walk up a knock on the door

154
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,610
closed doors not unlocked its there's
nobody there is no perception is nothing

155
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,920
and a CTO who is my client comes up to
the door after a few minutes it says hey

156
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,210
what's up I'm like did you close down
like we ran out of money

157
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:11,020
gonna get paid like no no thanks I'll
get the money we don't you know so well

158
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,260
that was that was this is it this is
what we were doing and we have a lot of

159
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,410
money in the bank so called the other
guys and with them like I would

160
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,580
encourage you to get your resumes ready
and start talking to people and we

161
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,960
managed to pull through but it was it
was a pain in the ass

162
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,000
ask yourself what your market means so
this is where a lot of the start of

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,130
books like lean start-up and things like
that focus on is figuring out what is

164
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,770
your market need how we gonna feel it is
a very complex problem but there's a few

165
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,520
things that I i've taken away from my
years that I think it's worth keeping in

166
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,420
mind one just because you really want to
build a thing doesn't mean that anyone

167
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,500
wants that thing like I've seen plenty
of people with a vision like hey this is

168
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,020
awesome idea that I have and it's
awesome to you and it's awesome to

169
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,470
nobody else particularly not often
people to have the money right

170
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,150
like it's one thing that other people
think it's awesome because you went to a

171
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:07,730
conference presented it sounded great
show your execution or the thing that

172
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,290
you build is just not attractive from a
sales perspective so I find in those

173
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,360
cases it's people who are too familiar
with their market their way down in the

174
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,380
trenches Missy indeed in the trench
where they can really build an

175
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,650
abstraction and ends up being attracted
to people have also seen a lot of

176
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,630
situations are people like we're gonna
be the first to market this is a new

177
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,470
market and that's like super dangerous
right there are a lot of companies that

178
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,300
were the first to market and the market
never materialized and they torched it

179
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,090
honey cash doing it so one of the
companies I used to work for was called

180
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:43,950
Fort Knox spelled NoCs not kmox that is
literally how you had answered the phone

181
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:52,910
and Fort Knox we try to build a payment
processing network nationwide credit

182
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,900
card processing network in the late
nineties that sounds like a really good

183
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,780
business model except for the fact that
we were pushing set mister electronic

184
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,970
transaction was the Visa MasterCard
smart card-based payment processing

185
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,570
system so imagine if you will

186
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,730
having to forward thought to think we
should have smart card-based credit

187
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:19,790
cards in order to prevent fraud in 1998
that would've been cool site that that

188
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,980
would I would have given you money for
that well at the time no one gave us

189
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,640
money so we took the founders money and
a bunch of VC money would go through

190
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,450
nationwide network we're the only people
on the planet with a functional set

191
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,850
infrastructure we start to finish we can
process the whole thing there were no

192
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,360
investors this is a brand new market
we're at the point of spirit it turns

193
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,310
out we were only 15 years too early for
it so the geologic time we were close

194
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:51,990
and in that time we were fairly far away
so beware entering new markets but we're

195
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,089
entering them to wait right because when
you need them to wait then you have to

196
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:59,050
play games and pricing and shit like
that better be like number two number

197
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,029
one kind of socks in this dangerous
number three and four have to run 2009

198
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,240
good number two is a good place to be

199
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,180
while you're trying to figure what the
market needs Gardner forrester other

200
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:14,029
analyst report super useful and super
expensive most of you probably don't

201
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,199
have your own personal Gardner accounts

202
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:20,819
put money on that I would encourage you
I had see people who know other people

203
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,800
with Gardner access be like a magnet to
pool reports about like everything

204
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,480
security oriented like that's asking a
lot that's been a pretty big which you

205
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,959
know hey man about your case of beer can
you pull this one report for me that's a

206
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,350
little bit more polite like and just to
be clear I've seen people asked like

207
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,180
four leeches on Gartner and Forrester
reports just honestly they're expensive

208
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,319
things be nice people like your friends
will help you out but you know within

209
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:50,850
within reason the last bullet that I
have your i think is as an important one

210
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,899
people like to have plans right
investors like to see business plans and

211
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,649
people get trepidations they don't have
a plan going forward you know gotta have

212
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:03,329
this is due in three months six months
in the year in eighteen months and this

213
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,790
industry changes really fast and when
you think your gonna do in eighteen

214
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,310
months helping out we're going to be
doing right so you need to have enough

215
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,110
of a plan to understand the basic factor
that you're on but you need to be not be

216
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,980
attached to nothing at some point inside
that was stupid and you go out and do

217
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,560
something else right you've got to be
prepared

218
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,439
you know it's like being a spy right
just dropped a plan to go

219
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:30,269
gonna go do something else in my life
now I tend to be on the side of not

220
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,870
planning on us that's falling asleep

221
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,700
falling asleep so I don't really drop in
on this one it's really will call this

222
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:45,950
is shitty talk I was
