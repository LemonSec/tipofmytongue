1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,630
macabre sharply up down up down left
right left by ABB ABB Ltd I had to be

2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,590
all remember that I wonder how many how
many people nowadays don't have any idea

3
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:36,489
what that does a reference to any I call
so callers when it is I'll pass out the

4
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:42,920
slides and other permits slideshares
something is occurring talk so you'll

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,570
see video of it elsewhere

6
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,840
Michael so I worked for up to the stock
is called losing battles winning wars

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,410
it's a reboot on active defense what's
going to happen is you realize that the

8
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:02,340
first chunk of this is actually while
much more basic than that but as a good

9
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,490
build-up coming here so bear with me a
little bit about me and my team our

10
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,450
group is chartered with creating
programs strategies or solutions R&D we

11
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,909
haven't applied R&D organization as well
which is all technical fields were sort

12
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,590
of a cross between what carter enforcer
do come by like a big for analyst firm

13
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:28,420
we create knowledge frameworks
organization so all the things that you

14
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:35,060
have in your rescue programs we help try
to organizations figure out asking the

15
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,310
right questions to get answers are even
more accurate so the background on what

16
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,340
what this is from understanding winning
losing and playing defensive long game

17
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:50,390
on the way you haven't had your redbull
or whatever they have here I encourage

18
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,119
you to do so

19
00:01:51,119 --> 00:02:00,850
research do a lot of talking to leading
world-class organizations on topic of

20
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,710
threat intelligence targets on those
things that everybody wants to do

21
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,920
my boss is described in high school it
was an expert but nobody's really gonna

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:18,520
rock high school right so we dropped
some data from industry experts minds

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,690
experts not experts in all the
difference in my memory so this comes

24
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,580
out essentially studying some are out 65
organizations talking we we had

25
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,180
conversations over thirty of the more
well-known industry experts on the topic

26
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:42,280
of intelligence and obviously some
providers so I want to start with a

27
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,910
basis for understanding what we talked
about winning and losing and security

28
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:53,780
conference that's heavily conference
seen as very heavily offensive focused

29
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,540
really interesting to think about what
does that mean from a security

30
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,090
perspective and I'll start with this is
really hard

31
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,069
non-defense understand security is
harder in any way it's done off ends

32
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:11,290
understands why people do defense a
securities hard and widgets really don't

33
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,110
help solve the problem we have met way
too many security organizations that

34
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:23,160
have more tools and a half people and
whether that's a good idea or not decide

35
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,049
on your own but if your ratio of
dashboards the humans anything over 122

36
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,680
you're you're doing it wrong but not the
tools that themselves into the problem

37
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,709
at the big chunk of the issues how
they're implemented how they're used any

38
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,620
time I had spent a lot of time studying
how security leadership functions of

39
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,590
people build programs and how people
structure their approach to any given

40
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,170
day and one of the things that is
consistently visible is that

41
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:59,959
when we are driven at a flame driven
right somebody says new shiny object we

42
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,870
all gravitate towards it has been our
say this year was a big topic this year

43
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:16,100
anyway now nobody knows actually saying
things like how the same thing but it's

44
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,109
realistically to be cloud security that
we went to the threat intelligence is a

45
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,609
big word and we're like

46
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:25,650
NextGen and pointing out that Italy
analytics I'll be something else but I

47
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,450
never believed something new to solve
some problems that we're not really sure

48
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,020
we have and so were generally really bad
at security and you can notice that

49
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,380
everywhere right security companies get
popped even those that are spying on

50
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,860
people in our actors get popped in
really really nasty ways so turns out

51
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,780
security people are also better security
as a shocker I think we will focus on

52
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,190
things that are super advanced to have a
tendency to forget all the things that

53
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,720
make great times right if I remember
correctly you never can but many Python

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,979
fans in house building a castle burned
outside a building castle on it it's not

55
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:15,090
working it's not going to work but I
think we feel absolutely miserable ya

56
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:21,010
doing security fundamentals and basics
and this is where it really kind of

57
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,650
pains me to say I want talk about the
defense but after defense means will

58
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:32,200
define at the minute we start asking the
question his ability I need a defensive

59
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,140
sides really interesting just think
about visibility of what you say you're

60
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,830
able to see on your network on your
applications in your systems and you

61
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:48,229
can't stop it you can't see a deer at 2
a.m. with your headlights off right now

62
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:50,340
nobody

63
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,930
when a South jokes like that hard to
stop what you can't see because you

64
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,750
don't know what it is right and it's
even worse is stopping you can even more

65
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,940
difficult to stop things that you can
understand that there's lots of examples

66
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,520
of this but we've all seen this picture
where somebody creates a really cool

67
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:19,500
idea any visible sorry so we we create
these grandiose extremely complex and by

68
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
the way when security key gets complex
that gets even more complicated when

69
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,290
we're so creative ideas of what we want
what we think we need to solve that we'd

70
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,650
create even more complex tools and
processes to solve them forget the

71
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,830
processes get more tools that's been
solved the problem think it's more

72
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,220
complicated by Howard Ulman got a
centrally in a wiring closet a server

73
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,130
room after like seven different people
have owned and operated that without

74
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,270
wiring closet and somebody says we have
a cable that's out right there's 300

75
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,470
places where cables are plugged in and
you generally have to sort of turned

76
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,460
into a fantastic can be done by just
about anybody and get something

77
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:08,120
interesting finding Hollen organization
is not hard I don't know if I ask this

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,280
question that I try to Pendleton found
nothing raise your hand right you always

79
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,080
fights so enterprise defense perspective
let me ask what is meant to fate was

80
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,760
immune to fail at security on the
defensive what does it mean to fill

81
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,820
answered not fixing stuff he found five
times and all that's actually a really

82
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:42,139
good but that's a good way to think
about it like I see that we're going

83
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,550
back two goals alright so let me let me
ask if a different perspective in this

84
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,150
may be a little better

85
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,970
organizations talk about and if you've
ever had to deal with upward directors

86
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,180
are a high-level management they say
things like we can't possibly be happy

87
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,080
camper the next story we can't have her
I don't ever have to

88
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,349
I don't ever want to write a press
release that's a good sign that says

89
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:17,310
your customer have lost your data sorry
may consider maybe maybe not so we set

90
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:24,659
our bar for secure for security and
goals unrealistically high technology in

91
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:29,189
in very very very succinct points here
as defenders is very there's three

92
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,120
things that you really have to start
thinking about and again we went through

93
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,630
and talk to budget he security
organizations that are various stages of

94
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,409
operational maturity by the three key
questions that actually a military

95
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:45,810
background you guys probably get this
faster anybody else is i three things

96
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,519
about his first one is do you control
the situation by the way these are

97
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,700
cumulative so do you control the
situation it's an interesting question

98
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,839
because in a lot of cases even if we're
not happy don't control the situation if

99
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,570
you've ever found out if you've ever
performed incident response that's

100
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,990
lasted 36 hours later realized that the
network that you're the big thing that

101
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,110
you're seeing is completely the jet
disturbing told you that costs connected

102
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,800
you know the deal organization that
happens all the time in a part of it

103
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,980
several times so do you control the
situation and it's a question so if not

104
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,519
then I would say you are failing with an
ING at the end of me you're getting the

105
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:35,120
next question is of critical assets but
now that's an interesting question I'm

106
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,079
you guys who here works on enterprise
side I'm you guys keep your hands up if

107
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,350
you know exactly if you can identify
your corporate critical assets lots of

108
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,870
hands went down at scary

109
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,490
so it's remember that thing I said about
really hard to defend what you

110
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,430
understand right you work for you gonna
get hired a company they say hey do all

111
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,360
the security things make sure nothing
it's nothing bad happens it's fantastic

112
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,140
it's like sending a five-year-old in the
playground and saying make sure nothing

113
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,980
bad happens to him I know how this works

114
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,970
you lose they'll find ways to hurt
themselves so if critical assets have an

115
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,660
actual trade by you first had to
identify them then I would say you are

116
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,320
feeling so this is two out of three were
still on the ING space we haven't failed

117
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,800
yet so it's another thing it's kind of
interesting is it a governance projects

118
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,550
if you've ever been a part of one I
salute you because you're still here and

119
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:43,089
you haven't quit but governs products
under unlike decades three-month hodgman

120
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,960
identify all the critical did in your
organization two years later as a

121
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,270
project on about 30 percent three
seasons later about 10 percent that

122
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:56,310
happen what turns out the other two
iraqi got new data now but it needs are

123
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,510
very fundamental questions how can you
tell of bad things are happening if you

124
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:06,370
can't find another one here last and
final is a situation recover a ball is

125
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:16,050
an interesting question when is the
block

126
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,040
ago you would be genetics fluctuated
something had to say that cool so what

127
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,890
are the interesting things I keep
hearing is and if you paid attention to

128
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,649
all these ridiculous ridiculous halfback
discussions over the place

129
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:31,940
one of the quotes you've probably seen
repeated over and over on Twitter cuz we

130
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,200
are pasted to each other is the quote by
somebody some general somewhere that

131
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,680
that would be a really good idea to say
things like well you might have to go

132
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,360
back and get our data off that server
networks somebody stole stuff they made

133
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,990
a copy now they have a copy from the
billion copies please you going to get

134
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,200
back isn't going to accomplish the
things you think is going to accomplish

135
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,029
so situations irrecoverable can you get
back to the state that you were out

136
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:03,910
before this bad thing happen if the
answer is no actually if you all three

137
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,980
of those if you're feeling feeling now
you can recover the new failed there's a

138
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,779
lot of things that have to fall in place
in order to you then let me give you

139
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,279
some thoughts for perspective so website
the faces happen all the time

140
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,890
a lot right that is that is one way of
looking at it

141
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,079
malware on your system so he does not
have a piece of malware and you are in

142
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:35,339
their network fliers distributed denial
of service attacks used to be that these

143
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:41,520
things were very childish pranks anybody
was on IRC long time ago understands

144
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,360
potsdam that word network sports and
stuff like that was a long time ago and

145
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,950
far away but it was fun and then be
tossed became one way to not be

146
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,140
competitors offline now it's countries

147
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,440
lobbying big globs of them against each
other and is fine but these are

148
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,070
inconvenience is in a lot of cases
versus what we think about installing

149
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,430
trade secrets and it's stolen trade
secret candy things like if you if you

150
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:14,090
either worked in or around the
pharmaceutical industry problems last 25

151
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:20,130
years I once you get a drug to market
and make your billions you spend the

152
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,210
billions to our India a lot of time and
effort that goes into it so the big

153
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,260
thing happening overseas in the Asian
market they say is thanks to McDonalds

154
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:38,310
kentucky fried chicken and fun fast food
places their population is expanding at

155
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,720
the waist that's that's the same thing
less healthy thought the rate of

156
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,350
diabetes shooting up so they can either
start from scratch where we were about

157
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,900
25 years ago or making find all the
pharmaceutical research companies that

158
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,510
are here in the USA really crappy
security and borrowed errors and guess

159
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,920
what was happening but they're not gonna
go twenty twenty-five years to save

160
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,020
lives so if you're in that industry
stolen trade secrets means that that

161
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,240
drug the you spend ten billion dollars
investing in its you think is gonna make

162
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,220
you a return of 200 billion over 25
years that's just evaporated that's

163
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,740
that's potentially

164
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,170
career and its business its debts real
impact to look at this from the

165
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,760
development the founder's perspective we
have to understand these things because

166
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,520
it to understand what's actually
important to ask him why it's important

167
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,180
to us if you're if you're under attack
side which i think many of you are if

168
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,950
you're on the attacks and is only one
thing that actually matters what is at 1

169
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:47,980
p.m.

170
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:56,960
right and she made an objective in
somebody's says go on that network

171
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,330
generally don't tell you that if it's an
actual thing something going on because

172
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:08,000
there's no purpose behind it but people
that are financially and scented either

173
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,270
through organized crime through nation
states they don't just get told hey go

174
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,360
to face this website they get told
here's a specific thing and C-dot

175
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,890
specific thing is the objective whatever
actions they perform that you to get out

176
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,680
of there so whether it's a classic
example is you know your quarterly

177
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,260
earnings as a public company get
announced Monday at 7:08 a.m. on CNBC or

178
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,750
CEO's gonna go out and be interviewed
will talk about it published a report

179
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,610
but until then because I reports done
about two weeks before until that

180
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,780
anybody that sees that the people inside
the company can do things like trade

181
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,080
against you or against your stock they
know how your company did so there are

182
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,650
people absolutely banging at your walk
out your door anywhere and everywhere

183
00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:00,860
else trying to get that report trying to
get at that data but that is only valid

184
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,860
until your CEO starts to speak it says
yes we had a great quarter or now we had

185
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,490
a kind of traffic was at that point it's
worth it as public data so if you don't

186
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,100
know if you understand what's important
and what's why somebody would want that

187
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,960
you can start building the fences that
actively defense defense budget makes us

188
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,970
eventually so if your adversary has
actually managed to achieve the action

189
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,230
against that objective guess what they
haven't won so I was like hey if you

190
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,420
haven't won it means I have I have to
write so they have them one of them use

191
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,610
a failed and so it turns out they're
actually socket security just don't

192
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:48,200
understand what we're doing and why and
this is actually a much better job of

193
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,579
most of us give ourselves on the
defensive side

194
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,360
can also give hearing however now
everything is easy to break every office

195
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,579
Vollmer Bowl nobody patches blah blah
blah but there's plenty of networks that

196
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:02,160
I can point to that there are riddled
with holes but only in places that don't

197
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,079
matter for anything so sure you gonna go
break into am you got a whole host of

198
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,829
service to go broke out but the best you
can do is hit something public and maybe

199
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,569
use them against somebody else or
whatever you're not getting anything

200
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,449
critical to understand whether critical
stuff so I think what if we look at this

201
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:26,389
as a as a focus it's possible to start
shifting away that security works and

202
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:31,389
the way we think and do we go from here
cause short game which is discreet is

203
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:37,350
discreet incidence and unfortunately
entirely too many security operations

204
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,769
organizations and hinson responders
thing short game industry given

205
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:45,460
incidence in fact some of the best
Tehran IR teams are down our

206
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,820
uncoordinated at the high level and
working the same incident from different

207
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:56,389
angles unfortunately and this is just a
fact so we're going to the stadium to

208
00:17:56,389 --> 00:18:00,450
login something about campaigns and
objectives because for various reasons

209
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:09,610
we have tools and we have the ability to
automate we've had that for years there

210
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,899
is absolutely no reason we should be
getting popeye things that are the women

211
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:18,279
of coated IOU's I would say by a 10 year
old that we have some really smart 10

212
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:24,580
year olds that doesn't work anymore that
are partly meant to be malicious sites

213
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,010
like about the defensive longings I
think we talked about here so first off

214
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:35,730
fundamentals I keep saying this over and
over and maybe one day sometime before I

215
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,429
retired but fundamentals are extremely
important nobody does them right

216
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:46,750
why because he's got a solid change
management process here how many guests

217
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,760
identify every asset on your network
person raising and how he works for

218
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,840
government entity

219
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:00,520
so other thing that I really really
don't understand is a blog posts lately

220
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,140
about just absolutely hate fried till I
get it I got pretty it's not sexy don't

221
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:12,120
get you on CNN but if you can't do
fundamentals way right like you can

222
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,159
identify your assets you know like this
you've got a set what's the

223
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,690
classification of that asset is it
important to the company is it not once

224
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:27,490
the configuration a little news flash
and the mission do this by Joe has real

225
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:33,039
big so guys remember hardly was not
longer right when you get when you heard

226
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,580
on the defensive side when he heard a
partly how many of you guys first thing

227
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:44,270
you did find a scanner and scan you know
her plea dear god why are simple

228
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:52,200
configuration and that's a problem
because you just wasted hours and hours

229
00:19:52,200 --> 00:20:14,110
of time you I know what you're saying
and your bill in in the organization's

230
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,960
ability to produce an accurate report on
what we have vulnerable now there's a

231
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,440
couple of really really well oiled
organizations that run really really

232
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,789
well and the first thing I did was what
they did was go into their asset

233
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:26,830
management tool

234
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:32,779
anything that had that was running an
SSL liberian an OpenSSL library when

235
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:36,230
looked at those that come even close

236
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:42,630
bought the known knowns were now able to
be addressed right not spending here so

237
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,399
we've got it doesn't there's an order of
operations here that we're just not very

238
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:50,659
good configuration management change
management traffic occasions you know

239
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:58,710
this all speaks to things like threat
model he does not enough hands

240
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,409
the founders of threat modeling revolves
goes right back to the basic point do

241
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:06,380
you know what you're aware your
weaknesses in our weaknesses will know

242
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,370
what the weaknesses are by figuring out
what's at a camel what's high-value

243
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:15,330
unfortunate high-value so that it
becomes really boring everything's

244
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:23,380
important things like the levels of
everything is awesome so look i say one

245
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,409
of the one of the most most sad things
that we don't know are on battlefields

246
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:35,490
and I i might be choppered to keep
saying this over and over and it's just

247
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,750
repeating that is work too many are
cases where if you want to get accurate

248
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:48,460
map of the network they look to the dump
that the bad guys made this does not

249
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,289
bode well for defenders just ask
yourself mentally how old the network

250
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:59,690
map is in your menu of your organization
if the were at the word years is

251
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:05,169
creeping in your mind this is not good
right so I think you got some home ice

252
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:11,190
advantage of a black artist and deal
with a hockey fan here you understand

253
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,399
home ice advantage during the board's
behave differently when he slammed the

254
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:19,950
puck against them different cities we
had the puck against the boards it

255
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,169
springs back in a moment just hits and
flops and dies there so you gotta know

256
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:29,720
as a person chasing the puck how it's
gonna behave gotta know that it's your

257
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,110
network you need to know why there are
pockets of this particular type going

258
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,590
from here to here that those should be
there should not be there because quite

259
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,809
frankly defending the unknowns on
possible again you can't defend you can

260
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:48,080
protect what you don't understand you
can't defend what you don't see don't

261
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,760
know so step one unfortunately of any
good active n strategist Matthew your

262
00:22:52,760 --> 00:23:00,120
own damn space right now this is I will
simply caution you by saying I tried

263
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,580
this once and and and I'll spare you the
details but I

264
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,610
as a long time ago and there's a VMX
left VMs fax machine it doesn't like to

265
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,380
be touched by an apple just leave it at
that

266
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:22,720
so you can really crater some big things
that make this when you actively mapping

267
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,930
your space is really really important so
collecting data in building baselines

268
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:36,170
anybody here actually built some
baselines of their network and so this

269
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,730
means out of somebody's already on your
box scanning the other machines in your

270
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,290
network you'll never know gee I know
that's normal not feeling which is great

271
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:49,970
except for that that would be ok if you
have a hundred 28 K

272
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,560
network line in your in your network but
we're all talking about multiple

273
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,890
gigabits out of time here so if you give
me back it seems that fast as I could

274
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:05,420
talk you didn't build some baselines
primarily because we want threat

275
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,390
intelligence this is generally where I
think most people want to apply it

276
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,100
they've actually feel that the other
things they don't know what their

277
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,390
network looks like you don't know what
the rules are users are don't know

278
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:22,390
whether critical assets are actually no
no idea how change control works in our

279
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:33,490
answer clearly is gonna get some a good
friend Jordan stuff right I've done this

280
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:33,799
once

281
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:40,869
doesn't work while the meeting but I
think we need I think we need some of

282
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:45,619
that using that word do not think it
means what you think it means people

283
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:52,669
interchange threat intelligence with
threat data intelligence what behind

284
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:58,259
data so we have data on knowledge
intelligence was like yeah just give me

285
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:03,080
like a humongous IP a feed of bad idea
dresses that threaten target settled

286
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,039
I'll save me possibly you could have a
slight chance of doing that so

287
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,710
intelligent incorporating externalities
really important I think it is but it's

288
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,749
the whole intelligently incorporating
stuff Rights Award and is not

289
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:22,350
necessarily good anybody had the
wonderful job of watching a seven-year

290
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,230
responsible for the health and safety of
the seven great so you can you know that

291
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:34,710
they're kind of picky a tender love
humongous amounts of data generally are

292
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:40,340
not so much data is not necessarily good
so think about it this way so if

293
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,330
somebody hands you $10,000 IP addresses
as in most of the US Centers of the

294
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:50,159
commercial data feeds back if I would
give you 10,000 10,000 bad IP addresses

295
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,029
right now I would be dead to you on a
regular basis

296
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:56,759
question number one is where you going
to put that if your answer is the same

297
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:02,919
you've said the wrong answer generally
speaking

298
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:09,619
here's why it's not even like where
you're putting in one of the other but

299
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:16,919
what do you do with see the whole point
of Colleges defeated active defense like

300
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,840
a which means actually doing something
about the things that are being thrown

301
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,230
at you silly to duck right more
effectively and if you don't know where

302
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,129
to put the data and you've got a much
harder question on your hands and this

303
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:33,340
is where unfortunately a lot of time
your tools become an adversary

304
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:38,220
and I said this comment earlier give you
your debt ratio of dashboards the people

305
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,510
is anywhere near 121 or higher

306
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,030
turn some of her stuff or just plain
autopilot mode focus on one or two of

307
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:50,580
them it's a challenge that a lot of us
face because over the years we walk into

308
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,740
an organization where they bought stuff
bought stuff bought stuff bought stock

309
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,730
in somebody's gotta and their seventh
escorts yelling at you about this some

310
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,800
in supercritical things happening right
now which one you go figure out what to

311
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:14,520
do with yourself become our adversaries
for reasons that I think you guys get

312
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:21,030
but were closed as well are people burn
hot like crazy when we just make them

313
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:28,690
are $200 a week so I'm asking him or
just a question of those of you that

314
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:37,960
that do some work how many alerts have
you received $100,000

315
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:48,630
question 33 I can deal with three users
to possible and the reasons for this one

316
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:55,810
you don't see anything or to your really
really good at security network

317
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:01,460
segmentation finally but how many hours
to BBC per day and there's a cycle are

318
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,100
you

319
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,580
comes in you do some triage make a
decision ultimately that's the role the

320
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:16,280
event analyst in this life cycle so in
an eight hour shift those of you that

321
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:23,540
know this answer up hard in an hour show
how many events can analyze process I am

322
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:29,180
gonna get venture a guess five

323
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:45,240
not answer so in an average in our shift
the numbers are between 2432 which means

324
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:53,730
15 to 20 minutes on average for an event
to pop up you go do some basic analysis

325
00:28:53,730 --> 00:29:00,160
of time joie realize it takes about that
time blood but that much time to log in

326
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,820
to investigate so what does an alert
that says hey you're being injected

327
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,310
right you're stealing someone's stealing
lots of data from you

328
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:13,790
ok let's go and check out that system
check out the source to destination see

329
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:19,340
whether it's important or not right
takes about 15 20 minutes now 32 is not

330
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:26,820
a lot considering that some of these
dashboards produce upwards of $10,000

331
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:36,220
today so not only do you drowning
incidents but if a bad guy and testing

332
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:44,010
somebody who's like why don't you random
things anything I can think of and then

333
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:49,330
the signal gets completely lost it
happens every day and the answer to that

334
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,000
is obviously junior so that's not as
easy as it sounds

335
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,730
we tried you can probably knock it down
her magnitude but tell you really

336
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,470
understand what's critical that's not
where you're important segments are

337
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:11,070
where they're not exercise completely
fooled so it is a little faster and it's

338
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,640
true

339
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,960
stopping in focusing a supercritical
figuring out what threats a relevancy

340
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,550
this this this is a recurring theme you
what's important what trucks are

341
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,850
important is predicated on what's
actually important in your organization

342
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,510
because threats against non relevant
things are really threats are noises see

343
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,509
there's this

344
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:41,809
eventually get out there but there's a
tendency to use to create formulas

345
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:46,449
insecurity to understand how people
quantify things like risk and one of the

346
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:52,579
my least favorite is this notion have
impact has probability of me know the

347
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:59,239
law small numbers as recently explained
this by somebody who agreed so it turns

348
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:03,099
out that if you have something humongous
impact the release of all probability

349
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:10,409
the answer to that if you multiply left
like most of us would is wrong because

350
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:19,539
to use an important situation defensive
911 really really small probability the

351
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:23,699
impact not so much so in that case the
risk technically would have been really

352
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:33,139
really low so we've we fall down to that
so figuring out what threats irrelevant

353
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:40,349
things like impacting like volume things
like value those are important and I

354
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:44,289
think one of the things we continue to
struggle with is everybody's system is

355
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:48,529
on my mouth hurts I'm just Fassa if
you've got an hour but you were you

356
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:53,509
claim you got no malware on your systems
are looking hard enough we're not

357
00:31:53,509 --> 00:32:00,869
looking at all and sometimes as an
adversary in there somewhere so we did a

358
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:05,039
little digging it turns out that there's
technically three types of different

359
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:13,769
threats to the third with a transitional
state so I'll get news do you have a

360
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:18,949
little discussion chime in here so just
three different types of threats they're

361
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:26,209
they're basically differentiation
basically differentiated by the type of

362
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:32,770
targeting and a pipe of persistence so

363
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:43,250
they are generic target appropriately
named generic threats are no longer do

364
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,200
spot these things that have infected
millions of people are not targeted at

365
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,570
you generally nobody specifically
highlighting them to do anything

366
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,450
specific it's just threats

367
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:03,190
annoyances now there's no targeting is
no intent to persistence which means

368
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:12,550
that these viruses which is interesting
because we have the stuff which I was

369
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:21,340
told in early 2012 solve this problem by
now so logical next question is will

370
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,970
then why the hell and I our team
spending upwards of eighty percent of

371
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:31,100
their time I that's a little bit of a
tough question asked the next eight next

372
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,470
type of threat is targeting targeted
means somebody's taking something

373
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,930
generic made a small tweak repurposed
theory pre-packaged it and pushed it

374
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,780
over to you now I say you I like you
generically so they're targeting

375
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:50,660
pharmaceuticals are targeting banking
talking something not used specifically

376
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,710
right so when you get down to this its
yesterday bit of targeting there's no

377
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,370
thoughts on persistence is the
proverbial splashing yes that jewelry

378
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,190
stores a lot of diamonds in it as dr.
pickup truck into the plate glass window

379
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:11,770
got as much as we can take off the comp
show then we get to persistent and this

380
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:16,669
is where you are both the target you not
target of opportunity for you are

381
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:23,330
specifically targeted individual you
fear being targeted and there's a visit

382
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:30,200
to the notion of persistence so in a lot
of these in his two previous cases but

383
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,520
you're not really getting 02 expended on
let's face it nobody's

384
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,110
willing to lose any of their secret
attacks sauce on you when your swing

385
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:46,550
enemies that's what they are threats of
this type generally somebody is taking

386
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,429
the time to write to do on a recon on
your network they know what network

387
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:57,140
protecting network any malware appliance
you have to know what you running just

388
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,520
top they know what they can and can't
get away with sending you over you mail

389
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,040
denote generally which people in your
network the most gullible and all them

390
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,330
and we'll send you something work push
you something that they know has a very

391
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:16,350
low probability being detected very high
probably affect low friction hi outcome

392
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:22,480
and it's generally intended to be used
for you which means that the time they

393
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,880
spent time on it it's not something you
gonna give up easily in terms of trade

394
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:33,810
craft right so they'd like to keep the
tools they use secret so i reset it but

395
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:38,540
the breakdown in terms of how much time
you guys are spending from the IR

396
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:46,010
perspective on this is roughly 80% on
the generic threat roughly 19% on the

397
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,850
targeting in about 1% of persisted
because by time you get through the

398
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:55,480
eighty percent and you're getting to the
harder to get out of the EZ Lube getting

399
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:01,750
to the harder to simply by sheer volume
and workload because nobody ever gets to

400
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,680
the point where they're finding things
at the signatures are telling us are

401
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:11,150
there doesn't have that kind of guy was
actually really briefly backwards so

402
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:17,170
we're extremely backwards on and whether
you've got the capabilities and I was

403
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,140
almost irrelevant you're spending your
time closing tickets and our person

404
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,430
that's not general direction you want to
go so why does this matter at all

405
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,580
well I think it does because there's
vastly different types of her spots here

406
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,610
from an IR perspective there's three
different types of responses were so

407
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:38,330
that the defense stuff comes in and
again make it clear up hiking anybody

408
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,820
we're trying to make sure the position
we're not building a fence Magna line

409
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:50,420
again as friends but they asked for this
is vastly different responses here in a

410
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,800
generic type of such a scenario where
you've got stuff that just shows up

411
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,990
that's all there is no went and it
doesn't matter if it's on your system

412
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:05,260
its wreaking havoc new Kings now call if
you are not a meter spots but that

413
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,570
doesn't mean reimage the machine every
time anybody else tried to do that alone

414
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,310
will understand and agree with the fact
that that's a very short life expectancy

415
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:17,900
net job by the third or fourth time
you've been somebody's machine that day

416
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:23,440
he probably in different kind of phone
call right so you remedy machines

417
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,150
doesn't it does but to a degree so how
do you do that we have these things

418
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:37,490
called tool if you don't have anything
on your voice we all have stuff and

419
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:44,490
hopefully as well managed asset
management but they should be taking

420
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:49,610
this burn out from us right destroy the
re-imagined however you wanna do it

421
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:53,630
again i kind of caution you get to
imagine that destroyed the thing that's

422
00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:01,730
causing havoc near zero human time
expended is expected outcome here from

423
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:07,300
my you very well and IR program it would
spend determined it was a level 1 year 1

424
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:17,190
threat up to find out a lot of time
after five minutes so you have to be

425
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,450
able to identify

426
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:25,430
identify what type of threat that if you
can you don't know where to focus

427
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,410
response so you spend actually some time
doing things like containment analysis

428
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,750
and destruction so contain it

429
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:38,290
figure out for stock market however way
you want to keep it from spreading

430
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,570
itself making other bad things

431
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:45,410
analyzed it right you're not just
talking it but the analysis actually

432
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,840
help you determine whether the thing is
generic or are persistent the target is

433
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,490
her like a transitional state for many
are folks

434
00:38:53,490 --> 00:39:01,190
we do minimal human time expended here
15 minutes probably watching the

435
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:06,730
terminals adhered to throughout up to 15
minutes a timeline and then we get there

436
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:13,200
we actually have time for the persistent
threats and these are the ones that get

437
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,890
that should be getting our attention we
should be getting giving these detention

438
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,890
because there's no signatures for these
nothing automated in terms of virus

439
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:31,550
signatures is gonna tell us that hey do
something so contain analyzer to recover

440
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,610
as much longer

441
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:40,420
containing it analyzing it removing it
and recovery part of recovery is going

442
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,210
to be things like evidence preservation
if you found something an hour that

443
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:49,140
matches his category odds are going to
be an investigation into custody

444
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,260
thinking about how does that actually
work

445
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:57,010
one of the unfortunate thing that
happens a lot is those of you that

446
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:03,200
mentality and and the cycle of just
duking machines you and you end up

447
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,540
realizing that the FBI shows up asking
for evidence that you destroyed it

448
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:14,720
conversation you spend the necessary
human time that you have to on these

449
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,460
types of that is exactly means however
long it takes

450
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,790
now it depends on whether you do with
executive and user so use better

451
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,120
judgment but it's the however long it
takes to actually solve the problem

452
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,990
because now we know the perpetually
playing chess against somebody that's

453
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:37,150
also thinking the same way we are they
want and we want them out we'll kick

454
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,690
them out to come back we'll get them out
again they come back to find different

455
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,840
ways so this this is a just begs the
question is how do you actually tell the

456
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,870
difference so I think this is where we
start getting the utility out of things

457
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:54,930
like threat intelligence agency atomic
indicators that we have need context in

458
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,480
the gold really becomes intelligent
prioritization that's where active

459
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,250
defense makes us you take the threats
you get from the outside

460
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,480
combining with internal data that you
have things you already know model that

461
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,380
your real tight and then you can start
doing intelligent prioritization just

462
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,350
this is this thing relevant I get that
everybody in the world says this is the

463
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:22,560
oMG bad panda that's going to you know
how called things in my network

464
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,940
even matter to me oh by the way they're
targeting the pharmaceutical industry

465
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:33,060
the bank probably don't want to have a
Sunni you know how those things

466
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,960
beforehand with some relative certainty
so what's opportunistic malware and

467
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,250
what's an adversary these are big big
differences and we all feed this

468
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,740
intelligent processing plant looks like
this

469
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:55,600
11 steps back you probably can't see any
colors read what's up there and so on

470
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,680
the left hand side

471
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,350
acquisition in secondary development
you've got triage initial collaboration

472
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:08,290
and Richmond distribution execution
feedback management governance strategy

473
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:14,350
that's how this thing works to process
the new individual so you start with

474
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,110
some external indicators

475
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,140
brought it to the loop you end up with
secondary indicators things that don't

476
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,060
come out on the outside yes thank you

477
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,020
enriching it with external internal
external content has an internal and

478
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,690
external content is a very important
things distributing execute because you

479
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,480
need to get intelligence into a place
where can actually be acted upon

480
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:43,150
otherwise its data sitting someplace and
you ask the question of can you learn

481
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,780
from the incident can you get better at
doing what you do as a result of

482
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,620
something can you improve from and how
we could start actually chasing through

483
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:59,070
that Lupin start looking at things that
are important and how do we respond to

484
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:04,310
them in a horny bastard I think that's
how you figure out how to win right

485
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,510
couple of goals here raise the cost of
the adversary know you're never going to

486
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:13,170
be able to outspend the nation state or
a wealthy you know somebody with a ton

487
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:17,240
of oil money that's determined across
your bank off the internet you'll be

488
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,550
able to outspend them but you can sure
try and you can do things that

489
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:28,070
strategically raise their costs and like
all criminals like any enterprise it's a

490
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:32,550
criminal enterprises to that were
enterprise there eventually the cost

491
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:38,870
benefit scale those in the wrong
direction they got screwed by Tommy how

492
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,130
often does that happen to have good that
for this frustrating the adversaries

493
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,180
also recall if you've ever seen anybody
that's got a really good hunt team are

494
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,340
really well oiled security organization
somebody will pop there now we're

495
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:56,090
getting a final notice the pattern
project system as a whole the coming

496
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,490
again

497
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:00,120
ok come out to come back in again though
kick him out but every time they come

498
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,840
back they're forcing him to try
something different right ok at first

499
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:10,070
you're looking at SLA patches right to
suffer 2008 alright fine without me

500
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,480
close all those in the course of the
trial fishing educate people on fishing

501
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,950
every URL detection great number sending
attaches we figure out that I can only

502
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:24,400
find a zero DS systems now you're really
upping the ante

503
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,859
and now they're burning tools and
writing code to get into your stuff

504
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:34,990
that's really hard core studies are
really try and lastly the ultimate goal

505
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:39,319
is to keep them from achieving their
objectives like that seen with the CEO

506
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:44,589
data and in critical assets have a shelf
life generally speaking they have an

507
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:48,329
expiration time it would become viable
anymore they're not important anymore

508
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:54,460
and if you can stave off the attack and
tell them you've won so destructing

509
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,849
effort to achieve objectives and repeat
as necessary and I think about the

510
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:02,460
things that we do this is how we define
real security active defense really is

511
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,079
all about it cuz that is where we
actually but our security tools and

512
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,420
offensive spark people to work to stop
the bad guys are real bad guys not the

513
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,640
things you know that accidentally hit us
from getting the things that are

514
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,859
important to us as a lot of stuff that
we're not doing anyway so we have a lot

515
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:30,829
of the Enterprise Rent audience from our
game is interested in email.com happy to

516
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:39,750
answer them and that's a sign on the
caller
