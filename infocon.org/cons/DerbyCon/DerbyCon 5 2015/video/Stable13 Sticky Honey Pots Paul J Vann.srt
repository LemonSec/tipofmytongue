1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,410
I'm ready

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,599
my name's Paul van and I'm going to be
talking about honey pots how they work

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:20,550
what they can be used for and honey 50
and all that so this is my first off so

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:29,429
I hope you enjoy a little bit up so
first a little bit about 93 student in

5
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,270
Virginia near the dc-area and governors
school which is basically a program for

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:43,440
smart advance people and demands on 13
years old twin sister that amid all the

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:53,210
media makes fun of me for every day I
skipped 7th 8th grade last year and I'm

8
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,210
very interested in ethical hacking
computer security matter physics thing

9
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,539
about possibly starting a green one of
these fields I take online classes that

10
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:16,729
idea how I am familiar with some Python
JavaScript and HTML so anyway I don't do

11
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,590
research and I kind of made my own
definition for it and I think that honey

12
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,810
pot is when Peter on the DMZ that is
used a trick the bad guy into thinking

13
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,640
real data exist on the system and also
helped us and help people acquire the

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,470
bad guys

15
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,840
information so that we can track the who
what when where this can be used to

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,680
determine metrics and find out who what
how many people would scan or how many

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:52,100
of you would go in to the Father I know
that Butler is being the food for

18
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,210
Halloween and I just want to let you
know don't get stuck in the shop like

19
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,380
this

20
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:10,690
so how anybody's fault anybody has seen
more ability testing is the you in

21
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,099
finding unpatched cherry halls and
company or a computer from a company and

22
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,160
it can help you protect on potential
attackers are hackers and protect from

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,819
people trying to get your system
trapping it can help create traps people

24
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:31,709
attackers in your system and tracks
their banking all black and metrics and

25
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,500
help the gathering gate I can find
attackers IP addresses again find all

26
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,880
kinds of information about them and
that's one of the main goals of the

27
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:49,200
high-powered rifles where can they be
used

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,459
they can be used for vulnerability
testing for private companies government

29
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,120
agencies police departments in the
military

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,239
these this is important because if you
are a company or your party company you

31
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,349
don't want to allow people to break into
can be used to protect your system and

32
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,440
find places where people could break in

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,700
wow so now the good stuff

34
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:21,400
the honeypot that I have money but I've
been working on is I've been using a QR

35
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,650
code linked to a fake government site to
trip the bad guy or a attacker into

36
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,410
thinking they found some import which is
good because if you can captivate actor

37
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,650
in its young more likely chance of
finding and blacking their data will be

38
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,440
able to capture a Nike just geolocation
insights delivered as well as the names

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,310
and passwords they tried in the logon

40
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,989
here's our it all starts off with the
simple desktop allowing RTP nez easily

41
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,739
get a password

42
00:03:54,739 --> 00:04:00,500
there's a folder titled cop company
private files on his desktop which also

43
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,329
was the Captivate min to go to a QR code

44
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,870
the bad guy in to make them feel like
they have made a good fine and that the

45
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,830
company made a mistake when really it's
just trying to find the vulnerability

46
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:21,220
and possibly capture the attackers data
so here's an example of the Windows box

47
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,310
I used private files right there and
that's what they would attack would see

48
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,480
its official machine online and then
that would be the start of what they

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:41,730
would click then once once they have
opened up this file is a QR code which

50
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,270
is meant to be cuz its you don't know
what's in a QR code into your scan it so

51
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,650
the captain see what's inside of it they
were open into the QR code and then

52
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,400
again the reason I chose a QR code is
because I want to see how many people

53
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:02,090
actually scared with their phone as well
for matching 401 scan the QR code

54
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,200
believed to have a government agency
login for which the attack had no idea

55
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,620
they were going to because it's easy I
can't see the link until they've

56
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:26,030
actually gone in scan the QR code here's
an example right now fake government

57
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,800
will import this is the day I built with
error code with HTML to to make make it

58
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,720
to hackers will try and attackers were
trying to break into the system so when

59
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,690
the QR code leads the private logon
quarterly tackle against your captivated

60
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,700
trying hacked the libretto by attempting
all about passwords the global be ready

61
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,800
in israel to send me an email when the
summit white distressed by the tax bill

62
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,400
just tell me when someone should tell me
someone tried to log in and send me

63
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,320
their username and password that they
tried to login with this all there will

64
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,600
also be a packet capture on EMI network
to capture information the attackers

65
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,760
Wireshark as the packet capture and this
is meant when they log in to take go and

66
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,669
take a grab some of their data show that
can be used in law enforcement and can

67
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:18,020
be used just a capture the data like IP
address here is the website I coded

68
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,040
there is a fake government welcomed

69
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,960
I say and when it is plugged in

70
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,980
whatever's in the box will send me
what's in the box and it will also show

71
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,330
me how many people have actually
actually tempted to go in and how many

72
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,280
people are actually actually close
enough to act to click it and not know

73
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,370
the honey pot and then here's the here's
just the website again with the code but

74
00:06:45,370 --> 00:07:01,190
there's more I just couldn't sleep so I
want to find out how many people will

75
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,590
actually try to go into any RTP and how
many people are well actually going to

76
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,050
need for the folder and how many people
will show you our code and also find out

77
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,780
how many people will actually put in the
username and password to login portal

78
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:20,350
and I want again I want to see off our
someone will go to the 10th to access

79
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,430
the system I created and it forced the
nazis computer but also their phone but

80
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,650
should also give me full IP addresses
are both on the phone and computer and

81
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:41,710
I'm really interested in intelligence so
who when where the honey pot with setup

82
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:49,970
externally for one week in August the
number of RDP attempts were 13,000

83
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:56,810
number of successful RDP loggins 8700
the number of times qR codes can was

84
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:05,200
6304 other number of attempts to log off
a total of 5,500 and that was the end I

85
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,100
found that out by the number of emails
received and then the number of

86
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,860
different countries was 23 and the
obvious ones are China and Russia and

87
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,560
then there are 0 successful login to the
portal especially if there's no real

88
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,840
username or password

89
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:30,710
so who can benefit from the private
business law enforcement government

90
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,630
you're basically everyone with long four
horsemen government agencies they can

91
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,339
use to capture data of different actors
in the people trying to break into these

92
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,990
systems and then private businesses and
basically everyone can use it to protect

93
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,560
their data their IP address and all that

94
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:57,600
by catching up security holes they have
in their system

95
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,730
summary of that hot chick bad guys and
help prevent attacks against real data

96
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,770
iPod can get tricky if the proper traps
are set up they can use to track metrics

97
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:20,380
benefits exist for all types of
businesses and then what's next

98
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,660
this is faced its first in line to
provide a disclaimer to cover myself

99
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,209
legally and face too is a tackle back
against the people who are trying

100
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:36,320
breaking the system so it was have his
gamertag cover myself legally I can now

101
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,279
using getting out on going to attack get
back against the bad guy

102
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,490
the person who tried to it attack and
then I'll use Java other embedded

103
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,730
mechanisms to attack back so I can
gather more data for law enforcement

104
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,880
purposes and I can just in general
graphs gathered their data as they tried

105
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,010
to gather mine

106
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:20,440
this is my contact info on my Twitter
and email and then any questions

107
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:37,190
Charles password yes it was it was meant
to be a simple password so that people

108
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:45,240
can easily break into it though there
was there was no password that exists in

109
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:58,450
2009 I'm 39 tonight

110
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:10,480
yes I looked at some of them but night
looking I mean it was a long list

111
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:45,500
obviously I go back to 5,500 I didn't
see any but probably yes yes yeah I mean

112
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,380
it was all over those are the ones I saw
but there are definitely like there's

113
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:56,010
only knows a lot more but all in all
over Europe and Asia and places like

114
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,660
that is just a variety of different
countries and places they were questions

115
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:11,920
it was running at my house

116
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:30,170
yes it took about 10 days probably be as
well known to go to the website was

117
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,840
about two or three days and then to
actually build the inversion urged to

118
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:52,430
get the rich machine and end up to
around three or four days anymore

119
00:12:52,430 --> 00:13:11,790
yes I think I followed a honeypot was
and I started researching it more and I

120
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,360
had known how to code a lot of my team
out so I decided to build the NSA login

121
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,840
portal first and then I found and I got
virtual machine and put it all in and

122
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,100
wrote the comfort to send me e-mail with
the usernames and passwords and gather

123
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:40,430
all that data in a few years ago are to
a couple years ago and then I just

124
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:53,820
gradually built up

125
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,500
attack back obviously that's what I want
to our ability I want a delicious of

126
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,180
that tax back but I went down so where
it's harder to break in

127
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,450
so there's less people breaking in which
it has less people less deal actually

128
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,510
can get in and what the less people I
plan to attack back against those people

129
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:33,200
anymore

130
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:49,280
they got a lot to an end to do to
contribute to all the projects I want to

131
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,280
probably why I want to apply for a
talking mood this year so that

132
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:05,350
especially since I live right near there
but probably now and I'll go to you is

133
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,710
that all
