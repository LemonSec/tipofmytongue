1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,340
good afternoon everybody my name is
Patrick McNeil and I'm unregistered 436

2
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,119
on Twitter I'm a Solutions Architect for
radware fell fifteen years of telecom

3
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,020
experience least half of that insecurity
welcome to the phony pony freaks plays

4
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:40,260
the way so I'm on Twitter on Linux blog
site out doing development work done

5
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,090
develop sysadmin stuff but I don't like
gonna break and stuff more than building

6
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:54,399
it moves in pen testing red teaming so
as make so we're planning on putting the

7
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,610
other talk for Derby Conn we figured we
needed to come up with some sort of

8
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:05,460
Derby related maybe so we found that
there was a horse racing term called a

9
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,610
pony in the pony is a pony that leads
all the thoroughbreds to the line before

10
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,450
the start of a race and we thought there
was an allergy there where the old

11
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,140
school freaks were really the ones that
led to a lot of other phone enthusiasts

12
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,270
to explore the phone system and they
were really the first hackers coax

13
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,540
people into exploring personal computers
on the first her to come out eventually

14
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,659
coaxed the phone company in the sticks
in their problems and we did some

15
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,560
research and found out that hair title
was actually a real thing or some other

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,070
slang terms associated with pony pony
but I'm scared definition was actually

17
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:51,630
in 1904 this guy named Henry Hayes
proposed putting fake ponies on the

18
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,909
front of cars because the the the horses
that were on the road at the same time

19
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,549
as the automobiles were getting scared
so he figured this would be one way to

20
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:03,050
not scare them I actually giving them

21
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:11,070
course decided to calm down its team was
functional but it was very entertaining

22
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,320
thongs what kind of checking out in
Louisville Kentucky area stumbled across

23
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:23,850
to me at least I guess Louisville out on
the Baxter Avenue makes ninety percent

24
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,360
of this product so in the us- I've lost
50 is anyone know what it is like not

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:45,640
something you would think so yeah yeah
it was with this is Dave's reaction was

26
00:02:45,640 --> 00:03:02,370
Dave Kennedy dancing and this is what
this is what Google came up with

27
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:15,480
it is really good so it will be a brief
history of time systems of evolution

28
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,239
gonna go over attacking defense each of
those categories and the two we've been

29
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,970
working on and we've done some set
integration which would be up online now

30
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:36,430
you can grab it so first the mandatory
disclaimers a regional bullets but yeah

31
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,069
this is our own views and opinions we
don't represent anybody else

32
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:47,930
alright so before users we're actually
allowed to tout phone numbers they had

33
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,780
to rely on operators and the operators
pick up the phone and you would tell

34
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,650
them change you wanted and the number
you want to be connected to there were

35
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,349
no buttons or anything on the phone so
the operator would make that connection

36
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,269
for you

37
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,160
user dialing where you can actually
dollar owners came from a fairly

38
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,599
unlikely source there was a guy named L
stroker who was an undertaker and he

39
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,090
felt that his business was being stolen
because suddenly kind of way down he

40
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:26,190
found out that when his competitors
wives was actually an operator so you

41
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,470
figure whose routing calls over when
somebody says I need the Undertaker to

42
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,930
his competitor so being in a sense of
comic guy he came up with his own

43
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,590
switching mechanism something called the
stronger switch and use alternating

44
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:50,240
current pulses to rotated dial and at
the time his exchange had three digit

45
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,360
number so he came up with three separate
rotary switches and it was one for the

46
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,889
hundreds place on the tense place

47
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,020
and one for the ones place and there
were three months to process the

48
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:12,870
individual buttons repeatedly so if
you're 987 it was nine times and so it's

49
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:21,759
a very so but it worked and he
eventually ended up selling that you or

50
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,770
so they came out with an alternate
version of it and has implemented by

51
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,490
them they included the rotary dial that
we were familiar with however in order

52
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,490
to take operators out of the equation so
you get one exchange to another they had

53
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,659
to have a mechanism for you to replace
that name of the exchange with number

54
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:52,050
and that's how they ended up developing
the team that we know of now where you

55
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,379
had the ABC actual digits the
abbreviated exchanged names and then you

56
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:12,199
would exchange numbers so nothing
changes without a motivating event and

57
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:19,979
AT&T not only wanted to you know make it
easier for users to dial but they wanted

58
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:25,319
to save money so their motivation was to
create efficiencies in their growing

59
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:32,979
network but also to limit size their
workforce so the panel and crossbar

60
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:39,120
electronic switching system was really
the first example of the switching

61
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,949
system that they developed to replace
operators and not have to tie up as many

62
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:51,500
strippers which so they were able to
build up the numbers that were dialed in

63
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,039
some centres and then send that to the
switch which would then signal to the

64
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,810
network connections to make you didn't
need all the store switches that that

65
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,509
covered global change dialing but it
didn't handle long distance so they

66
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:10,590
eventually develop the

67
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:16,400
for a that using metal parts and metal
parts represented routes from one

68
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:24,520
exchange to another in the head back up
routes so one run and workout they pick

69
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:31,530
the next that finally took operators out
of the equation styling and they had to

70
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,110
adapt somewhere to be changed to
exchange dialing they had to adapt the

71
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:41,930
daily scheme so that you know one city
to the next and that's how we ended up

72
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:50,560
with three digit area code now what they
had intended was their fatal flaw trying

73
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,180
to use electrical pulses to see those
electrical pulses came all the way

74
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:03,450
across right so they introduced multi
for your first it was a single frequency

75
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:10,430
and then later a multi-frequency told
that signal problems which to switch and

76
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,210
unfortunately through listening to the
connections that were made when when he

77
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:24,040
figured out that they used a 2600 tone
which was the Supervisory told they

78
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,720
could trip to switch into thinking that
they had hung out and then they could

79
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:37,170
actually signal so from the perspective
of the phone company you know they call

80
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:44,130
was torn down in this new call it was
coming in was not able to get onto the

81
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,520
future of void because you've got to
take a look into the future what could

82
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,330
happen is is pretty safe statements ASAP
as is around to stay not going to go

83
00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:00,050
anywhere this cool stuff coming out some
good innovations and VoIP web RTC click

84
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:06,540
call or upcoming maybe as resistance
against Tonga was see more people using

85
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,940
voice of course like 20 people were
gonna call you and give you a pin for

86
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,740
one-time possible this Google

87
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:22,500
into the future too much so you're going
to show you any early days or anything

88
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,940
we will cover some attack vectors still
affecting the need to be defended

89
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:33,910
against and we show is simple vector
which is free to all the Carolina and we

90
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:43,250
can talk about Astor's Kirby is sure
you're all familiar with pastors that is

91
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,580
created in 1992 read the slides on the
books ton of information out that too

92
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,520
interesting things I am i na GI ami is
the ostrich management interface and the

93
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,940
AGI is the gateway interface which is
kind of like you'll see GI of Astor's

94
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,230
get those everything some in some way or
another may not do well in December

95
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:11,209
decor stuff like handle calls Makos next
to a database so long that you have one

96
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:19,630
of these custom distributions the bill
on top of it every days but you know

97
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,770
when you are building something until
something to make it easier and you're

98
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,940
not doing notice or just setting
permissions running everything is really

99
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,250
you know it's not always going to be
secure say then silly you might break up

100
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:42,579
the scuffle yes we're going to attack
was since we're going to cover some

101
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:48,420
threats and high-level go over attack
but I also wanted to injuries measure of

102
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:57,589
distance because you're always nice
things and so we're going to cover some

103
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:00,480
some threats but certainly not
everything is we could be up here

104
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:09,730
basically all the rights of the first
one is information leakage and we're

105
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,000
gonna give you a perspective of the
freaks history versus today obviously

106
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,170
you know using a system for something
that wasn't designed for

107
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:26,670
you know stop their reveals the usage
station or you know how to access this

108
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:33,360
information you may not want somebody
else to have so that the freaks

109
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,579
there was all kinds of information
available to them because people hadn't

110
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:41,500
really considered security when the
phone system was designed you know

111
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,949
freaks were the first real enthusiasts
like to explore the phone system not

112
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:50,130
necessarily various and they took
advantage of information leakage all

113
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,720
over some of them with social engineer
operators to connecting calls for mostly

114
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,540
the operators are called inward
operators they're the ones that made the

115
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,720
long distance calls some of them would
ask their girlfriends to impersonate an

116
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,889
operator operator is it time operators
were pretty much all women phone company

117
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:16,740
had tried to use teenage boys and found
it that's what I backfired because

118
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:23,589
surprisingly had attitudes when
connecting customers and women you know

119
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,130
if you could get a girlfriend to do it
for you

120
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:30,810
they were more believable they also
talked to phone technicians because they

121
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,350
were the only phone system around and
phone text really proud to work for that

122
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:40,029
company so how does this thing where
many do this without the engine so they

123
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:46,449
give information and then of course the
in-band clicks and tones were there for

124
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,430
anybody listen to so good you're likely

125
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:55,380
different different meats and stuff
today you still hear those days

126
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:04,040
tones on actual Dalton now different
stages but they could have told that

127
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,750
down

128
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,790
engineered so so people use tape
recorders you know they'd actually take

129
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,220
that and they displace the tape together
replay it just listen to it figure out

130
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,610
how to do it with tone generator and
that's basically the evolution of the

131
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,000
first blue boxes just tone generator

132
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,110
so they could generate the 2600 tone and
then send the single or multiple tones

133
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,550
down the line to $2 next number they
want it we don't really know of any

134
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,480
defining moment when there was like the
first guy who figured it out because

135
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,440
they're all kinds of different stories
of people figuring out about the same

136
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:48,290
time it was much earlier than many of us
think was 53 54 timeframe it really one

137
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:54,560
of the first test cases of this was
Charlie pine Tony Lau can add ross at

138
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:05,070
MIT Harvard and MIT and Harvard how they
met up but really they did the Harvard

139
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,750
guys were involved in radio station the
MIT guy was an electronics engineer and

140
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,740
went well as placing a team together I
can build you a box of the same thing

141
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,490
came up first tone generator but they
became notice because they were were

142
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,120
dialing essentially and they dialed in
air force base so therefore space calls

143
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,020
the FBI and he gets involved they're
thinking their spies and they're

144
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:38,860
detained and they find out they're just
making phone calls for mine and they

145
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,560
figured out there not spies there were
no such thing is you know phone fraud

146
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,780
charges back then it was no law against
it and so the phone company eventually

147
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,910
gave freaks even more information and
gave them a gift which was the 1960

148
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,610
issue of those systems technical
journals picture there and you know they

149
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,030
were proud of their own accomplishments
so essentially they published the exact

150
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,720
multi-frequency tones ever used to
seeing from one exchange that the other

151
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,640
two single calls to the basics basically
gave him the plans for Mubarak's hazier

152
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,750
gonna sing all calls from its own
generators this is exactly the frequency

153
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:27,150
of that sort of trying to figure it out
so we can also dial exhaustively besides

154
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,570
just dialing phone numbers to find
interesting numbers they

155
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:37,420
did unusual prefixes different route
includes basically ways to force calls

156
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,230
to route in the directions that they
wanted them to know one of those numbers

157
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,310
number types they found was called a
loop around it essentially it was a

158
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:53,130
diagnostic tool that guy in the field
use to connect one line to another but

159
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,590
they figured out that these were free to
doll and you get to people together

160
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:04,060
without paying for that call dial the
number was like a one on one call

161
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,720
small-scale party line and then
eventually they were underground papers

162
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,770
are published that had the plans for
blue boxes essentially does stick it to

163
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,460
the man

164
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,080
AT&T in the federal government is we had
a federally subsidized tell you at that

165
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:29,390
point you know make sure it's now the
wider world was never really aware of

166
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:35,680
own freaking until 1971 and this esquire
article came out called secrets of the

167
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,680
little blue box and essentially it
introduced the world to the these guys

168
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,380
doing Gracia Martore and John Draper and
you know they certainly were flown first

169
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:56,980
phone freaks but they became some of the
more well-known in ones and you know the

170
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,400
phone company sorry to respond to the
blue box saying that was going on by

171
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,189
introducing a night of dancing when
methods are they essentially put modems

172
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:14,650
in that would signal from one exchange
the other so called common channel

173
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,000
signaling so essentially once they
started rolling this out

174
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,140
boxing started to go downhill and freaks
could still

175
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,550
box from from some exchanges but not all
of them

176
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,280
and they start looking for other things
a mess around with so some freak started

177
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,980
transitioning to be asses and you know
if the modems can be used to connect

178
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,730
offices we can use them to other
computers personal computers came out

179
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:50,220
and it was just a natural so many freaks
became the first hackers from from

180
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,300
history perspective this is like barely
scratching the surface so I definitely

181
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:02,620
recommend exploding the phone by still
absolutely right so far from an hour

182
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,320
days perspective you know it's just as
easy if not easier to get information

183
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,070
about phone system because a lot of
people are connecting actress boxes and

184
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,660
enterprise systems you can get one of
these on the grey market you can

185
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,460
download a virtual machine of asterisks
in service around with it you can scan

186
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,210
the internet and find him certainly with
you got your own port scan it and see

187
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,410
what's open what's coming in that
release new SIP stack you know you're

188
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,030
pretty if you figure out what
proprietary headers they're using

189
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,710
extension of numeration we are rolling
through a quick test message to multiple

190
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:47,290
extensions to figure out which ones are
actually there to be cracked in just

191
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:52,130
listening to voicemail props like okay
that's the default did your recordings

192
00:18:52,130 --> 00:19:02,040
were so kind of kind of profile help
from the city is a lot like HTTP if

193
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,280
anyone is familiar with that this is
likely said as most common VoIP protocol

194
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,230
its the the signaling component that
establishes calls and in the part of

195
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:20,200
blue is session description protocol
it's what negotiates real-time protocol

196
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,070
or that their path audio or video that's
going to be seen as part of what was

197
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,960
signaled by set of course because it's
text-based just like a GDP

198
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,320
you can man in the middle of this mess
around with it at will

199
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:42,190
you can get him in the middle position
and of course if authentication is still

200
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:50,470
using this all dead and 35 indication
mechanism so it's it's been somewhat

201
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,520
secured by the use of TLS and SRTP but
you know encryptions heart so there's

202
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,539
not a whole lot of people that have
actually deploy TLS and SRTP even for

203
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:05,510
public calls over the Internet or
they've done it sort of halfway yeah

204
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,049
they've got to less but no STP so it's
still not secure or they're still doing

205
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:16,710
service ID Authentication only in not
deploying hindsight's so that's great

206
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,440
but I'm not really adequate security
wise just to become management's hope we

207
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:29,990
don't want to do that so from the from
the aggressor side if you're going to go

208
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,289
after somebody a lot of this is a basic
stuff you doing a pen test to the Google

209
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:39,860
searches first look at job words call
the company and all the voicemail and

210
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,679
identify what they're running from their
their problems if their

211
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,260
internet-connected cinema quick sip
options message if you can find their

212
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,830
their call server and maybe if that
doesn't work

213
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,010
invite message and see what the
supporters are they come back because a

214
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:01,700
lot of vendors have dietary headers so
you can identify with that sort of I'll

215
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,080
call me and injured 11 30 bus and I know
exactly what's up

216
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,000
ex-police enumerated user extensions or
just sending an invite to every possible

217
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,320
number that you think might be on their
their their system and in many cases the

218
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,010
website will show you the five digit or
four-digit extensions of all the

219
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,080
employees there so you are using it for
five digits keen to see that's real

220
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,059
quick skin

221
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:40,409
said once you know what they're running
quick will need of a skin from an

222
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:46,279
information gathering perspective you
know port scans definitely but obviously

223
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:52,220
running slow and you have to specify the
port ranges to pick up stuff like eg I N

224
00:21:52,220 --> 00:22:00,179
map released by default doesn't matter 8
a.m. i gon doesn't doesn't pick up mir

225
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:07,289
AGI there there's a bunch of six
scanning tools as well on backtracking

226
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:11,840
charlie but some of them you know
there's already signatures for them so

227
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,669
if you're using the default email right
away so you have to go in and change

228
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:22,990
stuff like user-agent values use
multiple tools 22 maybe chance somebody

229
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:28,110
who's got a signature for one but not
the other skin with alternative methods

230
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,499
most of the tools we use an options
method but you can tweak its use in by

231
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:36,249
canceled or something else to get them
to actually show that they're there

232
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:42,259
because options messages are are
filtered out the menace police scanners

233
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:47,169
actually pretty good it won't help you
with torrential cracking as much but the

234
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:53,029
ministry scare randomized every single
feel messages so you can't necessarily

235
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:59,840
build a signature and I'm a big
supporter for both liberal a blue box in

236
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,230
G know that readers and they're they're
both actively maintained tool so

237
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,659
definitely check those two-out yes as an
exercise actually you did all the work

238
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:12,740
on this you too busy metadata

239
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:19,299
needed some good analysis correspondent
with Twitter cleans Daniel brew in

240
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:24,720
Australia and he helped me with plastic
surgeon portable the data and went

241
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,549
through some reason stuff for the most
part we found we expected a whole bunch

242
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,590
Astra systems out there

243
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,880
lots of all an insecure and gays and
crap that could be really really easily

244
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:44,110
the stuff that totally blew my mind was
an actual DMS 100 which that's like a

245
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:51,400
pig iron Tokyo switch up to 1.2 million
lines that when was it like Brazil or

246
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:58,970
something but you know that and a lot of
our way in I ran in a lot of cameras

247
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:07,880
China crazy so from a defensive
perspective I think it's fun to change

248
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,370
your city usery's because every EPABX on
the plants will return the user-agent

249
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:20,179
value that says I'm an asterisk or I
mean social manager 6.1 ever you can

250
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:24,149
change that so you report something
that's totally different different

251
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:28,730
software to the east and now you're
attackers are going to be maybe slightly

252
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,200
stymie they're gonna maybe maybe maybe
maybe not really know through doing not

253
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:41,039
block bad user agents in use rate
limiting we have tables on our get up

254
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,820
that actually has a hole through a bad
moon user agents I collected over three

255
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:54,750
years of supplying pop research and
you're always reject to your Asterisk

256
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,330
and fix a basically if somebody's trying
to numerate

257
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,669
extensions are available they're gonna
get the same response is it they send an

258
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,700
invalid password so they're always going
to get the same here

259
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,419
message they don't know if the
extensions or not whether the

260
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:15,370
authenticator is not so it's hard to
tell what's going on definitely using

261
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,429
Delta banned kach scanners and you have
the budget

262
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:26,899
US uses three appliance has signatures
were set and will do all this greasy

263
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:31,019
don't necessarily have to mess with Bill

264
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:36,350
really need a an explanation for
exploitation basically exploiting so

265
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,389
selfish purposes or to gain access to
something else

266
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:47,230
used to exist in the phone system for
the vaunted Sheena they may use it to

267
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:53,539
enable further exploration people think
that they were malicious that most of

268
00:25:53,539 --> 00:26:01,429
them probably probably innocent right
maybe I know nowadays you know every

269
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:06,409
like the wild wild west anybody's going
to explain anything they can whatever we

270
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:14,850
can get rodeos botnets then to the Expo
is against us know buzzwords their apt

271
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:21,070
trixbox is we were talking about earlier
since the popular front end asterisks

272
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:26,480
you can't downloaded put-up abuse
overworking PBX has some really good

273
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,619
features and its quality software as you
can tell since it's five starts last

274
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:37,059
updated 2013 and they were close to like
almost four thousand of those that

275
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:41,799
showed up at that really slow yet
whereas the exposed like in front of

276
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:45,899
that is in his teammates and not
including the ones behind it

277
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:50,950
yeah there's a ton of Honor Roll Jesus
is up just up to 2013 I guess they

278
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,480
stopped counting maybe I don't know what
happened but there's pretty much

279
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,320
something in every category

280
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,490
we've got some demos of some of them I
didn't write these tax terrorist first

281
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,509
couple of yes not the first couple

282
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:11,450
the elephant on the fence David exercise
we just probable pop-up box of the

283
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:17,879
cookie nothing crazy this is the
standard access point out that like we

284
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:22,720
were talking about sit and stuff but the
admin interfaces that he's covering like

285
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,460
a lot of these we didn't correlate

286
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,100
open web interface to how many heads of
interfaces open but this is very very

287
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:37,330
common that a small business setup yet
but this one is enough in case you don't

288
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,090
have to log into an exercise which is
cool

289
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:47,520
malware or whatever exploitation with
the local file inclusion it just so

290
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,620
happens that they had a local file
inclusion this is authenticated see you

291
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,539
have to be logged in as admin

292
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:58,870
I don't remember which section of it was
what what kind of access you can go

293
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:05,279
ahead and read files on the system you
can't read like pro FDA or PHP input

294
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,159
which is kind of a bummer so you can get
remote execution from that but you can

295
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,149
worry just the way the web interface
looks you can read

296
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:21,010
UTC such as quick as you sip comedies
your extensions all of that the AM poses

297
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:25,480
a great one that's got to database
password and you can read Esther slopes

298
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,940
which which is kinda cold chaining yes
pretty much everything on remote code

299
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:40,940
execution we said you can't do by PHP or
on the focus group the state doesn't

300
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:48,820
matter because there's this one you just
do a record institution we have a quick

301
00:28:48,820 --> 00:29:04,470
10-0 super simple this is important to
exploit super simple to fix to

302
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:20,520
Michelle localhost Mr Cameron

303
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:37,429
get back to the terminal because I
forgot to stop this is the monkeys

304
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:52,940
alright so that was cool but even if
those of us didn't exist in its just the

305
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:59,299
LFI we can inject SIP message with a
paler than it and then use Delphi to

306
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:09,640
read the Oscars logs so we got a demo of
that to display that did not play play

307
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:22,429
play baseball

308
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:44,909
read something and then she is gonna
read the estrous logs which is super

309
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:52,039
cool just to be able to read some
disastrous logos and then we'll send the

310
00:30:52,039 --> 00:31:05,980
test message was just test you can guess
it shows up so what happens if you have

311
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:21,379
some PHP code and the city is one of
prepared alia the priest p.m. and there

312
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:27,809
is so yeah you could inject any
malicious code you wanted that's cool

313
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:33,889
you can use as you wish so don't check
your Astra slugs yeah that's why people

314
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:38,799
try and just randomly inject random
stuff into any locally because you could

315
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,840
eventually exploit something of a chance
to open it with notepad or something so

316
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,590
this one as the school but they still
get to see this one is one they changed

317
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,409
over three of those together or the
exercise on offense gave it and the

318
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:59,149
remote code execution 22 of him and he
just kind of the palos going along the

319
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:06,490
bay 64 encodes and redirects to win
their location and so basically you want

320
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,409
to send this dish to an administrator's
somebody who has access they they did

321
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:14,720
some kind of ACLs ok only allow people
in in my local network to happen in my

322
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,820
life

323
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:22,190
text books you could use that to send it
to my friend and it is pretty confusing

324
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:32,860
get along we go on and get the tab and I
have to personally so this is the

325
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:39,180
payload forever to get it working
properly or something so simple but it

326
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:46,780
replaces the window location was shall
we say that's showing that this is an

327
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:56,260
unauthenticated session as a file is
this could mention it serves as a

328
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:10,290
LinkedIn session just clicks super
important for other against see what's

329
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:22,670
going on and is your shelves that we put
in the route so you get to the fence

330
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,850
gate it doesn't make sense to rate
yourself within have to a fence gate to

331
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:40,850
get to it so that's nice said placing it
on any expectation defense like I said

332
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:46,850
this is the best way of doing it in
small to at least this is one way of

333
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:55,880
doing it just sanitizer in for free of
these is one things so defending against

334
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,590
everything as a whole is kind of
difficult is is hard you can only use

335
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,670
some common sense and avoid the wooden
one distributions just being there was

336
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:11,260
such a pain because you think one of
them you can't even though they did

337
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,970
because it just breaks all the
dependencies you stop cryin over

338
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:20,040
judicially the trixbox is a lot of these
are deployed on Lake purpose built

339
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,470
appliances

340
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,599
they saw them to small businesses and
you are small business owner you really

341
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,340
have the expertise of great that if you
do then you bring dependencies in

342
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,070
support nightmare this is easy don't
upgrade

343
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:40,020
he's yet to build is else don't build
what you don't need and you won't have

344
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,770
to consider it same with consideration
it sees run across something you don't

345
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,109
know what is what is needed you begin
you don't need it

346
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:56,740
use a file photo blog bad people BS
things that have things like remote root

347
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:06,660
for a cessation my secret police next
category fraud and abuse

348
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,530
basically using a service with no
intention to pay causing loss or damage

349
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:18,040
generally enabling criminals to make a
profit and maybe in some cases no

350
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,530
relation to the telephone network to do
something on intended for fun it's still

351
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:29,930
fraught but you know so the most common
scheme for telephony fraud today is

352
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:35,150
international revenue sharing fraud
there's a fraud and market according to

353
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:40,089
the communications fraud control
associations reporting like 2013 which

354
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:45,750
occurred when I do it today it's an 80
billion dollar industry and the FBI

355
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,619
actually added a couple of fraudsters
their top 10 siren will spawn it

356
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:56,830
essentially you take over a PBX bunch of
traffic and you split the profit with

357
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:02,430
somebody in a foreign country country
has who served no affiliation with USC

358
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,570
law enforcement so it's pretty easy to
make money in nobody's gonna come after

359
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,550
you your PBX kid used to make calls

360
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:17,130
forward incoming calls and in many cases
you'll see stuff like voice mail system

361
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,450
is compromised

362
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:28,240
just yet it's called high cost us
nations the next one week alrighty

363
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,130
spoofing may be more of a social
engineering back here but you can also

364
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:38,750
use it to buy a house somewhere small
that occasion but we get it at the next

365
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,830
slider to still need to host service is
another vector that's been growing where

366
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:49,770
you're basically making which it calls
towards a target usually somebody's

367
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:57,560
running the scheme like extortion or
maybe protest or prank what you call

368
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,950
someone and say we're unless you give us
this money we're gonna take your phone

369
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:08,250
no pressure could be served if you give
us $50 we're gonna move in next hour and

370
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:16,340
fishing is definitely increased over the
last from my perspective anyways a lot

371
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,880
of robo dials going on we're all
familiar with the lake Windows support

372
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,980
calls that come in and the calls you get
it in the morning this is your credit

373
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,740
card company you you've been a victim of
fraud enter your credit card number now

374
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:41,880
they're collecting that information is
all just a lot of people talk about

375
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,570
facing Karunanidhi and it's a bit of a
misnomer people are really referring to

376
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:54,920
the name display in many cases you can
take the number that it the from number

377
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,990
but you can't necessarily shake the name
is displayed because that is actually

378
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:05,420
resolved using a database did buy your
phone companies so the person who's

379
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,830
making the call isn't sending that name
is resolved by your company they make it

380
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:14,500
dipped out to a public database retrieve
that name and then that's what they

381
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,720
display so if you own the number you can
submit

382
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,950
the name you want displayed but in many
cases phone companies will say will show

383
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,109
us approval that's really you

384
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:33,390
photoID doing business as some sort of
the public documentation that will let

385
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:40,230
you do that but not everybody checks
that there are some providers that you

386
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:47,070
can you concerned sorry a sort of
skipped so many providers will also save

387
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:51,890
your making your call out on a SIP trunk
you also have to send all your dia

388
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,599
number going out so we know this is the
number of people call you on this the

389
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,150
only number you're allowed to make calls
from there are some providers that will

390
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:07,200
allow you to spoof that outgoing number
to send anything you want to like it is

391
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,190
it is valid

392
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,970
has valid uses for an outsourced call
center that makes calls on behalf of

393
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:19,430
lots of people but we can have fun with
that the truth in Colerain be act of

394
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:26,230
2009 basically says it is illegal to
spoof numbers if there is intent to harm

395
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:32,250
so in our case we can have fun with it
within certain parameters but yeah we

396
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:38,510
decide to change our caller ID investors
once you find found that provided that

397
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,420
will let you do this which could be
tricky maybe not as pretty easy you can

398
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,790
do it probably more places into these
are two ways we use it extensions to

399
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:53,390
accomplish this is set like beautiful
corner ATL bound and then cool already

400
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:59,940
in your court file super simple just
change it and so as a quick demo of that

401
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:06,880
he look who's calling

402
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,980
just going through the phone book or
white pages dot com define David Kennedy

403
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,839
punching a couple numbers when they were
we thought about calling the hotel with

404
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:22,809
a cooler AC that I canceled my room
three or four of the conference rooms

405
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:31,029
that might be a malicious intent so we
kind of felt Carolina come go this idea

406
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:36,130
of like we were messing around 70 table
just sending random caller ID's as an

407
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:41,890
interesting ones who went back and forth
seeing what signs result well which IDs

408
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:46,859
so what if you got a call from your
voicemail if you move your voice mail

409
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:51,589
carriers voicemail number would show up
voicemail and turns out it does your

410
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:56,480
corporate voicemail number calling your
cell phone or something so we may start

411
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,890
working on a project which basically a
fishing tour now that runs on time he s

412
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,470
actually an asterisk AGI

413
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:11,809
these are some of the other use cases we
came up with the morning been quiet for

414
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:16,630
new textbook fast-track somebody'd
suggested doing liked it

415
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:22,440
donation campaign or something there to
see haven't signed up for the corporate

416
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:29,349
giving please please insert your credit
card and so we made an ideal for you

417
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:35,470
done and you can configure everything
for it already set targets you select

418
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:39,250
one of the recordings he previously
uploaded and then you get a quick

419
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:45,099
exploit new hang up and dial everybody
on that list so that's cool in this case

420
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:55,690
it would be cool or ed to voicemail for
this one's treat me why not you

421
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:03,170
she turned to many times do I S phone
number

422
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:26,050
record those tons of fun but not get his
ass to lose its kind of campy yearly

423
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:31,220
setting this up using your phone so you
could really set up a very large dialing

424
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:36,420
campaign without without going insane so
this is just the log files only a

425
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,500
teammate of reporting menu but we need
to talk to them about you in the

426
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:47,910
far-flung areas is interesting in all
schools but we had some discussion at

427
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:53,720
DEFCON after his talk and went to the
telex party after the course other phone

428
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:00,550
enthusiasts like Kobe you could do this
so a manageable to do it all for further

429
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:06,130
as I made arrests in place for us when
faced with the HP slim framework for

430
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:11,530
whatever reason I used the HPV sits on
the same machine as disastrous over the

431
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,460
running for the project and basically
controls everything that the idea that

432
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:22,329
makes it a lot easier like this is an
example of how to exploit specifying

433
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:26,970
accordion the bomb sits almost
everything we still gonna put your

434
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:36,619
supervisors number in their username a
possible future to provide a safe and

435
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:41,079
other brain waves was to make a cell
module

436
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:47,859
bring it back to the social engineering
toolkit and you put in there was any

437
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:53,300
accesses the REST API configure stuff
for you and then lied to exploits

438
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,950
basically you run it

439
00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:00,640
press free for the motors and then do
that so this this is online

440
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,350
the third time

441
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:10,380
to the shop in this today so basically
here started to settle it go in the

442
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:17,180
third party modules and then option one
to set up your server URL that one work

443
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:25,010
by the way if you try to hit you can
authenticate users use a GPS if you want

444
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:30,840
to basically go in and look to see what
targets we have set up his case we had

445
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,380
done so we're entering in my burger you
don't even need to decode the BBC winter

446
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:51,340
tire dialing campaign person in this
case it was a disco number and with it

447
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:57,280
the default recording for calls use all
be posted on our set up by the way if

448
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,900
you're having trouble following and if
you're familiar with said louise is

449
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:06,630
pretty pretty easy to do this and right
now it's one number eight times might

450
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:13,400
begin but I've got plans to have its
board as CSV file so now it's making a

451
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,820
call the background to my brother phone
answer the call and I'm clinching in

452
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:33,050
five ones the goal then go to reporting
on the scene to bust out of there to

453
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:40,230
reporting you can see a bunch of calls
that were made the digits are collected

454
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:46,820
but one of the bottom is the one that
just got so if you set up a time numbers

455
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,340
you could see the ones that came back
with him once they came back with

456
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,520
nothing like the ones that weren't
answered even my voice miller et so this

457
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:59,060
is what it looks like when it comes to
be really loud

458
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:07,240
your functions in a different place
which you didn't hear is it please enter

459
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,750
your password but I couldn't get this
fast enough and that's the 51 so it's

460
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,860
not very thrilling but he came in with
the right number in actually was results

461
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:25,070
disco because the Nexus 500 501 or
something actually tries to do some

462
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:31,790
color eighty stuff so that's cool you
gonna do some stuff to kind of expand

463
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:36,520
this mostly on the exploitation side the
rest interfaces can actually be able to

464
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:42,560
configure everything from all the
exercise even if it's a provider of for

465
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,410
this evening at the Masters Concord
configuration files you need a

466
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:52,400
multi-step when you outsource it is not
just hanging up on you sorry you did

467
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,370
their own please injury that it might be
a little tricky all of these features

468
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,730
different color ideas of different
numbers if you find out different

469
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:08,830
provided you need to use a different
color 80% better reporting possibly a

470
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:12,710
mobile app on the web app so you don't
have to you said if you don't want to

471
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:22,870
you do any other way we can show you are
using her cell phones plans will have

472
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:30,130
actually made it easy to deploy so this
case started this is the corporate jobs

473
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,060
create a vision system

474
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:37,550
phone system towards test uses you can
expand the REST API have been expanding

475
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:47,140
it had it not in capability season get
your recording and do it and I did a

476
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,330
deployment

477
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:55,220
a parade with statements to install
vagrant and then the books and just talk

478
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:01,220
later in up downloads everything from
get into those which sits there today

479
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,390
download the bigger machine bigger and
up

480
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:12,069
in completely configure Ascaris freaked
me the web so you know you need from

481
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:17,819
there is a truck and your IP address in
place but there is not really good

482
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:22,339
documentation that should be I should
write that song list is on the list

483
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:29,089
semi-automatic documentation is pretty
easy to use from reading so so so any

484
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:33,799
ideas coming totally running out of time
but why do we care about this because if

485
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:39,359
we collect that information now we got
your voicemail 10 we can make calls we

486
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:46,079
can collect things that might be able to
get us past you no password challenge is

487
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,250
that things like that from a distance
perspective obviously educate your users

488
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:55,970
that they shouldn't be punching in
numbers for incoming calls that are

489
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:00,930
asking for their voicemail painfully
obvious but using some of the caller ID

490
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,920
spoofing you can make it sort of looked
pretty real you know if we'll need stuff

491
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,069
like her dental cracking if you're
connected internet block international

492
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:14,289
destinations and be aware that there are
many international destinations in the

493
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:18,740
Caribbean that look like they're in the
North American numbering plan they look

494
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:24,490
like regular 10 digit number but they're
not tend to dial around is missed by

495
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:28,769
alot of administrators on their data
plan that allows you to select an

496
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:29,940
alternative

497
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,970
long distance carrier by that call
forwarding should probably be disabled

498
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:43,869
really not very much anymore don't allow
voicemail system to dial out

499
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:49,769
the next talk to your provider lot of
them have broad protections but if you

500
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:54,759
don't sign up for them even though it's
not seems expensive you're you're liable

501
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:59,900
you can generate as much as $90,000 a
minute as a fraudster from one

502
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:06,710
compromised PBS very very simple very
quick put pins on long distance trunks

503
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:13,390
do stuff like actually it was meant to
lessen SRT correctly and if you don't

504
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:17,749
want to maintain certificates for every
individual user fees to issue a single

505
00:50:17,749 --> 00:50:22,690
organizational certificate that you can
put on every single home that allow for

506
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:26,559
mutual authentication and if somebody
tries to crack credentials it's a lot

507
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:35,490
more difficult and it will mean a fraud
system is you have the title funny so

508
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:39,299
all right that is it thank you very much
