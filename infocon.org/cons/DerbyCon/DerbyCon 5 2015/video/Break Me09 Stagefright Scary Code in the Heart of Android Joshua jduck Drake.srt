1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,549
exactly exactly I feel that pain it's
like I'm here too we got a sort of a

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:13,690
problem will technical difficulty j.t
obviously I must speak right now is like

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:19,310
Jadakiss opposed to be up on stage and
his little nervous trying out and I mean

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,500
you might want to help him because I
think he's got a really bad case of

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,939
stage fright so you can give a good
round of applause and try to get them up

6
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:32,320
there that'd be awesome

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,070
Jada

8
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:59,960
thank you I didn't set up a date not set
up to do that job I'm hoping I fare

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,330
better than some of us have so far

10
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:17,860
work I don't get it the window I was
using totally disappeared not sure

11
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:35,680
they're not that one try that one again

12
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,140
do this way

13
00:01:39,140 --> 00:02:05,630
yeah they want her there that too but I
wanted

14
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:13,640
it's like you have this Jan resolution
display you probably want them to be

15
00:02:13,640 --> 00:03:10,320
your external 108 that's nice I can't
see anything

16
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:51,260
rated as one of me to disappear

17
00:03:51,260 --> 00:04:02,260
yeah I got a hole like menu bar to go
away I swear I presented this before in

18
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:26,630
the same problem try this year though
it's alright so shall I think you guys

19
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:34,539
all know you're in the student's
introduction my name is Josh Drake or

20
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:40,610
agenda at least I go by Jade on the
internet this little bit about me then

21
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,110
we'll research for a long time

22
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,620
first following another switch
directions and paving some of my own

23
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:55,590
path was Imperium and we wrote this book
me in five other guys called andrew

24
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,919
hacker's handbook you haven't seen that
check it out and I founded to drive

25
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:07,419
stick research group a few years ago
that's a good every day so the

26
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:13,349
motivation for this research number one
I wanted to improve the overall series

27
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:19,289
of mobile right like if you like 90
people are doing that at least a day

28
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:24,680
when I started this increase visibility
of risk going and rewrite there's tons

29
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,460
of coated Android it's ridiculous why
not point to code is particularly bad

30
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:41,130
so and I wanted to put the droid army to
good use for those of you who don't know

31
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,270
what to droid army is a cancer that is a
cluster of Android devices always on

32
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:57,160
connected to USB commands all then we
could do it on my phone after this round

33
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,460
buttons so sponsors this work were
obviously superior my work now I but

34
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,389
also opted before that you were talking
about when I worked there so they were

35
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:11,570
immensely supportive when I was doing
research

36
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,650
it this this is a rare case where the
research that represented here are

37
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:28,630
multiple jobs and a lot of credit
designed differently stood on the

38
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:35,090
shoulders of giants and had some fun
with those guys as well of course you

39
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,789
see me keep going like this to these
slides are too early it's because of the

40
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,800
like this presentation for a more like
the right hair looks like next section

41
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,080
so what are stage right does anybody
know what stage fright is at this point

42
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:58,849
what is taking regular well that was
kinda I don't think that I could take

43
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:05,190
credit for that this is an underage meet
multimedia framework so many like sort

44
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,699
of thing with audio or video it goes
through this librarians in Android and

45
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,160
it's been that way since quite

46
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,220
you can see down here in like dan dan
kaminsky says like that moment when the

47
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,630
name of your product is literally worse
than anything and come up with for for

48
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:30,710
the vote so brief history like Android
originally launched back in the day

49
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,370
after being completely closed for a very
long time after acquisition with a

50
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,300
library called open door somewhere along
the way around 2.0 timeframe for Android

51
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,890
they started developing the seller
library called stage for a they had an

52
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:52,730
optional and 22 and 23 and later it's
been to fall so 23 I'm not sure how many

53
00:07:52,730 --> 00:08:04,560
underage daily basis it's like almost
everyone I got an iPhone now so beware

54
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:13,190
not because of this work just you know
it's also used by Firefox and Firefox OS

55
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,010
they randomly decided for some reason to
pull out of a hundred and throw into

56
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,450
Firefox you know it's funny to his own
reporting bugs to them and they were

57
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,920
like yeah we really wanted to prove this
code and I was like why don't you just

58
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,880
do it so they use it on OSX and Windows
in the use it on a great in Firefox they

59
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,200
do not use it to use like GStreamer
which I don't know maybe it's bad I'm

60
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,650
sure right now jumping all over the
places terrible so why let's start with

61
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,889
the name of the library stage fright
what the fuck

62
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:57,319
directories respond to what stage for
its weird who would do that you know

63
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:02,889
guys have codified show people what
you're trying to say so

64
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:11,169
also its exposure to multiple victories
it's like yeah that's pretty cool talk a

65
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:15,709
little bit more later about the media
scanner the media scanner is basically

66
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:20,999
like aggressive AV styles gain all the
things especially the ones that are

67
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:30,259
entrusted Gary its binary notes written
in C++ so you know there's a lot of

68
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,919
potential for mistakes they're not only
that but the file from a trabajar in

69
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:41,769
meeting their complicated numbers in the
area gotta be very careful so even worse

70
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:47,669
like if you go look for Android crashing
over time you'll find like people

71
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:53,540
talking about yeah I like my battery is
really bad and I look at logcat it's

72
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,549
like just spewing crashing every time
it's reading some file so that that's

73
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:07,720
kind of like you know it's that's the
one I had both eyes and then there's

74
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,439
really two publications recently so I'm
certainly not the electricity produced

75
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:21,209
these guys this is the one from Intel ok
so the guys didn't talk in April at the

76
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,279
end road builders summit facing the
media from working

77
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,529
it was great talk they released their
own father's so you can tell they run

78
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:36,230
their father want to and they say in
their talk today submitted 11 terabytes

79
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,290
of media files to the internet security
team I'm not quite sure how you do that

80
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:47,350
but they did that and I was like that's
a lot of data or there but that resulted

81
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,740
in seven security issues that they said
he said like seven on they cared about

82
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,829
and then three of them is all I ever saw
those P

83
00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:01,569
the SEBI never talk about them a little
bit more later so designing efficient

84
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:07,230
black box closing these guys didn't talk
completely unrelated to state right

85
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,790
although they tried was kind of one of
the test cases or media files in Android

86
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,329
one of their testes pretty sure they got
some charity in there but they don't

87
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:24,129
understand fully so this is this is not
related or not new but this is like one

88
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:29,480
of the first and recharge ever made was
Charlie Miller shook on saying you know

89
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,980
I can't read John Connor so he has were
based on open door which was at the time

90
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,970
actually his research will surely an
Android in this case that he had a phone

91
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,189
that was a developer phone he bought off
ebay some developer work today Android

92
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:53,040
like the shelling they were released yet
they're about to be released so

93
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:03,149
last notre this research here in the
slide deck is focused on the mpeg4

94
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:10,180
format I limited myself to civic leaders
things just to make sure I would be to

95
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,910
have a better chance of success rate you
don't wanna you wanna be like why this

96
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,839
web browser does the web browsers what
am I gonna do I'm gonna all the formats

97
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,889
and sports all was well that may or may
not be a great battle bugs definitely a

98
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:31,519
exposed definitely explode your state
space to explore alright so this is

99
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,769
awesome diagram this is a new-fangled
one day released this diagram around the

100
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:43,350
time of Google while this year so I
think I thought was weird was why are

101
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,889
they calling out media server in system
server specifically there's plenty of

102
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:52,720
things that could put there but it was I
was surprised by the change but I think

103
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,220
it's much prettier than the one that
we've all seen before I even knew who

104
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:04,819
knows what I'm talking about the old
background yeah so lots of interprocess

105
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:08,760
communications going on Android
basically every process on Android has

106
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,730
multiple threads in the Chapel of the
threads each processor all just waiting

107
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,860
for something to happen

108
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:28,060
waiting for the kernel are waiting for
the binder driver Intel in like a box

109
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,130
and enter it for those who are not
familiar relies on user based on boxing

110
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,790
so every aptitude install has a separate
user I D every sort of background

111
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,389
service that runs has a simple user ID
either really good about applying

112
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:48,189
privilege of least what is that how you
say principle of least privilege that's

113
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:51,870
the one right there pretty good about
that he always have from the start

114
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,310
solo thing you really know about this is
the live stage for a is lives in media

115
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,889
server you know that's not a trace not
on their list there but you'll notice

116
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:07,130
something important things like audio
which I guess that kind of makes for a

117
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,510
phone that supposed to bring sometimes

118
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:18,120
the audio thing kind of important so
media server runs in the background all

119
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,510
the time it starts up early and boot you
can see the process ID year I can't see

120
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,170
the number

121
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:30,280
181 or something that's really low and
then it started from a niche and it even

122
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,070
though and region it is like some
totally new implementation of how to

123
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,900
boot strapping machine up it still does
what you would expect in its reporting

124
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,490
services and automatically restarts them
whatever they disappear Kerela

125
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:52,240
restarting the service is pegged at a
minimum of five seconds between starts

126
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,040
so if you're starting crashes you won't
get one again for five seconds but if

127
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,330
you wait like six seconds in crashes one
right away so you know it's like limited

128
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,160
by start time

129
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,150
join a Nexus 5 you should have
privileges like you know your media

130
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:17,100
group media oh by the way I wanna do all
these things they're like maybe you know

131
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:23,570
not normal for a nap even the audio
group you cannot get the audio group and

132
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:29,250
less basically are the audio drivers are
you can get the camera group used to be

133
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,380
able to use real ask for the camera
group and actually removed like all that

134
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:40,720
some time ago so you can even ask for
that but let me just like this is not a

135
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:48,370
you know what you think of isolation and
putting some code often some process you

136
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:54,160
think wanna get as little as possible
while this may be as little religious

137
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,980
possible but they're really awesome
privileges right like you know I might

138
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,690
take picture of your microphone and by
the way I

139
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,160
access so just good to know that dated
back to me right away so it's it's

140
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:16,670
really kind of scary what you get as far
as like a privilege level I cannot see

141
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:23,920
this picture so this this is a breakdown
of the devices I was testing stage

142
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,520
fright

143
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:32,530
you know i kind of them here by vendors
so you can see my but the device I was

144
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:39,560
just at the time like most of them were
Nexus devices my point focusing on Nexus

145
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,360
devices was that if you find bulging
next devices they affect everything is

146
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,270
an Android people had stuff to Android
but they usually do not take things out

147
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:58,080
a survey of approaches 0 and raid is is
like a unique ecosystem where all the

148
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,630
devices are somewhat unique and so
different devices give you different

149
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,650
privileges and media server

150
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,280
the thing I showed before here with all
the privileges less and exercise so

151
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,780
that's kind of like the baseline and
then business more like an indication of

152
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:21,990
the devices that I had the plane being
here is you can now

153
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:29,950
same old stuff here it's going alright

154
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:36,020
doing this is like the top of the groups
that the way this group table is

155
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,790
generated is like I said I'll break all
the groups into you like sort of a

156
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:49,660
unique hell I think I just grabbed like
with destined for each one of these

157
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,650
things in an output from get religious
or media server for all devices and so

158
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:00,030
you know you see 51 had that group but
only certain ones had these groups your

159
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:05,830
kind of the outliers in the most awesome
thing is that you can see that some of

160
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,510
some of these devices 27 of them will
give you the system if you compromise

161
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:19,630
your service so the system is kind of
important it almost the directory where

162
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:27,760
all writable userdata lives which is you
know basically it's the things you get

163
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:39,050
way when you factor in gas so that's it
for now let's talk about the attack

164
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:44,300
service what do you do to locate the
attack surface like what you know you

165
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,470
know it's doing some kind of something
complicated playing video videos now

166
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,940
very simple thing so would you do you
know he just attached to the media

167
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,160
server process little bugger put a
breakpoint under open system call cuz

168
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:05,610
you're like you're gonna play video you
probably need open at some point and so

169
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:12,100
whenever they hit you just looked back
trace and just start digging in trace of

170
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,210
from the open system call and you can
see all the functions they are being

171
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,290
executed on the way there through stage
fright and some other libraries even

172
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:28,580
yeah so interesting point the bottom did
this this code is it weird to track when

173
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,280
you look in it was big stories because
at some point they decided to move it

174
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,790
out of framework base into sort of its
own repository

175
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:44,390
AV so when you look back at the parent
functions you start getting closer and

176
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,940
closer to you

177
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,750
the functions they're actually live
stage fright when you get to hear and

178
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:57,970
read metadata which calls so young kids
like like me

179
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:05,400
dispatcher function for all pieces of an
mp4 file for those not familiar data

180
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,250
format so

181
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,500
it's basically just like for whites for
whites and then whatever data is there

182
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:18,640
so this function is doing the older
parsing and it's a recursive function

183
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,520
which is kind of interesting and
different from sort of moderate

184
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:33,060
standpoint and you can see her as an
example where it's like a mopey drak and

185
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:40,100
we're gonna go ahead and call myself
with different offsets and stuff funny

186
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,100
point there like between 80 and 100 and
40 depending on Android version you know

187
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,600
tell exported from them before files I
think he was like a number I pulled out

188
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,530
a 23 in 140 is like number pulled out of
5 does something rather clearly been

189
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,920
developing this overtime still so take
vectors

190
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,580
tax services like what you want to look
at directors cut how you get there so

191
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,450
once once you have the attack surface
it's usually pretty easy to do a

192
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:19,190
sequence of three graphs to see where
calls going he just keep count on a this

193
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:27,140
functioning reach their benchley so just
keep doing this actually like several

194
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,119
slides slides in this Dec

195
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,419
if you're interested in kind of walking
through the whole process of tracking

196
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:41,199
back the tax service but the basic
methodology is like you know who calls

197
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:49,739
what keep doing that until you get tired
so in and read everything is very

198
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:55,949
modular as well when you look when you
when you do have to research with media

199
00:21:55,949 --> 00:22:03,329
scarin stage fright you end up in weird
situations where like you have Java code

200
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:07,549
that's calling native code is calling
Java code is going to be codes calling

201
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:11,469
service over reserves and play that it's
like more Java native code all mixed

202
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:18,279
together so it can get kinda wild
looking at that I'm sure Unicode can

203
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:22,709
definitely be wild with the use of
member variables and where those get

204
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,289
initialized stuff

205
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:31,509
luckily estate right that makes things a
lot easier as far as reading it but

206
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:36,789
another point like some doctors may be
closed source in this case hangouts is

207
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:43,289
totally closed source but it's
definitely calls in just 48

208
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:49,979
even that even though there's there's no
pain points using this methodology it's

209
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:53,819
still probably the best methodology for
figuring out texture it's much better

210
00:22:53,819 --> 00:23:02,759
than you know trying to figure out by
manual testing which ones work how how

211
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:12,599
can i play the file over and over again
this is showing video loaded into the

212
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,210
browser coming from a euro

213
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,669
that's pretty easy attack vector

214
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:24,120
you can also force the browser to
download a file pretty easily

215
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,760
basically just declared that its content
type of attachment kinda type of the

216
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:37,140
disposition of attachment content his
position so if you do that and really ok

217
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,179
I'll just downloaded automatically and
put my downloads folder

218
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:45,720
well it just so happens after its done
downloading it will also scan it with so

219
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,090
you know both ways is getting it every
time when you play at scanning it when

220
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,169
you download it

221
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:58,809
scanning it is no problem I totally our
feature requests for them like let me

222
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:01,929
say whether or not I want download
something before you download it and

223
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:10,529
then scheme that's not very nice so I
mentioned before media scanner is

224
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:16,480
documented featuring Android you can
read about it just know you're here but

225
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,570
if you just threw for media scary or
find it it extracts metadata from media

226
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,950
with the idea that it's gonna take their
metadata and put into SQLite database

227
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,330
that's exposed to a content provider
that way when the galleria pops up in

228
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,360
already knows about what all is there on
your device

229
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,220
you know it's it's it's pretty important
have histories ability but maybe not to

230
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,610
go as far as they do with processing I
guess you know you see her medium our

231
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,970
media scanner scan phone media mounted
is obviously not obviously but we do

232
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,530
about it is when you comin sdcard in a
device for example the system out

233
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:59,370
automatically ago everybody there is
news to this guy really actually cares

234
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,790
about when that happens because
otherwise putting mister card you don't

235
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,360
see the pictures ISDN card because
nothing ever look to see if there are

236
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:14,150
any picture as a gasoline tax or an
attack vector there to keep trying this

237
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:19,780
other ones I one point along the way
into research realized that if I set

238
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,860
myself a video over a mess that it would
just be stage fright right away before

239
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:33,550
notifying me before before any sound
happens you know before you for anything

240
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:41,250
and that's good living shit outta me
honestly so still client-side browser

241
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,070
downloads like I mentioned before you
can you can reach this code through

242
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,420
email though usually require you to
actively get the user to download some

243
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,260
attached injury doesn't download the
attachment itself automatically without

244
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,610
you doing something first

245
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:05,480
an email so I can IC you for sending
each other like virtual cards and

246
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,590
yourself

247
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:13,210
physical stuff like mentioned sdcard
well so you just be over Mt P so that's

248
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,280
the default mode in Android for USB
sense I think photo before that I was

249
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:28,410
like some really weird stuff where it
was you know USB Mass Storage like that

250
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:33,460
but anyway like if you copy the file
over and gp2 the devices games and after

251
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:40,750
its done you know thank you for scanning
all the things 11 Plustek factors some

252
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,150
of them I did not challenge like if you
take a picture with your camera and used

253
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:49,430
it saves it to disk it's also going to
scan it although it's you know unless

254
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,180
you take a picture of a really cool
thing that produced some sort of

255
00:26:52,180 --> 00:27:00,710
malformed tourists everywhere as well as
garish part obviously is a mess I i

256
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:07,530
totally freaked out I set myself in
mpeg4 video after I saw that you know it

257
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:13,760
should have rendered in automatically I
set myself a file that just caused one

258
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,450
of the assertions the one of the many
crappy assertions in state-run code

259
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:22,940
which he just doesn't check check fails
in a crash that self on purpose so I

260
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,090
said to myself over to carrier network
just make sure you know it's not really

261
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,680
about how to explain about really
violating terms service said to myself

262
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:38,690
and show now log out running then
crashes before you touch my devices in

263
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,300
over there on the table

264
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:47,410
definitely definitely scary so the nice
thing is after publishing his research

265
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,050
at black hat and bringing it to the
community

266
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:56,670
the Android security matter developers
removed the automatic processing of

267
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:02,770
media from both our hangouts a planned
for monitoring and also from the

268
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,000
messaging app

269
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,620
which is kinda like their new
incarnation of the old one that was a

270
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:20,840
wispy messaging app it's one thing to do

271
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:29,600
like parsing of luxury crappy stuff with
code that's nothing to do with high

272
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:37,280
privileges and it definitely is another
thing to do it automatically so that's

273
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,540
freaking freaky so where does that work

274
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:49,950
where did it work at least worked on all
devices 5.0 + right away as hangouts was

275
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:56,490
to fall hangout is supported on android
devices going all the way back to Fordo

276
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:04,950
so before that won't run announced but
even with message here

277
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,940
the original message even the original
one it was still vulnerable to the point

278
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:16,580
where like if I set myself and a master
was a bad game Mass every time that was

279
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,390
rendered in any way on the screen would
immediately like really so you know that

280
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,330
means like if you have already on the
screen and the screen that triggers of

281
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,120
all again if you try to delete them a
mess that triggers of all again

282
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:39,870
yeah seriously all done so in fact I
don't think when you try to delete it

283
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:46,160
crashed

284
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:53,320
yes if you haven't turned on or off you
know but it's not as important now since

285
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,530
they have fixed the newer versions I'm
actually willing to take like Paul or

286
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,940
like what what do you call it when you
really getting together on something you

287
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:11,040
know is that they get it right way said
poll has been a pool ok they're like a

288
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,810
betting pool on like how long it takes
them to turn his back on after the you

289
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:21,710
comfortable cuz they definitely like
their pictures of cats before you

290
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:28,520
actually something I don't miss it a
little bit but i dont use MSN I wonder

291
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,790
why so i recover that triggers

292
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:43,500
virally if you touch the video it again
if I open the gallery like again so it's

293
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,110
it's really violent it's that alone is
freaky to me there's goering so are

294
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:54,460
there any other vectors I don't even
like really explore fully all the

295
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,000
directors on my chem best that's good
enough I don't need to worry about any

296
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,680
of these other vectors I'm pretty sure
you consider yourself like motions media

297
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,270
with a hangouts message like you know
gtalk or whatever they call these days

298
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:10,900
I'm pretty sure that works there were
some good stuff coming out after though

299
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,100
the vulnerability was eventually
published that some stuff like I think

300
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:21,460
take secure something that actually
won't automatically render the media and

301
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,100
when you like click the media it's like
are you sure you want me to cause you

302
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,990
might just get on and it was like that
before I published so good for them on

303
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:37,510
that one but there could be more like
you are code like who dole was right it

304
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:48,070
could be a little so how do I find his
books I found a bug ya but you know how

305
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:58,990
much he gets out on the campaign he
approached the bugs must be stuck to the

306
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:06,039
sides great mom so I i basically use
this methodology this is a methodology I

307
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:12,370
stand by like for all projects are
really dumb one doesn't have to be good

308
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,440
just get the automation going let us
being like you read more like read more

309
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,150
understand more and more you read the
more you understand like for example

310
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,510
when you find out about the party
junction and the shield attacks there

311
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,270
you're like a I can make all the texts
like it one of these things randomly

312
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:34,390
instead of just going to the DePaul case
where does nothing so that's good

313
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,620
example like as you keep going you make
deposit better eventually like other

314
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,900
plans crashes they did you read that
code better read and we'll go to reading

315
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,299
to figure out how to

316
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:54,269
doesn't matter you just repeat until
your brain melts seriously maybe takes a

317
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:58,529
day baby takes more than one day maybe
insane if you go for 48 hours straight

318
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:07,899
but simply your brain will melt so so I
did a sort of in two rounds the research

319
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:14,179
as well as closure the first round of
research was a mere and I we decided

320
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:18,690
we're gonna fuss made before his on some
Android there was literally like our

321
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:27,470
project was made for you know I learned
there's a button applies to school

322
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:34,460
button not working I was asking on
Twitter like how do you make the desktop

323
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,529
of beer and I was like oh wow there's a
button that looks like that's what it

324
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:46,289
does the whole point of the buttons to
have but I was gonna show you some but I

325
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:54,369
can't I can't rewrite it stands green so
first time we've done it was really dumb

326
00:33:54,369 --> 00:34:02,859
treasure we didn't really bother with
building a huge Corp is our goal was

327
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:07,139
kinda like let's find the smallest file
we can find literally like the smallest

328
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:16,370
one

329
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,460
me a line if you see any the cat
pictures of the of this work and that's

330
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,710
just want you guys saw in the browser
before it as his video that we used to

331
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:30,690
be there for testing tons higher end we
both ramaposa we put together on a set

332
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,310
of devices my set was like maybe four
devices is that was like four devices

333
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:39,860
and then at the end of like about a week
we started analyzing all the all the

334
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,070
crashes to see what they were turned out
like all the crashes we hit during that

335
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,800
buzzing around we're all just terrible
terrible crashes usually just a

336
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,380
surgeon's this code is really awful and
and and they do all these checks but

337
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:01,760
then they just crash themselves checks
trail that's not very robust clearly

338
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,610
indicates maybe some redevelopment so it
wasn't really fruitful fussing however

339
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,680
when I started looking at the actual
crashes even those crashing on you know

340
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,960
Cryptologic oh that were not interesting
I start looking at those functions that

341
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:24,660
was crashing in and then I found several
energy flows so these became these to

342
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:31,950
see these down here and like literally
it was like three to four lines away

343
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:39,650
from where it crashed on some traffic
crash and was like really bad so the

344
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,880
next the next iteration now uses
excellent tool called American fuzzy law

345
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,650
I was like hey I already know about
these bugs in states where I have a

346
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:53,029
point FL St try and see what happens and
what happened was

347
00:35:53,029 --> 00:36:00,959
FL was created to use automated feedback
through code coverage in order to build

348
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:05,189
a corpus like that but it's not meant to
be if I find bugs although it just

349
00:36:05,189 --> 00:36:09,429
happens to do that it's meant to build
you know lots of input their reach

350
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:15,319
unique pass in the program is
interesting is the second round

351
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:19,549
methodology was basically same thing its
first except for now I was like a bird

352
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:25,729
in the sponsor crashes like mad so I
stopped at every once in a while you get

353
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:31,579
all the crashes triage look at the code
it's crashing in there are just no fixed

354
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:37,469
about the source so why not fixed a bug
fix the bug start father again and just

355
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:42,819
keep doing that till basically there
were no more crash and that took about

356
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:47,519
you know maybe two or three weeks the
second round with me

357
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:57,169
cycling and fixing things were going so
I tried all kinds of different modes of

358
00:36:57,169 --> 00:37:01,650
FL is different modes I tried one where
I have a dictionary that was all day

359
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,169
before tags that found bugs that all the
other ways that I try to run before that

360
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:10,640
didn't find bugs so definitely
experiment with different modes of play

361
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,179
with a film which I highly recommend if
you want to find any bugs it's a very

362
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:25,499
disruptive tool for discovery about
3,200 tests per second when I R on my

363
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:32,239
third you call box it was super fast and
that's why I could get away with running

364
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,099
it for only like a day or two

365
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:41,089
keeps track of CPU time and it will take
place at Al three for three days on this

366
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:44,110
box with just her second it tells you
actually

367
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:51,980
for like six months of what you would
normally considers CPU time that's so in

368
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,810
the end result is in the second round I
found even more bugs that I didn't find

369
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:01,270
before which was awesome and I basically
did have to do a lot of work finals bugs

370
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:06,250
and also shows the NFL fines good bugs
as opposed to the dump father which

371
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:16,240
found crappy crashes where you know
close to bugs bugs and shells so yeah

372
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:23,100
claim playing the blame where less
severe bugs those are all over the place

373
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,580
personally I consider one of those
crashes it's an assertion to be bad even

374
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:34,460
though it's not really necessarily a
security problem you shell but still

375
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,950
your audio is gonna drop for up to five
seconds were they could get worse than

376
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:47,290
that obviously media server crashes and
doesn't come back to get stuff for

377
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:54,240
example then your device will brick like
what's going on my phone is like screen

378
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,750
wont come out will go up like a service
big deal

379
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,810
my research I put it infinitely
interplay of babies are recycled desk

380
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,860
too early

381
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:08,700
rebooted my device forgot about a dozen
place and it did not boot all the way

382
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,690
got stuck waiting for media server
waiting on a nice little animation right

383
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,700
before you see your home screen

384
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:23,730
fun to try to fix specially because I
had like su disabled while it's booting

385
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:39,530
now so it was a bug summary I like see
like to be on this like you know what I

386
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,150
disclose these to google it was like
well here's these patches for things

387
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,760
that are really important and then
here's this pilot patches that fixes all

388
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,640
the shit i think is important but not as
scary really just like two billion all

389
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,720
in all I sent him well over one hundred
and twenty different changes to Android

390
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:06,070
in the first disclosure I was just like
any guys go I mentioned before that sees

391
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:12,150
that the Intel guys got credit for a
fixed in AOSP these are the these green

392
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:21,290
bug numbers and this is the commit
message for the fixes it turns out they

393
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:25,339
were like ok well you know there's an
inner growth slowed down here when you

394
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:30,890
try to multiply the size of the UN 32
with some staff oh well it comes out the

395
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:38,220
file and they're like well if we do the
same thing if we do this math and store

396
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,660
in the 64 bit and injured no energy flow
Walker

397
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,020
detected it's too large larger than 32
bit possible value and then we will say

398
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:56,490
you know well it turns out that when you
multiply multiple 32 bit numbers over

399
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:04,880
here what happens is even though this is
64 bit it multiplies mala takes to

400
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,819
resolve that then page 64 bit so that
was actually a while if it's some bugs

401
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:15,030
in this code found some bugs

402
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:25,130
and then when I ran FL my second round
they kept finding this a look at the

403
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:34,060
assembly like I see yes so that did not
fix anything looks like something and

404
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:40,230
here's a quote from you know one of the
Wizards out there and see program he

405
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:48,050
says in Seattle had 32 bit numbers
number again and you lose anyway which

406
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:58,440
is exactly the same happens so that
check actually did nothing at all just

407
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,069
made him twice once for the check

408
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:07,059
once for their own

409
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:12,930
yes we we are so anyway that's
embarrassing but educational right like

410
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:19,259
this is a very weird quirk for sure you
know CH C and C++ or full reports like

411
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:24,130
that you know how r flake said one time
to me is like you know you wanna find

412
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,979
holes just open the season back and
search for the word undefined and then

413
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:34,109
understand that and then go you know
that code and you'll find tons of stuff

414
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:41,910
and its subsidiary so I can really be
exploited I mean I guess it's not really

415
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,910
a mystery at this point whether or not
these things should be exploited a lot

416
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:50,259
of them resulted in memory corruption
and in the heat it turns out you know

417
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:54,819
there's not really like he cookies and
andrea there's not really like a lot of

418
00:42:54,819 --> 00:43:02,989
hardening so this is kind of a week era
even today for Android hehe bugs are

419
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:22,979
really hard to kind of fix or or
mitigate away like magic when I try to

420
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:30,150
exploit it although I think properties
within the system were often more of the

421
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:36,989
challenge then the medications
themselves so a quick recap the media

422
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:44,150
server it's always spawning
automatically after you crash the SLR

423
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:48,180
weaknesses I go ahead if you're not
familiar with that psycho process forks

424
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:54,549
devices off itself all apps thereon
including system server for self and

425
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:59,219
just creates those without doing any
sort of exact Cisco so that means the

426
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,979
address space between all things coming
from psycho or the same as what's the

427
00:44:02,979 --> 00:44:07,259
address basis so if you have an app
that's totally like I only want internet

428
00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:07,840
promotion

429
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,180
and it looks as some Jana or something
similar code inside of it looks at its

430
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,570
own address space that's gonna be the
same as system server which is running

431
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:25,310
with like almost hi spillages you can
get on it possible to retry forever so

432
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:30,840
even if we're just crashing crashy
crashy crashy crashy one in 256 you win

433
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,300
if you just keep trying

434
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:39,110
definitely enjoy possible to be bypassed
or even through sheer brute force

435
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,620
without any sort of magical tricks you
can have a really crappy crappy exploit

436
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,550
and it would still eventually land
probably unless it was really really

437
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:53,280
crappy so that there is the downside is
that it will have a plus you're you're

438
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,820
always thinking with both hands to bed
gay and you could do so in this case a

439
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:03,670
surplus her good guy so there's less
determination determined determinism in

440
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:08,040
Android because all process and lots of
threads are waiting for stuff going on

441
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,540
so they're in there was actually a new
mitigation act attitude Android 5.0

442
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:19,850
funny story they did not know the end of
this medication to Android 5.0 liter but

443
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:27,430
its cool they changed the gmail orkut
triangle as well from deal Melek which

444
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,790
had been for many years but they also
included this new injuries armitage

445
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:37,140
mitigation they came in with VC vai but
also adjust their thinking ability to

446
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:46,830
build teams like OGC 580 that's cool he
503 put in there and come to find out it

447
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,930
prevents entirely expectation of some of
the bugs definitely all of them but some

448
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,330
of them

449
00:45:54,330 --> 00:46:00,640
so here's a summary of them how
medications playing and I should give

450
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,290
the slide tackle 20 matter on he you
know fortify source oh well fortified

451
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:10,730
source does it really work if it's a
dynamically allocated memory has no idea

452
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:17,830
how big should be so I can tell you when
you're right about you know I wasn't

453
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:21,720
there for a long time not properly and
it comes to find out there still are

454
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,960
actually isn't really a big help anyway
of course an extra stair but you can

455
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:33,190
just drop around that its cool round the
clock in any mitigation definitely like

456
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,000
I said some of the bugs makes me
exploitable we trigger them you can

457
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,270
still trigger then but it turns them
from memory corruption into adult

458
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:49,080
service where is just like I can dial ok
for gigs of memory are you kidding me

459
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:55,740
I mean like it goes this is going to
overflow and it sets the maximum number

460
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:04,400
works maxing locations never work so I
should update this line I say because

461
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,980
when I was doing the exploitation of 140
just cause I thought to be easy mode

462
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:14,890
turns out 50 texts easier too bad but
SELinux just come into play on 50 texts

463
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,750
always enforcing on and reiterated that
point so I I gotta show me as well I got

464
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:23,950
good execution and media server on 580
and I can't just run a shell and it's

465
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:32,470
like to show all psychologists bring my
own shell in right and I was like wait

466
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,000
to bring my own shell in its predicate
shell whenever I try to do anything as

467
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,580
Shell tells me you cannot exclude
anything so that's where the but it does

468
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:49,550
come into play here but DNA is basically
after you have execution then you start

469
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:54,720
hitting the limit of 160 is definitely
not like I definitely would never stop

470
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,900
you from streaming the audio of the
microphone out to your cell like they

471
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:09,010
can't this processes literally intended
to do that in some cases so that address

472
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:17,820
space layout randomization the big
bypass shocker 32 bit address space

473
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:27,160
spray yes one very large thing very
large can split it up it's one so lot of

474
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,470
address space you control right away

475
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:35,230
other virtual memory tricks on there
because I don't need any of those really

476
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:43,000
just guessing you know like a day from
entering security team is like yeah

477
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,690
we're interested in like a slur bypasses
that are not based on statistics I'm

478
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:53,290
like ok but when attackers gonna go for
whatever is easiest and that's like gee

479
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:58,109
what happens in that picture cool one
you know you tried ten times and it if

480
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:01,140
like one of the numbers comes up five
you're gonna be like that's the number

481
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,820
for me I don't want these other ones
that are not the same big one and that's

482
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,260
totally my approach to some of the
bypasses in its Larry are done they're

483
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:17,710
so little bit of recap on a slur like
being a 2.3 there's no es la really at

484
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,990
all it's hilarious because they had
sports wrestler and colonel and two to

485
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:26,510
three but they were building the
binaries without the flag says I want to

486
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:31,530
be random and then ice cream sandwiches
they added some something as they

487
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:37,599
finally started using the right compiler
flags or but it still weak meaning it

488
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,770
without full randomization you basically
have no randomization so in theory oslo

489
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,180
was was a big deal in these other things

490
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:49,400
and it turns out like a jelly bean and
chicken sliders actually like more

491
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:59,050
effective than you know that's lessons
learned from then to now she goes on I

492
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:42,400
like try to do a live demo or bag
somewhere works john Q democrats let me

493
00:50:42,400 --> 00:51:04,030
know it's kind of like you know I don't
have any way to show you this in a good

494
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:16,339
way really I can play the video which is
like liberties mood so let's do that but

495
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:19,200
again no escape

496
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,589
works

497
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:42,119
still owe it to see if I can turn on the
radio in airplane mode is now so we can

498
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,940
play this video

499
00:51:43,940 --> 00:53:36,460
waiting to see if I can get this thing
work life I don't know

500
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:43,759
can you imagine hearing that everyone
second from several phones

501
00:53:43,759 --> 00:54:01,219
yes yes the things alright I had put out
a type a little more before I can

502
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:16,339
actually do some painting demo

503
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:29,159
explain how this seminal work basically
an individual UCB send a message to

504
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:33,509
myself which is true however I'm not
sending them over at area network

505
00:54:33,509 --> 00:54:38,479
because I feel like that would probably
be banned the fuck Russia networks don't

506
00:54:38,479 --> 00:54:44,479
do that instead I actually spent like a
week and a half or two weeks of

507
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:48,139
developing this whole thing where it's
like I went to look exactly like it's

508
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:50,989
supposed to look when it comes from the
current work but I want to come for me

509
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:58,399
at all but there's no requirement for
that like exploit like doesn't depend on

510
00:54:58,399 --> 00:55:04,759
me being in the simulation environment
it just it just helps

511
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:11,359
purposely know for the for the video and
so on a Windows or would like capturing

512
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:41,390
in it

513
00:55:41,390 --> 00:56:03,440
this is literally I don't have to make
it a little harder so I'll do instead

514
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:10,779
will be a little bit more fun I guess

515
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:23,349
yes I will try to set up the demo 2011
around with it today but for now what

516
00:56:23,349 --> 00:57:08,419
we'll do is we'll run a different
exploit the $5 explained that always

517
00:57:08,419 --> 00:57:24,679
tough one but it's always there so what
is on the device here have fun how you

518
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:31,109
saw them some crashes everywhere around
here let's turn on my screen on my phone

519
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:34,970
on my desk at home isn't it

520
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:52,970
you may not want right now we're going
to turn wifi back on the basis of

521
00:57:52,970 --> 00:58:20,260
students use service enables maybe
what's going to happen

522
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:26,390
a request came in yay request you'll
notice that they're not very shy and the

523
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:36,480
browser on Android there's kinda like
here's my buffalo rhino Android it's all

524
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,540
that like oh my god fragmentation and
diversity is so saves you like by the

525
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:55,430
way here's exactly everything else come
on do it

526
00:58:55,430 --> 00:59:03,900
women's curling it's not growing anymore
that does not look like a shelter me

527
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:20,730
it's kind of slow today explained last
taking longer than it ever has taken

528
00:59:20,730 --> 01:00:16,220
before I wanna come watch

529
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:48,369
crashing into remission and Iowa Wow

530
01:00:48,369 --> 01:01:18,299
it was not crashing anything which is a
very bad sign for trying to exploit

531
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:26,789
stage right in this case back up again I
think we should wait a little bit cuz I

532
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:34,990
like it that much when you go down on a
break when you first wake up attacks

533
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:41,160
area where it's going to be booting like
your tax money that's good

534
01:01:41,160 --> 01:02:00,980
come on make some request uses yeah
maybe they did some other modification

535
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:10,480
to the system to prevent it from the
browser which would be awesome

536
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:24,220
it's not even trying to like how much
longer do I have to fail as immediate

537
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:28,080
past where you guys I won't be offended
if you leave it on a drive for another

538
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:38,070
minute maybe the slides for

539
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:49,300
I'm really upset because it was working
yesterday Brian can vouch for that so

540
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:57,190
far away as were wrong window one of
these has slides can you guys tell me

541
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:02,110
which one this one right after it again

542
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:09,010
alright so gentle failure video though

543
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:17,190
worked what about getting fixed rates I
reported it to the Android guys with

544
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:22,120
patches I was basically like at the time
they had no bounty program and the

545
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,560
clothes thing they had was what's called
the patch rewards program so I was like

546
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,720
ok that means in order to get even a
chance of any money absent patches which

547
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:35,590
is like okay that's fine I'm generate
patch same way so when I first set in

548
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:40,620
April he had told him hey check out
these tricks critical remotes and

549
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,910
they're like

550
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:49,020
will offer you $1000 and I'm like wow I
thought I was gonna be 20 or something

551
01:03:49,020 --> 01:04:00,210
but ok I'm going to McDonalds McDonalds
and then I try to work my magic like you

552
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:03,579
guys really care about this should
clearly be important

553
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:18,160
like without a reaction like you get own
day when a way I could only convince

554
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:25,229
them to raise it to 1,000 around $37
that's really all I asked for was like

555
01:04:25,229 --> 01:04:31,299
you know do you recognize the quality
and importance of the work with a fancy

556
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:39,650
number and they're like yeah okay there
was no pushback on it was like done so I

557
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:44,869
did you know I didn't you kind of sets
of patches and because of that I gave

558
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:47,440
them extra time on the first set of
patches

559
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,990
the idea was to have to solve fixed
before black is black hat was where even

560
01:04:52,990 --> 01:05:07,390
I could not avoid publishing it without
being big do so also reported them to

561
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:13,740
Mozilla has a bountiful yeah and two
black fallen silent circle through the

562
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,280
crowd they also have a bug bounty
program so although people think like

563
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,440
only made like $1000 total off all the
staying all the media wanted to be in on

564
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:27,150
its actually more like around $7,500 so
I have some bug bounty money if you guys

565
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:33,609
want some drinks let me know I have this
pact which is like a money comes from

566
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:37,390
the Goonies is just kind of automatic
speller make sure but he has a good time

567
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:43,960
and I contracted it so but right now
there's more bugs bunny money than

568
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:51,250
people drinking so hey sorry question in
Parliament from everyone is like a 90

569
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:56,099
days is kinda when I wanna coordinated
to go public with everybody so then was

570
01:05:56,099 --> 01:06:02,050
alone he proceeded to like affixed to
their tree and I was like what does it

571
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:05,420
mean to you guys what does what does it
mean and they were like well for US

572
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:13,829
embargo means we won't publish a public
advisory oh ok well

573
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:18,819
that's not what it means to me that we
had a heated discussion in to get one

574
01:06:18,819 --> 01:06:24,130
point we both have ended each other and
and then back down sanity I think they

575
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:30,969
threaten me and I threaten them a little
bit but anyway like the next time just

576
01:06:30,969 --> 01:06:37,410
require just request no code push
embargo or something like that

577
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:44,079
difference but again for your guy say if
you want them to not publish to fix for

578
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:50,859
your stuff like asking not to use
specifically just to screw up my ass

579
01:06:50,859 --> 01:06:56,380
hole like I was totally cool publishing
the pics in binary 42 liquid black phone

580
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:01,690
published a picture by reform because if
your pet is like for you that's hiring

581
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:13,690
people do that especially bad guys
because again it's hard work so everyone

582
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,640
was great to work with

583
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,779
even though you know like I mentioned
that the little bit his bat with Firefox

584
01:07:17,779 --> 01:07:24,440
guys over the embargo saying
everything's good now a parole they are

585
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,619
sorry in August they rolled OTAs
basically the day at one stage of life

586
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:32,950
and they had kindly to say including
they say

587
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:39,339
hey all the top poems have today just
committed to fixing these bugs on all

588
01:07:39,339 --> 01:07:45,800
the stuff and they showed like a slide
with all over you know top top dog

589
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:55,859
flagship devices including like previous
generations so as far as how well

590
01:07:55,859 --> 01:08:00,990
they've delivered on that today I don't
I don't know if it's really acceptable

591
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:07,630
how well they've delivered but they're
trying to energize accepted the cold

592
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:11,710
patches I sent them like pretty much
immediately they were like man I think

593
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:15,250
the first time it was one day in the
second time it was like three days and

594
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:20,140
that's probably because the senator
Friday or so of course but just cuz

595
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:26,380
that's when I got doing and show times
they're like hey thank you very much for

596
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:30,430
the patches and it was just totally
different guy than $1,000 of course but

597
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:35,219
you know they were very very
appreciative thank you very much for

598
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:38,469
helping us making it more secure in that
this is just before they had a bounty

599
01:08:38,469 --> 01:08:45,420
program but it was still affected in 38
likes it push it right away the guy

600
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:52,730
there is a maniac the media guide but it
may be a good way so actually I did all

601
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:57,250
these patches and sent a multi-room
alright and thereby the Firefox fix was

602
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:04,750
like in two spots and fix all the bugs
reported too so it's just a different

603
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:11,299
Jim and choices and at this point there
for so different that can change so we

604
01:09:11,299 --> 01:09:16,880
also created the CH a real quick there
when we blew up we were like hey

605
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,839
we want to give people more access to
have think it's actually persuaded the

606
01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:24,159
Android security team to be a little
more liberal with who they allow to have

607
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:28,130
access to a gym bulletins which if
you're not familiar that's basically

608
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,900
like what you doing now

609
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:35,270
monthly as a public security bulletins
for Nexus devices and basically that

610
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:41,909
report is same sort of report they would
say in like 30 days earlier 2008 AP so

611
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:45,880
one thing we noticed what I noticed when
doing this work was for example Amazon

612
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:51,230
was not given access to the step that I
sent to reach parity so I had to like

613
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:54,429
reach out to them directly same thing
with black that's the reason why I had

614
01:09:54,429 --> 01:10:05,920
their bug bounty program because Google
him tell about any pools at all so we're

615
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,580
still running GHA although now they've
been very little more liberal so it's a

616
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:16,790
little bit less of an important thing to
do so I updated the slide have changed

617
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:21,710
it was hilarious because I still
happening the updater still rolling out

618
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:25,489
so people haven't got whenever still
some people never will I'm really sorry

619
01:10:25,489 --> 01:10:29,670
for you guys but why throw anything to
stop it again updating the trash or

620
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:39,380
senator me up within the droid army but
anyway so the long tail man I don't know

621
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:46,590
if I have the diagram I pray now I know
I'm Way over 1000 nobody stood me up

622
01:10:46,590 --> 01:11:10,750
bailey's one of these windows I thought
I had an air sign of that he's use green

623
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:13,150
is designed allen's greens too much

624
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:22,590
alright so so now they're doing a
thirty-day patch cycle and make it good

625
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:29,219
on this will in September and in August
so they're definitely committed to doing

626
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:34,510
it they are doing so that's also you
guys should probably expect to maybe get

627
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:40,520
another update was something about stage
fright maybe like next week or the week

628
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:48,929
after I think they are posted his next
bulletins like first Monday of month or

629
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:53,929
something to that extent so that same
time to roll the OTA updates push all

630
01:11:53,929 --> 01:11:59,610
the code ASAP so be ready for more
updates and hopefully not too much more

631
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:07,369
media buzz saw the update is troubling
these in fact that's been the case for

632
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:14,239
the last two updates and probably will
be at least for one or more tension

633
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:17,310
there's tons and tons and tons and tons
of killed more people need to look

634
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:24,500
clearly is not looking or even paying
anyone to look so yeah somebody should

635
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,160
do that

636
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:32,590
for some stuff is fun at least you get
to see things blow up at the very least

637
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:37,860
another important point from all this
research is that medications are not a

638
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:38,530
silver bullet

639
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:42,060
you can you can say well as a large
gonna fix that well unless you actually

640
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:47,030
try to see if it really does stop that
you don't know it was something

641
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:52,090
automatically restarts forever a slur is
never going to be your thing that you

642
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:57,770
care about like every thing that stops
it can take a little bit longer so

643
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:00,980
people need to be more attractive than
they actually are starting to do that so

644
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:04,300
I'm really happy about that I don't
really have any more slides other than

645
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,710
all these bonus lads like tons of them
but i dont wanna go through those now

646
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:14,780
already launched but you can go through
them later as they might have a question

647
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,050
I love question
