1
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,580
thanks for coming out at like fucking
nothing o'clock so I recently decided by

2
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,640
speaking of that I like I deserve a
slight clicker in this is changing so

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,470
anyway when temperature I do security
engineering for payments company called

4
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,270
stripe make the subjects that were
pretty little and you've never heard of

5
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,660
us that they're starting to get really
ironic anyway I'm here to talk about

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,850
that all called doctrine which is a
debugger implant 4G being LDP which are

7
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,230
going to in more depth in a second but
Eminem full disclosure I didn't write

8
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,710
the storm headed but then I went ahead
and we were a couple of fairly

9
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,460
significant component of it as well as
get really excited about some crazy

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,890
bullshit that I could build on top of it
which I did which now I'm gonna show you

11
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,560
see it's not quite old but I love the
card in it now a little bit of

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,260
background of me I grew up in Australia
service engineer told that I build

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,369
infrastructure for a while now I do
security engineering at various points

14
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:17,380
of broken things ever and always ask me
how to pronounce my name so I have this

15
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:24,299
kind of pronunciation guide my slides
now like richard and I guess like given

16
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,280
that there so few people here if what
i'm saying is I making sense that you

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,390
have a question like just asked me what
we gonna be easier to answer it halfway

18
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,579
through then have me talk to twenty
minutes about things that I making sense

19
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:44,070
and then trying to anyway like why why
even use it in the first place is like

20
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,060
brother you can divide into two
categories so you have like static

21
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,670
static analysis tools like I don't have
a capstone and dynamic debugging tools

22
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,850
like to be able to be went back alley in
general lake that the two main use cases

23
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,250
for using about her is that you're
interested in finding bugs the basis of

24
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,990
exploiting them or finding bugs for the
purposes of killing them

25
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,310
you can kind of use this tool for either
of those things

26
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,370
my my big demery which we're gonna see
how this plays out when you have a

27
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,190
twenty-five minutes all can organize a
23 minute timer is to find and exploit

28
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,660
probably the dumbest memory corruption
bug ever written by anyone and he did a

29
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,530
victim that I could write next but for
really really fast but so does anyone

30
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,710
recognize this I realized that the
screenshot is terrible being able to

31
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,750
read it isn't super important no one is
like cringing visibly so I'm guessing

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,590
that none of use fractals TV and so this
is this thing called Practice GCP in it

33
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,980
which is this like monolithic script
written entirely in like GB's

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,300
scripting language instead of the pipe
so you know in bed Python in GB which is

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,940
how this all works but before that was
possible in GB seven GB had this like

36
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,170
fortran looking scripting language and
her dislike genuinely short of amazing

37
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,720
things like from the bottom of this is
like the GDP product this is like a much

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,130
prettier disassembly of the next year
instructions because I think the stock I

39
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,300
wanna say that this is some arbitrary
region pointed to by one of the ridges

40
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,730
Israel to register is the flags and then
play some more state of had and

41
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,380
basically every time the bus stops just
like Prince out this huge data section

42
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,750
in which is like kind of me in this is
often all of the stuff he won but not

43
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,050
necessarily and it can be extremely
flaky it turns out the GB's just like

44
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,960
nickel-based and the more courage you
lured into GB the better your chances of

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:52,090
like randomly cycle Team GB at the point
where you're reading What like a call

46
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,790
from one device to another debug go to
try and recover your state you really

47
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,440
have to question your life and your
choices and so is there and I was kind

48
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,150
of thinking like there has to be a
better way so anyway like we basically

49
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,360
decided to stop hitting us else and
particularly but their like there's good

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,980
reason that I do you have shiny point
click into basis I went into doing a lot

51
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,430
of people straight because

52
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,859
security things and we prefer to hire
people with like reason politicians

53
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:25,180
there and it applies to do with someone
recently who is like using IDE and like

54
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,110
I consider myself a connoisseur of fine
about it is and the like

55
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,110
inbuilt Python debugger in like whatever
you'd like Jeff Bridges I think I D is

56
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,360
like fucking awesome now and I kinda
wish that I had that so instead we kind

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,500
of figured that like we would build
something a little more modular and so

58
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,360
this screenshot that's also really
really difficult three dozen

59
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,560
is just the new LG me so this is what
happens when you let a file that a break

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,849
point and solid and you get
significantly less information than in

61
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:06,820
fractals she'd been it but how could we
make this more useful this whole talk is

62
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,099
a screenshot you can trade so basically
what this is is a team accession which

63
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:17,919
are working now and again I'm gonna have
some great at some point in the future I

64
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,449
so this is just an LDP prompt with very
little magic in it and this is a view of

65
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,789
the stack

66
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:29,960
I do have a better one of these
disassembly the kind that frames the

67
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,720
batteries and the register view but the
things interesting about this compared

68
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,880
to fractals thing is that these are all
team up stains and sort of the way that

69
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,320
I said the site was I injected the
implant and then as I decided that I was

70
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,580
interested in some new pieces state I
slid off mighty mic session and created

71
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,460
a new view inside of it and so i can
text early vote on look something like

72
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,460
this so basically you have the debugger
itself which has this RBC count on

73
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,460
written in Python injected into it which
is very very deliberately has occurred

74
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,130
as possible in it because crashing TV
and movies like super easy we figured

75
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:19,210
the less card that we can stick in there
and then it has three front and one is

76
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,480
this thing we call RPC which is adjacent
AP either just

77
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:30,410
a Unix socket and very recently / out an
HTTP API on the side of it I like it we

78
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:37,400
are both pretty much entirely built as
experiments even work if it turns out it

79
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,610
does I honestly sort of implied by that
but I fully believe that it exists I

80
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,380
would love to someone built like a shiny
friend in this in the browser we got as

81
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,680
far as like a wiki pages of you in the
coming months interest in it but the RPC

82
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,460
endpoint is extremely well documented
works really well and has a bunch of

83
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,790
like neat features like for example if
you're running car that runs inside of

84
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,460
the bug yet to be incredibly careful
about what you do with threats GB has a

85
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,260
sweet bug where in spite of the fact
that like technically it should be safe

86
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,710
because of Python semantics if you try
to access any GB internals from a thread

87
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,870
that isn't the main pipe thread in spite
of the fact that all the pipe thread

88
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,700
still back onto a single machine thread
because of the girl it might just

89
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,540
randomly crash and everything you know
and love is gone and we let you work

90
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,060
around that because you can have
extended process is kind of like

91
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,310
slashing the side PCB I as much as they
want and we've gone through that

92
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:35,620
ridiculous legwork in gdb land of making
sure that only access it is we kind of

93
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,370
had this like worker on the main thread
that services actual GB internal so that

94
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,800
you can safely do what the hell you want
without destroying everything you know

95
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,410
and love

96
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,520
quickly stepping through the views that
I this is really really sorry I the

97
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,250
story of my life is every time I get
this off the projector is very very low

98
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,790
resolution so this is the range of you
there's nothing tremendously interesting

99
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,640
about it probably the most interesting
thing is that it shows you the registers

100
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,960
are changed in bread which is really
convenient if you're just like stepping

101
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,240
through a program really really quickly
trying to work out what's changed just

102
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,540
shook hands how she would have said
who's made any sense so far yes good

103
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,260
times sorry I ever looks a little bit
blank but it's also who like nine

104
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,580
o'clock in the morning so it's hard to
say why

105
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,230
alright apples I really like docks and
so it was just too perfect have a duck

106
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,529
stock

107
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:33,009
that document offers about us anyway so
then we have staff you this is also a

108
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,769
little bit difficult to read more
interesting I'm going to talk about a

109
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:40,430
little bit so basically what this is
done if you don't you dance for you

110
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,319
probably recognize the huge block of
Hayes that is probably a sign of some

111
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:45,610
are still putting a fuck ton of aids
that is whether or not something you can

112
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,720
crash but this study was actually a
little bit better the vitals

113
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,740
it also makes an attempt to dereference
whatever kinds of memories of her every

114
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,290
word aligned everywhere land value it
has a look to see if there's like a

115
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,410
string literal at the other end in which
case we'll prove it so this is like that

116
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:08,209
and this is that these are just
underneath to stop it can do things like

117
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,910
take function pointers and wherever
they're actually pointed to see these

118
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,559
are appointed to the entry point dishes
function point out that we're gonna have

119
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,749
a right to Denver for a great success

120
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:23,040
straightaway gives you like a little bit
of extra context in that like values on

121
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,600
the stock

122
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,040
you can just kind of like eyeball I know
whether or not they're interesting

123
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,449
without actually having to like go
through the rigmarole of copy pasting or

124
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:35,430
looking at whether it'll just like show
them team we just kind and finally it

125
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,730
has a December that sucks a little bit
less than the one it doesn't do a whole

126
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,149
bunch extra although it will result
symbols as best they can

127
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:49,209
its attacks highlighted if you're kind
of into that sort of thing with these

128
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:53,699
are the three main begins it also like
the doctor was a little bit more generic

129
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:57,309
in the technically system memory of you
so there's some interesting region of

130
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:01,220
memory that you've found through static
or dynamic analysis you set up another

131
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,050
memory of you and say like hey I just
wanna look at this specific thing but

132
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,540
sorry

133
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,029
in the spirit of like having tempted to
demagogues like a champion last night

134
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:13,300
I'm going to use up the last 15 minutes
of my talk with the demo

135
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:22,110
so basically what I've done is have
stood up this lake inferior precise if I

136
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,829
get this exactly right whatever I type
in here will this way I don't have to

137
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:31,050
break my neck strain it occurred while
looking over my shoulder so what I've

138
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,059
done it is treated this like victim
victim program we're gonna have a quick

139
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:36,630
look at it

140
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:47,420
the spot I do so you can see with a
certain way and to be clear like this is

141
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,090
designed intentionally to be like not as
not as late as possible I also had to

142
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,040
use a bunch of wacky compile files or
even make this exploitable because

143
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,940
modern compilers I want you to do this
kind of thing but I wanted to basically

144
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,160
sure like how you can visually find
these bugs instead of just like pretty

145
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,650
much of aids and then likely to call you
can see that we are located 150 issue

146
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:14,920
stock were positive mike foale k is not
to read in this cold so everything's

147
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,780
going to really hardly and specifically
you can see that we're loading deception

148
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:26,930
point to say hi and sorry say hi does
exactly what you think it would look as

149
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:32,760
the saying goes that conveniently
there's also something called unsafe we

150
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,550
just lost his first title system which
is probably something you're interested

151
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,030
in

152
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,900
so the first thing we're gonna do is
grab the dress event is compiled without

153
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,360
as as La

154
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:57,720
jumping into the actual card dynamically
so we have a victim because I am Not

155
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:07,610
Call of alternate which is the actual
thing about me today said a break point

156
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,290
of the program and then will actually
start having a look at what's going on

157
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:18,220
so we can stand up to stop to you which
shows the current like the current state

158
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,420
of the stock I spent so much time this
morning trying to work out whether or

159
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:27,220
not a head-spinning sensitive my
environment to be clear this also works

160
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,440
a lot better when you can have a much
bigger terminal but there was a battle

161
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,860
of wits between readable screen real
estate and scream real said it all when

162
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,010
I was trying to send up my democrats
morning and then I'm gonna stand up to

163
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,300
register view which is very very
conveniently is cut off but all the

164
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,530
stuff we care about just barely makes
under the screen so I am trying

165
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:58,300
furiously to wake up so no I have the
disassembly view as well which is just

166
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:05,650
like a little bit pretty in that saddam
highlighting shit and I'm definitely not

167
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,860
gonna be wasting that's going real
estate as as I step through the program

168
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,910
considering just doesn't change things
obviously every time you evaluate

169
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:20,210
destruction rip changes in this instance
I just really pushing the old frame

170
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:26,690
point out onto the stack as you can see
my old friend point out that way that's

171
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,839
on my screen I get this sorry I'm
furiously pointing to shed you can say

172
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:39,190
this is the only point of it is just to
the south since the Sacramento man so as

173
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,770
we step through its allocated a bunch of
room on the stack setting up the

174
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:50,770
arguments for this recall all about and
that's important and so we step into

175
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:58,710
this culture raid just gonna step out
and say like to know it stepped back

176
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:07,180
into the main function and then as we
step are very very good everything

177
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:15,890
somewhere up here it should have said hi
Debbie DeMars let's quickly tried again

178
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:22,690
and see if I can not good at this time
we step through intercultural read about

179
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:37,560
econ and so sorry that so as you can see
it's not as stocks fortunately this is

180
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,889
kind of too small to work out if I can

181
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:56,420
begin this nationally to actually
finally so when I was driving up there

182
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,230
is that you can see the doc and way up
here you see this function pointed to

183
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:07,869
say hi that's about as far as we stepped
through the rest the program is called

184
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:12,839
us he acts this is gonna be really
exciting battle between which things you

185
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,249
can see it's got the call us he acts you
can if you very quickly I believe you

186
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:24,079
can see the value is the same as say hi
if the stock goes straight up the stock

187
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:32,410
answer when we call it it prints hello
debbie is in our own what I want to do

188
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,559
is like instead see what happens if we
like act like it's 1999 and just put a

189
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,139
fuck ton of aids in places where
everyone's input will probably lead to

190
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:45,109
something interesting so again we're
just gonna step through much time like

191
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:51,829
it's a break point but it's probably
trigger if I just step out of this and

192
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:59,339
this is I'm happy you guys I certainly
is I serve our stock is being happily

193
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:06,379
obliterated by A's so including
specifically that function pointed it

194
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:07,509
was like sitting at the top

195
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:14,769
care about and so as we step are very
more things in life raised in TX TX

196
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:24,259
which bolts because I don't think anyone
map the page 41 41 41 41 41 great we

197
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:32,610
have VIP control so finally we actually
when I like the same because sir

198
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:48,490
even so quickly right next week for this
and like learning explains how it goes

199
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:58,570
really really well so basically what I'm
gonna do because this thing is like this

200
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,250
really naive victim that I read the
explicit purpose of exploiting it just

201
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,530
goes system but things are you posit
which is convenient for gonna take the

202
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:16,169
first argument and alternated to what
lengths because basically if I can

203
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:28,700
actually demonstrate this so we started
until we point on the stock

204
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:40,130
god that's not how you have to give them
a minor daughter so basically the reason

205
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,730
that padding this is because if our
daughter doesn't doesn't sit on a word

206
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:50,260
boundary then when we like basically
stopped spraying yes because like I know

207
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,840
it's going to end up somewhere in that
general vicinity

208
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,290
if you're not one line then I pointed
doesn't have the benefit of being a

209
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,460
switch it doesn't hurt you slide it so
we're going to make sure that its allied

210
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:18,080
28 bytes in 6 finally we're gonna
creating housing which is just the

211
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,290
second thing we're going to do is take
this point of that we have this function

212
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,160
pointer for unsafe from that we already
captured from psychoanalysis and we

213
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,169
don't even if he compiled a five to 10
of Islam

214
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:44,249
and finally we're going to do is dump
air show us we're gonna pack as little

215
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:49,100
Indian quad word and we're gonna do this
like a fuck ton of times because we

216
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,769
don't know exactly where the stock is
going to end up and math Assad so

217
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,850
fingers crossed

218
00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:07,499
if we now run our x-play I D and this
point out and put it into a victim card

219
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:14,889
for a expecting that to happen this time
the morning but so if we're interested

220
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:19,929
we can actually like see that working in
the debugger as well so instead of type

221
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:26,879
II directly to a victim gonna stick into
a final and then I'm gonna run errands

222
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:32,570
furia high-paying in from a file and cry
so this is the syntax for it I have a

223
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:43,869
sneaking suspicion that is not know how
to pass arguments to Jesus

224
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:49,330
sorry I'm having a massive brain fart
forgotten how to redirect them but now I

225
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:55,350
actually what I'm going to do is take it
is right that this works instead sure

226
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,679
he's more like cool stuff that can be
viewed as I think that's both more

227
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,169
interesting and I have a better chance
of getting away with it

228
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:11,779
I swear my professional sorry there is a
differential calculus which is just

229
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:24,119
basically a program to calculate out and
basically what happens is any any value

230
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,850
that is like an immediate and an
immediate end to judge it impacts as

231
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:35,509
like next we'll have a stop trying
temperatures and an ASCII string or to

232
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:41,970
give you the binary representation and
this is like to kind of me but it's

233
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,029
mostly only useful as a mechanism often
when doing this you like me to calculate

234
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:56,570
a fuck ton of assets and so now you
spent all that time you spend time copy

235
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,970
pasting immediate values from the debug
into like a pile of rubble to do math on

236
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,159
them and then copy them back into it and
we kind of figured are

237
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,919
I kinda figured if we could put him
straight out of this thing where if if

238
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,850
you start counting on and you already
have some running you can purchase them

239
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,359
very directly so for example if you do
get a ripped it pulls the value of

240
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,909
ripped straight out of the area and
shoves it into your process and then for

241
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:32,559
example if you wanted to grab a large
section of memory you could go sailing

242
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:52,360
ok so basically like maybe a better idea
would have been together next 10 by the

243
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,100
stock but so what this lets you do is
instead of copy pasting values a little

244
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,909
place now this really is just curiously
Bergen said no I see what's going on

245
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:12,309
you have to use tax yeah yeah that works
wait and see what you can do is you can

246
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:15,100
use this kind of in combination with
what we already saw which is that

247
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,249
everything is really small now think
this is the right place surveilling

248
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:24,169
shove a bunch of A's onto the stack and
then do this again and then don't skip

249
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:36,870
math priced domains

250
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:43,610
you know what I am just going to give up
because I'm terrible at this

251
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,660
the justice basically that like
incentive cover basic ingredients left

252
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,780
right and centre little place you can
just like have your by the rebel right

253
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,180
there

254
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,809
values and like to mouth on them
directly instead of digging around sorry

255
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:58,350
that i'm gonna stop flailing wildly in
my city fifteen minutes early in the

256
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:16,050
morning and answer any questions about
them no one did you get a valid ok yeah

257
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:22,070
I think someone did they win their story
so to be clear I talked a lot about how

258
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,250
this theoretically supports GB and
honestly like it's mostly snare and a

259
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,230
little bit myself maintaining the same
and to be honest the card that we use is

260
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,020
the only card that we know for sure even
like fruits let alone like actually

261
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:42,610
works and certain stories I i I would be
more than happy to fix any bugs report

262
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,050
what did you show me how it doesn't work
on Windows I will fix them whether or

263
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:51,670
not it'll still work in three weeks
after that it turns out that unit

264
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,760
testing something that persisted Diego
which in turn into very precise is just

265
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,150
like this and say well we've like we've
done our best to write some tests I mean

266
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,950
like sort of knew that the RTC protocol
pretty much works and we have reasonable

267
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,679
confidence that there is nothing much
like sending the white trash can I crash

268
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,770
the IR colonel yes supporting other
problems not really being like a huge

269
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,980
priority so there's a 30 bucks thats
whats which is BBB which is like at some

270
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,780
point where did you get it cuz that's in
physical form that sort of just by gets

271
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,920
out of bed in the morning and some
rendered like being like support baby

272
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,410
and we moved the shit out of it and I
have no idea if it works so yeah I

273
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:39,679
strongly suspect that like honestly on
winners while GB like sort of works

274
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,070
inside and sequin

275
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,280
I just don't think it's like the
debugger

276
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:50,910
anyway like I suspected that thing you
want is like a dog but an issue if

277
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:55,390
nothing else it just sort of be funny to
have this working at some point yet

278
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,460
sorry this is a really long we didn't
ultimately unhelpful and so on but I

279
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:08,400
