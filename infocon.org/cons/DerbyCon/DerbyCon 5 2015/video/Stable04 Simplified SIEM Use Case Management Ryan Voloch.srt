1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,549
event manager use case that base basics
review the Qwikster going to review a

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:10,389
quick start steps to get you going and
reuse schema of a sample data base and

3
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:17,160
we're using same reports so how many how
many out there have a sim in there an

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,300
organization should hands how many of
your organization's formally documented

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,480
manage what you want to do what you want
to do it yourself and what you done with

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,989
your sim many ok but hopefully it will
help so why am I doing this so hopefully

7
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,820
this can be helpful to others when I get
back to the security community whose for

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,550
its for those who might be stuck in no
longer you hella mean even need to

9
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,020
simply needed to prove that they need
them when they have a simple they don't

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,750
know how to manage because it's such a
high-level effort to manage and organize

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,050
them about me in this order of priority
in the Christian husband father and an

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,809
information security engineer I graduate
from RIT in my twelve years I have been

13
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:11,560
directly related with SIM completed over
10 different enterprise systems such as

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,930
like dop idea IDs now all kind of
different technologies implemented have

15
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,990
experience with multiple Sims developed
to security operation programs and then

16
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,540
I'm currently deployed for a large
for-profit education system that has

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,200
about 800 800 using universities with
80,000 students and we support their

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,600
operations for their servers in and all
the schools are connected to the network

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:48,960
everything here in this presentation is
vendor agnostic so enjoy that so what

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,540
does but as a sim use case will do
anything you want your sim to do it's

21
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:00,340
actionable output in simplistic terms
defined a sim use cases what you it

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,820
defines the who what where why and how
it could be an alert reporter dashboard

23
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:13,450
could be as simple as idea or as
in-depth as correlated

24
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:19,910
32 with different types of data we're
gonna go through an example use case

25
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:25,480
this use case is going to alert when
there are over ten failed logins on a

26
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,569
critical UNIX server and inform the SEC
ops team could be alert you see there

27
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,530
there's a picture of Hydra and that's
what that's kind of the type of attack

28
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:44,580
password cracking it's designed to
designed to learn and just a very simple

29
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,680
I think everybody understands this use
case and we're just gonna walk through

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,410
that so why do you want to maintain a
sim use case data base

31
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,690
well you know you've heard people say
well you don't want to believe the ocean

32
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,569
well at least you wanted to find that
you want to boil ok you should be able

33
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,680
to do anything you can dream of
providing the data innocent but there

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,739
are you know there's a lot you can do
every environment you know they are

35
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,599
there are going to be standard use cases
at every environment gonna almost every

36
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,880
environment after directories you got
your firewalls you got even there's

37
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,500
going to be some standard some use cases
that you have your environment can be

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,850
very unique because you have different
networks of different host you have many

39
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:37,160
different variables that makes your
organization unique helps you document

40
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,519
in organize your ideas now in the middle
of the night ideas are really good for

41
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,569
me something will come just think of
things and you want to rewrite down to

42
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:53,829
make sure you write it down before you
forget it so you have security incident

43
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,959
lessons learned findings we have
insecurities and you won't have a place

44
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,880
the document them a lot of times when
you have a lessons learned meeting new

45
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,819
don't have the time to really talk
develop the use case instead of just

46
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,849
developing the use case at least
documented in your use case that abuse

47
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:17,510
you also get the capture the requests
you can get from other non-security I T

48
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,930
teams are you still has lots of useful
information in it so

49
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:28,840
place Rican dude up and when I say
whatever you say you see TV on your the

50
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:37,300
acronym means if you are a sim developer
this allows you to prioritize your time

51
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,970
and effort if you're the actual in
making the developing and making the

52
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,740
code in your sim to actually make it do
things to help you prioritize helps you

53
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,770
determine what did he want to collect a
lot of times you don't know where where

54
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,300
you should be focusing your data
collection efforts does it really have

55
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,110
to battle with a lot of these things

56
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,580
allows you to develop work you you know
that just just identify will help you

57
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,610
answer when I work on next helps you
keep up with the ever-changing land

58
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,780
landscape and thinks that change every
day you're gonna find new use cases

59
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,169
every day we need to we need to keep up
with it when you manage so every use

60
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,550
case has a as a life psycho and that
typically goes from contact concept you

61
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,280
an idea to development as such as a
burst in and it goes into production it

62
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,159
where it where it will be there and you
may have to tweak it a little bit and

63
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:43,310
then it probably goes to its death and
just start with another one the

64
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:51,139
lifecycle helps keep your use case data
base helps keep your sim developers and

65
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:56,970
consultants available you know I know a
lot of times seems require specialized

66
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,800
efforts and consultants and because
they're such you know take a lot of work

67
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,860
to manage when you go in contractor or
consultant have yours

68
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:16,610
use cases documented so that they can
actually work off the requirements know

69
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,349
they're much like their much like
programmers they take the requirements

70
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:26,389
in the developed him once when you have
documented prior even in the statement

71
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:34,700
work it's it's actually it goes much
much more smoothly that that consulting

72
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:41,490
engagement a lot of times also I found
that consultants will help update your

73
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:48,029
use cases because of their experience if
you're consultants as like a sim

74
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:52,849
developer having providing use cases
that you do develop in a format like

75
00:06:52,849 --> 00:07:00,440
this will go through as definitely very
impressive

76
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,360
value metrics and some statuses we get
some work to do versus work accomplished

77
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,000
statuses are just to see what you can do
with the working and working have done

78
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,440
just to show it also shows some
usefulness operations program that

79
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,740
supports can also be provided to other
entities with an organization such as

80
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,370
auditors when you'd actually don't want
to show them your sim you could simply

81
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,210
show them what you want what you are
doing in your sim and just having quick

82
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:42,169
report will allow that to occur what if
I don't have a sim you could use the use

83
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:49,740
case data base define your needs to
replace your manual reviews and actually

84
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,539
start document what you're doing today
in your manual reviews document your

85
00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:00,560
process gaps and he also developed a
total cost of ownership things like you

86
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,419
know we collect this data

87
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:09,620
you know we don't will be more more
accurate and will spend less time you

88
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:17,580
know looking at logs you can also
utilize that tool to replace an existing

89
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:24,849
send me he can't do it what you want to
do you want to include that used his

90
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,540
data base in your RFP to

91
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,000
when you have a deadbeat you could say
okay I want my sim to do this this this

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,059
and this what I found is when you're
purchasing or looking to replace the SIM

93
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,280
is will the question is will how to can
you do it how much effort does it take

94
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,140
so and what I would do is probably is
part of the rpgs

95
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,510
ask them to rate on a scale one to 10
how easy it would be to implement this

96
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:55,610
use case or even asked how many resource
hours estimated at UCM cannot satisfy

97
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,260
your case is probably time to move on

98
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:09,390
ok what I'm providing is a simple sim
use case data base it's just a it's just

99
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,570
an Excel spreadsheet it's really nothing
fancy it's designed to be useful

100
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,190
functional and easy or some other
frameworks out there to help you manage

101
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:25,490
use cases but this was really just
simple and really focused around sim and

102
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,280
hopefully hopefully it will help all of
you quickly get started with managing

103
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:38,150
some use cases so just a quick start on
that you could download you could do you

104
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,500
like you could start now in look at the
spreadsheet as we go through this

105
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,300
the URLs down below but what you want to
do when you get it will delete all the

106
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,040
the sample data that just some sample
data they're just remove it and at the

107
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,960
data validation tab allows for drop
downs and a modifier scheme started it

108
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,819
all right so let's get the schema

109
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:10,350
of the sampled data base it's just the
key idea just a key just like any other

110
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,819
data base we talked about the status is
before us that the bout that life cycle

111
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:26,669
use case will go from concept concept to
death or disables the status there so I

112
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,679
also want to a good

113
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,639
another interesting thing you could do
his statuses as you could put things you

114
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,879
could put other statuses and in such as
India review or manager approval process

115
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:44,629
but when something goes in production
all those fields and in the status

116
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:52,669
should be filled out once its
introduction titles very important basic

117
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:56,769
what it is it's the name of the reporter
dashboard dashboard or whatever you're

118
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:01,439
creating and should be intuitive and
make sense to its recipients at this a

119
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,019
lot of times it could be in the email
subject

120
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:10,679
keeping insisted within your sim so if
you change it in your use case that a

121
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,939
search engine just make sure you update
the spreadsheet as well so everybody

122
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:21,189
knows that the talking about their FB
referring to this is a good example

123
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:27,959
naming scheme scheme is pretty important
to allow for organizing filtering and

124
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,879
sorting when you have hundreds of use
cases and it also allows people to

125
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,889
really understand what they're expecting
or expect understand what they're

126
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,139
expecting the reason they see something
when they see an alert reporter

127
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:47,359
dashboard is smart example titles were
gonna call our sample use-case UNIX

128
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:54,140
excessive failed login to critical
server alerts fibers what type of

129
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:02,930
output is it report dashboard is just a
you know what type of cases and it's an

130
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:11,300
alert probably the most advanced think
it's doing and then I realize that

131
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:17,730
simplified but this is the most advanced
thing is a calculation will first go

132
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,470
through important stopped left there is
you know how important this is to their

133
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,820
business case we multiply that by
development effort means just how hard

134
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:35,770
it is or how much time it will take to
develop that Yusuke senior SEM and then

135
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,630
you we can you could multiply that by
multiplier if you have the data by two

136
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,030
with collecting data is half the battle

137
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,010
just double it if your data is in your
sim than that increases your priorities

138
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:56,590
core which is at the bottom so so it's
important time development effort to if

139
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:02,400
that if your data is already in your sim
and really the purpose of this

140
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:10,380
calculation is to identify quick wins
there is primarily a primary and

141
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,770
correlated data source concluded by
fifty generic samples actually recommend

142
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:20,780
you go specific like and you'll see some
examples coming up in this example was

143
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,200
coming from a UNIX syslog feed there's
primary security detection

144
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,530
classification leader some
classifications based on my experience

145
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:40,390
that you can classify his case there are
other classifications out there and meet

146
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,520
you could correlate with other
frameworks such as the various framework

147
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,810
the vocabulary for event recording
instant sharing if you're if your

148
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,550
environment is more web application
focused for detection of detecting

149
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,740
security threats you may consider the
web application security consortium the

150
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:05,630
whse classifications in this example it
is an unauthorized account usage

151
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,190
classification

152
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:19,040
next gonna go through some openText
deals you some examples of what they

153
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,940
maybe they can be whatever you like

154
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:28,270
benefit ROI think something like ok
rather than merely reviewing every log

155
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:34,250
file you can save 10 minutes per host
and then that's how we're winning back

156
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:40,780
healthy return investment is is
occurring

157
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,320
versus me no longer view description in
goal just a description of what it is

158
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,090
you know this is an alert 10 failed
logins occurred from a critical server

159
00:14:52,090 --> 00:15:01,030
pseudocode analogic simple query is
actually very helpful when you find

160
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,220
something in your sim you're in your
analyzing you found something you want

161
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,690
to go back to it you can lose it very
easily he and this is something you

162
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,460
could actually I suggest you put the
query or a reference to the query of the

163
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:23,700
data that you found in a prior instance
helps you develop quicker and just next

164
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,030
steps we are what we need to do to
develop this number pushed the use case

165
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:38,720
forward that yeah there's some more
fields here author will give people

166
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,920
credit for adding things to the use case
data base developer who made it happen

167
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,210
date when I went to production alert
priorities and that's if you could find

168
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:54,630
that based on your environment how you
doin learning reports frequency however

169
00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:00,400
you want in a scheduled report to go out
the responsible group is basically the

170
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,630
recipient of the content

171
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:10,730
go to an email address in the procedure
for when that drew or recipient receives

172
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:16,930
that content you want to include
instructions will this case no contact

173
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,730
the user to figure out if you

174
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:26,209
the user was militia service fingers
password 10 times are or what does not

175
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:35,470
go over some reports it's just a little
funny thing to actually not simulated

176
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:43,910
but when you export too much data
reports production alerts by responsible

177
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,980
group good for marketing your sim what
you're so strange operations program

178
00:16:49,980 --> 00:17:00,070
does report for concept alerts by
category responsible group so it's a

179
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,870
prioritized menu of the help you
identify what you want to develop next

180
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:10,309
based on your security category and in a
responsible group you'll see their the

181
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,669
priority scores in the middle

182
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:15,709
it's in this case data loss

183
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:20,220
security operations center has a
priority scored 24 and it seems to be

184
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,839
the highest use case that was something
you probably want to focus on next if

185
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,130
you're concerned if you're concerned
about data loss and the security

186
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:34,030
operation center can do ice cream before
you attempt another just

187
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:45,150
alerts by status reports by status give
you an idea of where all your entire

188
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,120
programs what your entire programs doing
and in the classification out the bottom

189
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:57,040
left is the your production learn what
you really learning on so in this

190
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,950
environment this example by 43% all use
cases are focused on wall where the

191
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,240
right hand side there's the concept

192
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,690
the data sources I was talking about
earlier you really want to get focused

193
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,630
our detail little bit better than s
probably on your sources you could count

194
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,080
of you know thirty firewall alerts are
you know what you're doing for Windows

195
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,480
security event logs

196
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,429
just another view potentially a manager
point of the security manager point of

197
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:32,760
view are you could see ok where my focus
my efforts were my efforts at the

198
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:41,140
current moment based on security
category capture metrics to overtime

199
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:50,980
you have to do that with this cases and
see the top of the development effort

200
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,200
and the number of the number of
production alerts and a number of

201
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,299
concept alerts overtime kind of cross
each other well that typically means

202
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:04,380
there is a development effort where all
these cases went from concept to

203
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,669
production that's actually our
development into production that's

204
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:14,530
pretty that's a good thing works done so
how do I fill up my use case that

205
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,870
because it could be a whole talk on
itself but here's a quick quick tips

206
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:26,660
first is your brain security analyst
your data really really gotta just think

207
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:33,640
of things a different technology get
into her new log feed you study it what

208
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,429
can I do with this data to help help
detect and techniques and other good

209
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:44,870
sources out the box seems that seems to
be a better a new thing these days where

210
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:52,910
the use cases are built on customer
requirements much like a program pen

211
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,760
test results

212
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,340
definitely one thing if you are a
customer of a pen tester ask your pen

213
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,360
tester to provide use cases based on
their pen test in the format that you

214
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,360
have such as this format just given to
the schema and fill it out if you are

215
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,870
pen tester potentially include this type
of format in your report

216
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,820
risk

217
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:24,310
results internal external definitely
good places vendor customer forms a good

218
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:31,250
place to find use cases and another one
is just asked on attendees ini I like to

219
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,650
ask other people what's your best sim
use case what's what's really working in

220
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:42,130
your environment you know come home with
that and just as do it sometimes you get

221
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,930
some really good ideas just just asking

222
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,280
we've mentioned security and sent
lessons learned meetings that's

223
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,240
definitely something very good source
for your environment to get use cases

224
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,060
and ultimately discrete dot com also has
a decent place for for use cases ok

225
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,790
that's it

226
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:08,000
here's the good you could download it
here but he questions the back
