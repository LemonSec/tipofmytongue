the next party trick was like that's

3
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:39,670

6
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,500

horny if they come back again because I

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,299

9
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,820
50 countdown before my speech this is my
fourth Derby Conn mr. McConnell one

10
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,450
unfortunately I think would be so
awesome in them like should I go now

11
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,540
it's so awesome I summit talks three
times I needed something for number

12
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,310
three only two of them got accepted so
is my second speaking but this is the

13
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,070
one you want to watch as the 11 2012
fast we know what classes you wanted to

14
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,509
all the times that right for all the
room picking or anything else

15
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:50,840
PowerShell good closed or so people can
leave too I do have donuts if you think

16
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,300
a donut you came in late

17
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:01,920
we got plenty of donuts so my goal today
is to talk about fishing as a service

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,470
right defining what that means in
helping you build your services around a

19
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,760
fast lap solution so my goal is to talk
to as if you were both a consultant side

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,160
of the house and you want to do better
services for clients and also as if you

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,140
were a client wanting better services
from your consultants right so I see

22
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:30,380
both sides of the sides as they are no
pun intended I wanna make sure that you

23
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,940
know if you're offering fishing in
either playing games with your

24
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,790
consulting your fishing I want to make
sure you do it better

25
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,750
right I want to elevate you to next
place where you should be right I guess

26
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,750
even if your client in your tone people
please fish me I want you to understand

27
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,960
what that really means when you really
should be getting out of them and why

28
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,580
you should be doing it as a Service
ongoing in forever and pay monthly

29
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,239
premiums and stuff like that

30
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:12,260
some good consultants and clients when
you're here to for the dance so here's

31
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,000
my little legal disclaimer I represent a
lot of different companies depending on

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,040
the day and who I'm working for some of
the companies represent have nothing to

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,520
do with this talk I can't say anything
about them I can't say what I do for

34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:36,459
them some of the companies I own so they
support I talk I'm a horrible boss oh so

35
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:42,170
it all depends on who im representing us
up as as a representative myself I

36
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:48,100
endorse everything in hearing and we'll
be talking a lot about vendors and

37
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,269
products and I don't want to sound like
a commercial for any one of them but i

38
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:55,920
wanna make sure that's known that I
don't

39
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,060
make any money off of any of them don't
get anything from any of them I'm not

40
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,730
being rewarded to save this company or
that company I i talked about to vendors

41
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:11,040
at most one is threats because I have
the most experience with threats and the

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,770
other one will be fishing line simply
because our sponsored recon I know very

43
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,280
little about fishing line but I know
their name out there since they

44
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,230
sponsored rubicon let there be kind and
when you could come back let me know

45
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,910
because I curse like a sailor I also
mumble and stuff like that so if you

46
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,169
don't understand what I'm saying

47
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,510
research and and I'll say it again when
you don't understand the game just make

48
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:42,060
me think there was something great for
about 20 something years which means I'm

49
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:49,160
old it's really been a passion of mine I
started off the government arena doing

50
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,710
really hands-on geeky stuff and moved up
into more the management the bad words

51
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,510
management side of the house but as I
grew and became more and more aware of

52
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,870
the business side of the house right
making things better

53
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,780
my last talk here Derby Conn was so you
wanna be a pen tester right and it

54
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,669
wasn't necessarily talking on the
technical skill sets and you need to be

55
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,600
a pen tester was talking more along the
side of the business aspect of what you

56
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,150
need to be a pen test this is gonna be a
similar talk not necessarily how to fish

57
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,310
people and how to be a better Fisher in
getting better

58
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,460
template and get crowds and stuff like
that but how to make that it better

59
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,039
service for what you offer out and once
you get in as a client

60
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,830
couple things you should know about me
first one is I'm lazy right if you had

61
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,000
any kind of social engineering skills
you probably figured that out just by

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,669
looking at my fancy but I'm not up here
cut ripped look this guy up your workout

63
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,100
and no I'm lazy that's a good thing
right

64
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,300
his laziness is the mother of invention
was not the society whoever came up with

65
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,220
a quote

66
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:01,190
bullshit I didn't make remote control
because it was necessary right I made a

67
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,830
remote-controlled as I didn't get my
recliner right

68
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,940
lazy person I look for ways to make
things better and be a differentiator

69
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,660
between my company in other companies
right so that's what got me all my lines

70
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,040
of fishing us a service right I want to
do things that others don't but i wanna

71
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,370
do it in such a way that so easy to do I
don't have to do any known if

72
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,730
deprogramming alone though days or
anything like that right and fishing as

73
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,810
a service is easy so even the lazy
people like me can do it I'm certified

74
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:42,540
by pyrolysis joke sorry I am assist I'm
a lot of other things too so I'm little

75
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,280
certified like meditations and stuff but
I'm more like this so go off on changes

76
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,590
in Ranson suffer less shiny squirrels
just let me know homie back in I thought

77
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,890
it looked a lot like me maybe with more
hair but one thing that I learned nobody

78
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:05,360
cares about the presenter and you might
get on to talk so who are you when I saw

79
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,220
it and senior consultants I saw his
client's right I wanted to be

80
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,550
interactive infants sentence was a small
audience and Sunday morning not too bad

81
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,430
Speaker I hope I want you I said you
know ask questions as we go

82
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,180
call bullshit as we go right to
challenge me Jones each other

83
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,400
tell you you're wrong and then throw you
out

84
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,250
third on inside you because I'm always
right to ask questions as you go

85
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,580
hopefully you want to know more about
fishing right looks like an efficient

86
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,010
this kind of fashion right particularly
fishing as a service right why go after

87
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,100
one person can get one credential and
get a little bit about the company when

88
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,330
you can go after all the fish in the sea

89
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,920
go after everybody in the company know
exactly what they're running and

90
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,840
what they're doing right

91
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,380
why he wrote down to one or two people
when you get everybody why go after one

92
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:15,580
person when you show up the one person
you could get thousands in the company

93
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,310
right so when you do with fishing as a
service it's so easy to cast that net

94
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,130
wide and figure out who to go after
afterwards it also gives clients more

95
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,790
data to learn about how they can do
their training and how they can do their

96
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,640
control so they can come become better
right

97
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:38,110
why do we finish it works right I don't
have to worry about firewall so I don't

98
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,020
have to worry about anti-virus will
sometimes and I don't have any physical

99
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:50,450
control they put him between me and the
person they will write Java Adobe all

100
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,990
that kind of jazz that makes it easy for
me to fish so why not right there's tons

101
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,920
of all abilities role though right

102
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,650
if I can grab some credentials and his
credentials existence and work I'm you

103
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,830
among the network is you don't have to
worry about cracking passwords or

104
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:14,250
anything like that so this is the reason
we had for this story we have to put in

105
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:22,160
here I'm somewhat common tools for
fishing right she told kid that wants

106
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,060
worst fishing frenzy fishing frenzy
pretty good I don't know how many people

107
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,230
have used it before it gives you the
ability to build templates that come

108
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:38,040
from good templates on it's own it's got
a lot of promise but it's not there yet

109
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,010
and when I mean not there yet i mean
it's not mature enough for fishing as a

110
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:48,150
service yeah I sold my soul is very good
to us in a couple messages and get

111
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,340
things back

112
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:57,640
SPS I think his name was Eric didn't
talk on that the other day this is one

113
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,460
of my new favorites is it will do the
harvesting the emails and everything on

114
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,920
the reports all from one thing and you
know being lazy person that's a lot

115
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,420
easier 2012 lista to tools it's a lot
less typing on a keyboard so that's

116
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,040
always good

117
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:18,089
and then when I want to mention was lucy
Love You More about Lucy leader so all

118
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:41,779
these two kids and everything right what
do they have in common

119
00:10:41,779 --> 00:11:12,850
so you know who click click on the other
tools you can tell who based on the

120
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,230
credentials that were harvested rate so
far and SPF and I sent the dow 250

121
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,880
people I know who clicked it because I I
can see that it was Raymond in the email

122
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,940
address right in the past for the device
and about three min than that had to be

123
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:32,029
the person I clicked it right now but I
don't know the forty nine other people

124
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,160
that I sent it to I don't know what
happened to it on their desktop right

125
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,250
just talking from a photoset I don't
know if they do and they're made it to

126
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,920
their in-box I don't know if it was in
their spam folder I don't know if it was

127
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,500
sent anywhere else to somebody to say
hey look at this and is this garbage

128
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:56,399
that I click on it and things not work
because that happens you know in the SPF

129
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,300
talk about you know sitting out bogus or
a bad fishing intent was the other

130
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,959
client information and people are still
clicking it but one of these things of

131
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,790
these all have in common is they make me
look sexy but I try to get this guy you

132
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,540
know my slides I found one time when I
was doing the USB rubber ducky talk

133
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,240
and i think is great so he makes all my
flights but they make lazy people like

134
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,130
me look sexy right I can do it
consistent model that's repeatable right

135
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,290
and when you're in a consulting world
that's a very important consistent and

136
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:40,440
repeatable why is that important to keep
costs down we keep costs down profits go

137
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,730
up right where cost me $100 to do this
fishing in 10 years is $1,000 and

138
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,680
$10,000 lure fishing at 10 when I make
that money I'm getting done now I'm

139
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,740
clearing more and more money so I need
consistency and repeatability of my

140
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,010
phishing attempts you get that out of us
right we're gonna be talking about the

141
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,500
tools in the vendors and what we can do
it as we grow this so that's one key

142
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,760
things that are immediately right out of
us

143
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,420
the second thing they have all have in
common is a lefty Grove shells and they

144
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:18,810
love you to grab credentials right allow
you to pop boxes great right

145
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,320
how does that help your clients as a
consultant how does grabbing a shell

146
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:38,380
hope your client's you want your own
it's good I like to answer yeah I'm

147
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,720
going dresses and 34 more flights but I
like that you know

148
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,630
budgets good it helps them depend really
depends on the goal of the engagement

149
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,230
right now I'm finding that the reason I
want to push that as beneficial as a

150
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,480
service and why I'm getting behind it is
because I played the other side of the

151
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:05,040
fence I've had to deal with no running
security programs throughout my life and

152
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:18,950
I know the pains of running a security
program right so the fish deficiency

153
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:26,140
problem the people are still a problem
that was a benefit to that problem so

154
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:33,770
they're all great but no that's not my
buddy just there for clarifications so

155
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,410
shortcomings

156
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:44,360
where they wear these tolls for flats
you have to configure them right no big

157
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
deal

158
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,730
usually for five lines you know with
said it's a 1164 to you know so I'm not

159
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,810
talking about a lot of different things
when you actually running the tool sets

160
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,200
right if you modified fishing frenzy I
would say that's a lot more work up

161
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,880
front right then just running set or SPF
as an example right you gotta get them

162
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,380
configured and working you also need to
do all the other things that come along

163
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:20,610
with registered the domain domain names
are going to register for this plan 110

164
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,490
right you have to do stuff that's
enticing to them to click and then come

165
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,930
back to you right she had to make sure
that we have enough information from

166
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,490
them right in

167
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:43,160
they lacked statistics by fast gives you
the statistics very easily write this is

168
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:50,740
my 10 and 12 hold off to turn this when
the question was why don't people pay

169
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:57,320
for fishing test if they know that
someone will click it and that's a big

170
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,840
question why even pay for this right we
heard a weird the answer here budgetary

171
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,180
concerns it helps me get budget right
well this is where I had to start my

172
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,089
little rant from sorry we have to
understand

173
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:16,860
where things are going on what things
are doing so I went down into the three

174
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,490
things one is overloaded our clients are
overloaded it's not you know sometimes

175
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,779
it is for budgetary concerns sometimes
it is for compliance check boxes and

176
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,670
that's all they want they need a third
party to tell them this because they

177
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,449
need to click that off and that's okay
because they need a checkbox otherwise

178
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:40,959
it on the budget or otherwise get find
whatever that's an acceptable answer for

179
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,660
why they would want to do fishing in and
why they would pay for even knowing that

180
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,100
they'll get pop another thing is they
may be trying to do the right thing

181
00:16:52,100 --> 00:17:03,670
right that was perfect timing I love
that they may be trying to do the right

182
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,640
thing so they may be trying to do

183
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,669
security awareness training they may be
trying to set up their their their

184
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:15,449
perimeter security control so that
things can get out if you did click it

185
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:20,899
right they may want to know what is
working what is not working they need a

186
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:29,200
need your help to better plan on how to
fix all that crap right in without good

187
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,010
statistics it's hard for them to do that
right was that one person that clicked

188
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,490
an anomaly in only one person that was
only time I really clicked was enough to

189
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,000
give me a show yes but was a rare is
that person always click things you know

190
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,460
I need a fire that person has every time
I see Michigan Tech today click you know

191
00:17:50,460 --> 00:18:04,419
when Team Blue Team coffins defense so
no comment on that later too often

192
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:09,700
solely focus that were true difference
with focus to me it's all purple right

193
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:17,190
because I'm Ravens fan right it's
because you know since she was a broad

194
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,260
Ravens

195
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,530
looking at Ray Lewis right whether or
not he was a criminal it's a different

196
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,880
story but he was a great linebacker is a
great defenseman why was a great defense

197
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,290
it wasn't because he watched offensive
pace right its cuz he watched often says

198
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,720
he often saw all the time so you should
I know how you can attack me I know how

199
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,260
you gonna run the ball and i wanna talk
right so we need to know both sides of

200
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,820
the fence be affected you get that out
of that third thing when rant about

201
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,870
really quickly

202
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:56,990
his business acumen I grew up through
technology and very geeky and hands-on

203
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,510
and all my reviews were did you do good
and you program well did you write

204
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:08,130
everything was technically the national
leadership and management in all my

205
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,300
yearly reviews a result of thing called
business acumen do they understand the

206
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:20,600
business what's happening right we as
security consultants are probably the

207
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,680
weakest in that arena we don't
understand the business and what's

208
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,380
driving the business for our clients
when we do fast that will help get

209
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,930
enough to 26 and stuff for them so that
they can get back to their business

210
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:38,880
teams better justification for things
like budget controls and stuff like that

211
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,480
with renting it on to what we're talking
about fishing as a service thank you for

212
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,730
being told that I know that's what
boring part of the talk but sometimes

213
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:58,370
you forget stuff I was just so as a
service right the generic definition for

214
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:06,070
as a shirt and this is me paraphrasing
equipment owned by service provider and

215
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,950
users to use it simple enough right

216
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,980
somebody else on your computer and they
say you want to use part of my computer

217
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:24,380
so my own email server and say you want
to go ahead right I don't have to worry

218
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,180
about anything to worry about

219
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,530
the structure the infrastructure and
things like that know from a security

220
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,590
perspective maybe we do want to worry
about how that's all stored but from a

221
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,530
form of a benefit in standing up
perspective I don't have to worry about

222
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:44,470
any of that stuff right I pay for Gmail
or sign up for Gmail Gmail and other

223
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,660
worry about it working they have to
worry about it work right so what is

224
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:56,020
fast this is from the social engineering
social engineer it says allows

225
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,960
organizations to determine baseline for
susceptibility to phishing attacks by

226
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,900
using simulated real-world scenarios on
users were able to track what people are

227
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,360
doing now we're getting those statistics
now or what's happening right but more

228
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:21,180
importantly while also giving our
clients what the really watch regardless

229
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:27,220
if they know they want it or not this is
what they need and want to show this to

230
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:33,830
them and you educate them on this they
wanted and what I have done several

231
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:40,970
fishing as a Service gigs and it's such
an easy we sell because once they see

232
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:47,980
the first to like their hope is like
crack I just want to go right so what do

233
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,250
they want

234
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:55,790
trying to gather they wanna see that can
be exploited

235
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:01,490
Jess right they know the answer is yes
so they want to know that they want to

236
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,580
know a lot more than one another 4 W's
and they want to know a whole bunch of

237
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:12,870
different stuff so what are the obvious
right who is clicking on my emails right

238
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:23,240
the person the sex the age the office
who is clicking on this if I say that

239
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,970
email out the fifty people and I love
spf so I'm not knocking that is at all

240
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,040
is grateful for what it does

241
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,750
i really suggest more people use it and
support it

242
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:43,270
but it's not fast so if I use SPF and I
send out emails 250 people I can do you

243
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,790
know open source intelligence on those
fifty people and I can get the ancient

244
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:53,420
sex and everything of those fifty people
relatively easy thing to do but I'm lazy

245
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,760
so why would I want to do 150 people and
why would I want to do on thousands of

246
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:06,450
people are trying to fish organization
has 9,000 people in the 3,000 people in

247
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,370
it and you didn't know the sex and age
and this and that from those 50,000

248
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,650
people good luck with that you know
hopefully the reclining G as a service

249
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,240
comes up quick enough so you can just
say to all this for me otherwise you're

250
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:27,770
not getting statistical stuff about them
they want to know what I that's the

251
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,830
other WV want they have no other for WA
want to know what we're people using

252
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:40,480
when they click click that phishing
attempt from my phone didn't click that

253
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:48,820
phishing attempt from home from work
office for my laptop from a server from

254
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:56,820
wherever right I can tell that when I
use fast tools so I can tell you you're

255
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,910
clicking on it from Android device in
San Francisco that's important to our

256
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:11,160
clients right to everybody that I can
tell you everything is running long that

257
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,710
browser when they click it

258
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,880
Java Adobe summer-like

259
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,910
all useful information when I'm trying
to educate our clients and help our

260
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:29,450
clients get the proper security controls
in place to fix that stuff

261
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:39,309
third and fourth when we're right when
they click it where the click it how

262
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:45,630
useful would be go back to your client's
say you know I sent out a thousand

263
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:52,000
emails your Baltimore office 0 clicks
UDC office 0 clicks

264
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,730
California office a thousand click was a
tell you right off the bat that mean

265
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:03,070
Baltimore DCR safe safer because you
know your next campaign may be there the

266
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:10,490
clickers but it does your training has
made up the California tells you to get

267
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,490
onto your management in california say
wTF why are you at the beach and that

268
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:22,260
train your folks right this is stuff
they need to know and there's so much

269
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,470
much more

270
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,200
right the effectiveness of their
security awareness training right do I

271
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:34,960
get repeat offenders what types of
emails to this person click this person

272
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,289
clicks on their free coupons for
chick-fil-a that's right I don't know

273
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:46,340
what it is but cool kick ass chicken
sandwich coupons for chick-fil-a and I'm

274
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,240
insecure 11 security forever I'm
clicking that after I want free chicken

275
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,480
right so I know any fishing template
that don't fish move quickly I know any

276
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:04,399
phishing attempt to explain street food
I'm clicking right you if you know that

277
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:09,440
about your users you can say Raymond
abiu chick-fil-a just don't click on

278
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:17,549
free chick-fil-a once a week is never
click on it to get it also gives ability

279
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:24,519
some of the ability to the people the
report fishing right away so the school

280
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:31,380
says have ability to say I think this is
fishing let me go reported right

281
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,100
take a test for things like attachments
it will test for things like exultation

282
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,790
out of your network what kind of ports
can come out of your network by its

283
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,280
multilingual never tried it fishing
frenzy to go

284
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:54,790
Japanese Chinese right it's hard and
then you need to you need to have it

285
00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:01,630
translated by a real person not a
machine because she's always mess up on

286
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:09,010
the right now I would submit that if you
use Google translator so many people to

287
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:21,750
click because they could but if that
person who says it all this to happen

288
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:27,610
without losing the ability to pop in
later nobody says you can't see them

289
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:32,480
first forcing as a service first and if
it's in your contract the pop them in

290
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,280
only the popular something else right so
let's talk about setting up a fast

291
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:48,840
offering you can roll your own I roll my
own I'm lazy because forgotten that by

292
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,530
now it's too bad right like I said you
need your domain names right you need

293
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,810
your email templates you need your web
servers attract the clicks and exploits

294
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:05,600
right she need to think about all the
stuff we need logic to track all the

295
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,380
food before w's who what where when why
you need a way to track and record were

296
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,910
folks are geographically right we need
statistics and graphs about everything

297
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:25,300
possible right all doable and they all
have you know if you have the coding

298
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,310
expertise in the time and you're not
lazy sure you can do it there are tools

299
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,790
like fishing frenzy that will give you a
baseline the start doing things like

300
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:39,520
that if you really really want to look
at doing fast on your own look at lucy

301
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,810
Thai so they threw up

302
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:47,840
you can it has a lot of what we need to
get a faster version a fast service

303
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,000
running it's not the end all be all but
it's a start

304
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:07,380
think either is there are 12 fenderson
do this right the good thing about the

305
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,390
vendors and this is where I sound like a
commercial I don't want to sound

306
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,060
commercial again I'm not getting paid by
any of these folks but if they want to

307
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:22,350
pay me later we'll take it there are
folks that do all this for you right but

308
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:56,850
what's the problem with them doing it on
their own business is one and two

309
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,630
they're not they claim to be security
vendors they're not security even if you

310
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:09,640
look at any one of these products and
you can't do it without them because I'm

311
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,910
lazy and I will I work with but they
don't understand security you look on

312
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,340
their their job boards what it what is
it a programmer I need a roomie this and

313
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:26,290
that I needed why because they want to
make a better website right and they

314
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:32,080
want to make it easier for me to fish
from that website right they don't know

315
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,340
what really is going on in from the
security perspective they may have a

316
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,110
couple of the few security folks that
are kinda driving things but they're

317
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,880
primarily programming shops so them to
do alone in a lot of companies to use

318
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
these folks alone

319
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,140
you know coca cola for example would go
on by this line of fish me or whatever

320
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:01,940
or threats I mean SE K me once a month
why don't our clients like to do it why

321
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:07,330
why can't coca-cola go directly to
finish line and say I want some service

322
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:15,020
same type of problems they don't have
the staff to do all this right they're

323
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,320
putting bottles own thing for millions
what you know

324
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,050
coca-cola into those bottles they have a
special team their business they have a

325
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:27,140
core cyber security aspect right but as
I get around statistics in with their

326
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,520
security personnel know that in months
one when you have five picks in the

327
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,640
months to when you have 10 clicks that
it may be that in months to your doing a

328
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:42,420
better job although you had more clicks
right maybe you click but you have more

329
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:49,660
people reported to remove this mother's
is this so what I assume it is that we

330
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:56,650
work together right I use the vendors so
that I don't have to set up anything

331
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:01,900
they do all the templates I work with
them the same here templates sock or you

332
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:09,900
need more right so I'm giving them
feedback from my engagements say you

333
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,950
need to do this you need to do that you
need to do this

334
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:18,730
the good thing that I found so far is
that there are young enough in their in

335
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,680
their own career path for their own
company pat the UK influenced a lot of

336
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,580
change when you come back and you say I
just fish 9,000 people and this is what

337
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,700
I saw when your product broke down

338
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,080
used too much job when you did too much
stuff to listen to you ok Annie to do

339
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,080
the work with you on that and that gives
you better deals for next time you need

340
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,260
to do use them to do another fishing
camping right so together we can make a

341
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,710
great service offers for our clients
right we have everything we need we have

342
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,330
infrastructure to do it we have all
domains pre-registered

343
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,540
of all the templates ready to go we have
suffered will do the web service that

344
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:03,030
will take the statistics we have
everything right so we marry up with one

345
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:08,140
or more of these vendors we can start
providing fast as a service we from a

346
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,640
consultant side of the house right now

347
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,330
quiet out there the people that aren't
consultants consumer of this

348
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:20,400
organizations that have the security
authorities are working with people like

349
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,650
this they can offer you a fast servers
as you're gonna get a lot more

350
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,860
statistics out of it

351
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,460
thing going to them alone in going to
something that doesn't use them right so

352
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:36,710
it's been a marriage of both worlds
right when we get out of the building

353
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:43,180
that training right off the bat sunny
click something we have a pop of saying

354
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,780
you stupid fuck you can click that right
right off the bat we can say you click

355
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:55,060
that you're bad we can say well in this
email you should have seen the domain

356
00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:01,020
name was misspelled educational things
and this is kind of things you should

357
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,210
worry about right we can give them an
ability to report the fishing media

358
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:14,230
right if I think something is an attempt
and I don't have a process within a

359
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:19,110
company to work for that fishing right
what's my process I'm gonna send it over

360
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:27,740
lighty was I T gonna do it said he has a
fishing intent on doing so I can have

361
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,890
the ability to report the same and I
don't have to worry about doing any kind

362
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:40,630
of my friends and other friends it's
really easy to upload data into these

363
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:45,340
systems so now when I go to my client
actually don't give me an email list

364
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:50,409
give me an Excel spreadsheet has a month
the sex the gender you know the gender

365
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:56,040
the location the whatever Obama ball
down the row right so that way I can the

366
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,400
more you give me the more sadistic than
bill for you

367
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:09,289
right we did graphing ask you can do any
kind of graph you want to do so pick

368
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:16,160
your partner has pros and cons of each I
work with multiple so I don't have all

369
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,180
my eggs in one basket I think some do
things better than others I just started

370
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:39,500
having my communications with fish line
so I've used them before you need to

371
00:35:39,500 --> 00:36:03,700
throw templates on a good thing is when
you're done you got a good product which

372
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:10,700
is good but so when do a bit of a fast
walk through in case you guys are

373
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,150
familiar with it and what we can get out
these tools and working with the tools

374
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:21,130
and then when things are so before we
can also use these tools in the still do

375
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:27,380
the poppy we believe we learned so much
information about the users we can do

376
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:36,059
more later if we so choose this is
Vishal lines little first page and I

377
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:40,630
don't go down too many pages of any one
vendor because I don't want them to see

378
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:47,319
what other people do but here you little
campaign manager will be watching your

379
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:51,920
steps you had your people in you have
all your stuff into it right and you saw

380
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,599
your campaign using their tools right
somebody with other products

381
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:06,349
campaign you want to run we can do all
kinds of stuff using these tools

382
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:12,420
insulting the ability to have that
framework to use and then we can

383
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,870
leverage our knowledge

384
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:19,200
of fishing in education and working with
the clients to make that serve as a

385
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,960
better service so we can together with
them with the vendors we can make a

386
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,740
better service offering for our client's
right to 26 I left out what these were

387
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,930
because they had client names in there
so I'm sorry I forgot my call shit but

388
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:44,190
we could some bluegrass grass that's
really important reports right I think

389
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:50,120
blue was number email sent out you know
open clicked invulnerable

390
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:58,550
like that so we can get a bunch of
information about the users by this is

391
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:04,630
just one pop up from threats so here we
know who we know where we know what they

392
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,620
were vulnerable with

393
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:20,370
so we have Adobe Flash problems with
Internet Explorer 10 we have whether or

394
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:24,610
not they had ingress coming out of
office or not based on what we drop that

395
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:30,530
we sent them to see what port for coming
up so that I know who clicked on things

396
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:35,710
and who didn't click on things in this
example I said I actually do that how to

397
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:46,320
how to click but in this example nobody
actually put in credentials but if if if

398
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,360
they had I would know who put in their
credentials and threw it into a phishing

399
00:38:51,360 --> 00:39:00,010
web page so I was an attack her when we
do our fast if it is in our engagement

400
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:07,560
coat right we can then do the
penetration testing of this right what

401
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,320
am I gonna do it here

402
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:18,660
PDFs / you know I automatically have an
attack that can go after these people on

403
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,700
right if they had clicked it in the
inter the credentials I know I now know

404
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,780
who to do

405
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:31,730
credential Harvard right and you can get
those repeat offenders if you see so

406
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,690
many clicking it all the time and
putting their credentials and all the

407
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:42,130
time and it happens then you know that
your credentials from SBF 120 are going

408
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:49,910
to them what I want to end on this is my
last live so I want to end on one thing

409
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:56,200
is to gather us as consultants that no
understand the security side of house

410
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,150
and in the fishing side of house working
with these vendors can take us to the

411
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,870
next step in offer clients with a truly
need in that statistics and stuff and

412
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:11,380
everything now I use the term fast
because I don't think this is a one-time

413
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,340
soon forget

414
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:18,300
right this is not an engagement where
you you engage with IT consultant you

415
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,190
pay them X amount of dollars in sick
fish me right this is something where

416
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:28,370
you go to a consultant who say I want
you to kiss me from now until next year

417
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:34,430
and will reopen contract next year and I
went fishing at least twice a month and

418
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:40,270
I want reports generated a month or more
right now we want to work then this is a

419
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:47,460
continuous effort right and what the
continuous effort gives us it's a system

420
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:54,370
that we need to make it better right now
we can sell the San Francisco office cuz

421
00:40:54,370 --> 00:41:00,780
they never listen making someone else's
problem if Baltimore indicia are ok san

422
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,240
Francisco's not sell so extreme but
things happen

423
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,130
questions comments

424
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:45,450
my pricing model to my clients are
depends on the route I'm going if I went

425
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:50,030
to a fishing printing route here at this
time and then they built it on my own I

426
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:54,500
have investment hours into a product I
need to recoup that money and then I

427
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:00,420
need to get more money to keep the
development going alright if I use one

428
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,250
of the vendors I have to pay the vendor
each vendor has her own pricing model

429
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:13,350
right so we have the ability to say as a
vendor they could say is gonna cost you

430
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:26,330
$1000 of fish 250 people a month right
now you have to say for the twenty

431
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:32,870
people than $1,000 a month that equates
up to $12,000 a year then you need to

432
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,880
profit on top of that so let's say
you're cheap

433
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,380
charging twenty grand right off houses
going to the vendor 2004 doing the

434
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:51,020
reports right person company afford that
I would say yes if you went in there he

435
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,550
said it's gonna cost me 500 K because
you're greedy and you only pay the

436
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:00,190
vendor 12 hey I say it's wonderful the
company is not going to bite off so it's

437
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,620
really it's really a scale right some of
these vendors will want you sell their

438
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:10,830
product to the client right they don't
want to go through you to get the client

439
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:15,170
they want a client to buy so that when
the client by directly right and what

440
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:19,540
they do in that scenario will usually
give you points to view 20 percent of

441
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,910
the sale right now

442
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:29,119
coca-cola's my example right coca-cola
buys fish me as an example it doesn't

443
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,970
preclude you from money the scans for
common cold right you will get 20% of

444
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:41,089
what are your contractor rate with fish
me was for that sail to coca-cola and

445
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:44,109
then you would have to have a service
agreement with coca-cola to do the

446
00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:48,799
fishing for them and that's doable so
this piece like them buying the product

447
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:53,470
and I'm running the product for them and
I'm giving my expertise so sorry but

448
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:57,829
there's a distinct thanks a small
company I would probably do it the final

449
00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:23,890
minute that maybe pay per month and then
charged so I know that all my templates

450
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:27,529
and stuff like that I can do whatever I
want with them out of the room folks

451
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:32,049
that I've used but if you wanted through
I know that there are some out there

452
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:38,380
that say instead of it being fish line
it's you know Raymond fishing is all

453
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,900
going to depend on your relationship
with that blender and I would submit

454
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,690
that the more than getting out of the
that chunk the better author are gonna

455
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,760
have been rebranded

456
00:44:49,760 --> 00:45:09,970
absolutely so I had to keep saying all
depends it depends so the one advantage

457
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:16,200
of doing a fast type system is when when
they click something I can send them to

458
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:23,049
a link of my choice where it could be an
error message saying it could be a link

459
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:27,500
to training so they immediately when
they get fished when I click on that

460
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,180
chick flap when it comes to me

461
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:36,890
there's a video there's a game there's a
quiz there's the PDF to read there's

462
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,890
whatever so they're getting immediate
trading out out out of the actual

463
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:45,760
fishing itself as well but also on top
of that you can offer your own right and

464
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,140
before you write that contract and what
you will do for security and where his

465
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,770
training I would say do with fishing
exercise right this will give you a

466
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:00,420
complete understanding of what the
landscape looks like you don't do 12 a

467
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:06,320
campaign of several emails right so you
know that going in that statistically

468
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,970
50% of the company's clicks on a regular
basis versus 2% that will help you get

469
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:50,350
retraining goes so I showed little this
little fish belly button and you can

470
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:56,020
click on reporting and if it's a fish me
email that comes in

471
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:01,030
was from the fishing service and you
click the fish Me button it will say

472
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:06,500
congratulations you caught us so you get
a positive confirmation if it's another

473
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,500
fish when you send it to their you'll
get a generic message saying thank you

474
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:18,380
will look into this information you can
encourage companies do anything you want

475
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,440
right I like chick flick chick-fil-a
every time I don't click on a chick

476
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,680
flick link and I'm not thinking anything

477
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,890
we don't have those left by the way

478
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:38,570
doughnuts and I'm not clicking on the
right to you Tom food water and other

479
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:42,480
questions about it
