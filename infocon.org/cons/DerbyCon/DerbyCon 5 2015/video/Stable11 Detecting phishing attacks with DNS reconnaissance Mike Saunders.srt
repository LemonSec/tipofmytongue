1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,060
their undoing gender because no one here
for your first year because we're going

2
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,640
to talk about detecting and preventing
spear phishing attacks antennas and I

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,330
said before I realized spearfishing
might be more appropriate

4
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:38,390
speaker fact you can't advance the
slides yes USB connector is not a place

5
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,770
right

6
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,510
hey there we go alright so just let me
have an idea about seventeen years but

7
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,539
insecurity for about nine years I'm
standing on ice

8
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:54,059
Twitter handle hardware hacker that is
hard water that's the north country that

9
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,140
is hard water that's what I came from
I'm currently a pen tester but I come

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,579
from a long defender insisting mysteries
background so I'm talking about today

11
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,420
detecting and preventing phishing
attacks using DNS I'm talking about

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,950
problems title squatting so how many
here I'm sooo most you know about types

13
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,890
wanting anyone not know what I was
getting us okay so I'm talking about the

14
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,119
kinds of type of squatting that are
specifically dealing with misspell

15
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,590
domain names or using like Hamid lives
where you have characters that look like

16
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,520
other characters there's another kind of
type of squatting that would be like

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,079
hibernating characters together so like
Service Desk paypal.com updates dash

18
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,500
microsoft.com it's a different kind of
that we're dealing with the

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,370
intentionally misspelled why is that men

20
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,790
drug samples out yesterday I thought it
was appropriate if you send it they will

21
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,040
click that's true right

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,620
our users are not trained especially
with these with these type of squatting

23
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,000
domain names that are misspelled using
home unless they're very difficult to

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,700
detect when you first look at him for
something as his professionalism and

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,199
hard for us to see see it on first
glance and as a result our users don't

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,660
know they get an email the thing so it's
legit and then click on it and now the

27
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,160
attackers got

28
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,230
credentials they might have a shell in
your system doesn't matter how good your

29
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,470
department of defense is there now on
your network obviously a lot of

30
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,380
motivations bout type of squatting back
in the day was about advertising

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,920
financial kinds of things redirecting
through ad networks delivering malware

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,410
but then it really started getting used
for phishing attacks it is highly

33
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,410
affected and I have some examples of
kinds of type of squatting on the screen

34
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:47,660
hear things like repeating characters
google.com with 3 O's or things like

35
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,350
omitted characters amazon.com missing
you also have the things like missing

36
00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:02,350
dots so www.microsoft.com vs
www.microsoft.com Dec find out or vs

37
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:08,580
DEFCON dot org filters we also use
things like making something singular or

38
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,989
plural or exchanging vows around there's
one called how phones which are words

39
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:19,030
that sound a leg not really useful and
fishing its next one that is very useful

40
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,120
is homeless again characters that look
like other characters using an eye in

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,310
place of an L or using a winner Ellen
place of an eye and soaked up the wrong

42
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,220
TLD whitehouse.gov right

43
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:41,810
you guys know you also have things like
different country code swapping the TLD

44
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,080
to be like evil Corp dots p.m. instead
of ppl Corp dot com these are different

45
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,860
kinds of title squatting that are highly
effective and phishing attacks something

46
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,470
to show you a couple of the couple of
examples a traditional texts body right

47
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,500
now we have things like real world
examples twitter.com is the type of

48
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,970
squatting for profit

49
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,700
advertising Tesla Motors dot com evolved
swab and its advertising you can see

50
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:18,680
here you click on the ads for generating
money in the case of Microsoft I want to

51
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,520
make her soft and i ended up at stored
at hp.com after bouncing through a bunch

52
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:32,940
of advertising networks in the case of
low as 10 I ended up after bus

53
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,060
advertising networks know these are your
trips all kinds of typos squad the

54
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,010
question is are we seeing these kinds of
type of squatting use in real-world

55
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,580
phishing attacks with real-world cases
the answer is absolutely yes things like

56
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,300
anthem and Permira we all heard about
him earlier this year

57
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,140
very large attacks and analysis after
the fact

58
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,040
pointed to some common actors and some
common things happened one there was

59
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,910
type US productivity and to register
they were used in testing attacks in

60
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,740
case of anthem least you as well . this
foreign services under wellpoint dot com

61
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,390
and there was a domain registered W E 11
point dot com list had to type of

62
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:18,160
squatting in the case of Premera there
was a domain registered in there I dot

63
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,110
com two ends in a lot of browsers and in
a lot of email clients depending on your

64
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,450
using two ends looks very much like a
single and more recently CareFirst

65
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,260
BlueCross breeze and they had care flirt
with an L and CareFirst with the water

66
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,600
so these are definitely happening in the
real world with real it

67
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,090
real implications write this case it
didn't happen

68
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,880
a researcher Paul Moore tweeted this out
and this looks like Lloyds Bank UK I

69
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,340
mean that looks like to else I looked at
it I couldn't figure out what was wrong

70
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,910
with it at first there to capitalize not
to lower his house in the only

71
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,260
difference if you would put these side
by side is that the capital I like one

72
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,420
pixel heavier is just slightly wider and
some funds then the lowercase L I don't

73
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,900
know the season security professional
indeed be able to tell you what's wrong

74
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,790
with it without doing some more analysis
so type of squatting can when combined

75
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:24,450
fishing taxes highly effective and it's
a defender what can you do about it

76
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,600
what tools are available to you well
there's your all crazy mutual written by

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,590
and recording it's a really cool that's
included with Callie and backtrack and

78
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,300
works as you get a domain name and it
generates possible title squatting

79
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,900
variations for that domain you have some
more recently more senior cows kiro a

80
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:51,900
tool called DNS twist in its Python tool
that does a lot of the same things you

81
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,980
get a domain name and it generates
output

82
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:00,580
both these tools do one thing that you
can use as a defender they have the

83
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,760
ability to tell you if a domain name is
registered or not

84
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,300
sofa domain name is registered I can run
these tools I can collect the output in

85
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,440
five days from now I can run this from
these tools am i doing again and I

86
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,040
collect the output in a different and I
see are there different registrations so

87
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,290
my demands example.com five days from
now I see examples dot com what does

88
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:32,000
that mean so you can do it but it's kind
of clunky its manual it's not anything

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,380
that works I mean it's just not easy
right so I wrote it to all cuz after

90
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,900
looking around I didn't see anything but
I wrote a school called crazy parser

91
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,980
because the time only you were all crazy
existed Python to all and it consumes

92
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,880
the output of both DNS twists and you
were all crazy and it will compare that

93
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,530
against a baseline that you will set up
to be able to detect did a new domain

94
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,260
get registered since the last time
around the program so that way and

95
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,910
attackers registering the domain in
advance the attack you can see that

96
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,910
registration and you can have a chance
to possibly at least prepare yourself

97
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,180
you may not be able to stop it because
there's not enough time you're not

98
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,980
prepared it is good to know that it's
going to happen to me show you how it

99
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:27,849
works it's configured and show you
actually what happens right so

100
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:36,180
can see that here when you download
files you get crazy parser you can have

101
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,409
smaller files known domains that
seriously in my tummy is jesse is she

102
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,729
will talk about those in minute first
thing I want to do is show you what's in

103
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:51,000
crazy parser that you need to modify
this is horrible ok so it talks about

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:13,410
dependencies we see that we've got URL
crazy little too big for yes we need to

105
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,230
tell the program where these programs
live so i knows how to use them right

106
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:24,209
underneath the imports are two variables
URL crazy path and DNS twist path just

107
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:28,329
point to where they exist on your system
you're in Cali year old he's already

108
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,519
cracked just point where they're at

109
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,120
that's all you would need to do to start
using the program for modification this

110
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:41,750
there are few command line arguments
available if you run without any

111
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,029
arguments will see those we have things
like dashed see that house where the

112
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,959
configuration directory is well-known
demands that serious he might slip

113
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,850
that's the important things seem to be
the director you're running from unless

114
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,649
you tell it they live somewhere else

115
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,459
dashiell was what file as we see the
results in defaults to results

116
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:04,730
Dashti is a directory where you save
those results can assume you're

117
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,959
Directory directory unless you specify
otherwise

118
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,850
and then there's dash MNE and that
allows you to send an email so if you go

119
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:21,639
and look at crazy parser look forward to
seeing here it tells you that you just

120
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,569
need to configure user name password and
recipient if you're using Gmail it can

121
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:31,240
it's already setup to relay through
Gmail username and your application

122
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,800
specific password putting recipients and
it'll send an email when it's done if

123
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,680
there are no new results says everything
is clear and if there are no results

124
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,060
she'll put file to the email and I have
a chance to review it if you're not

125
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,460
using Gmail just go down here to mail
server depose and say your mail server

126
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,740
appropriately so that you have your
internal details for your mail server

127
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,360
and that's all you need to do to using
male alright so there are two other

128
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,410
files right there's a CSV files in the
first one is my domains CSV formats the

129
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,470
domains that you want to monitor for
phishing attacks or type of squatting

130
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,740
attacks against right so it's gonna say
example.com so it's saying we're

131
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,920
monitoring for your become.com so we put
that in there now if we had another

132
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:32,330
demand that we wanted to monitor defense
is so it's a binary defense systems that

133
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:40,720
2010 company doesn't even know let's
pretend it's this right so you can put

134
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,230
one or more demands in here you can put
as many as you want one per line we're

135
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:54,000
just gonna do do become so you're also
gonna have known domains that CSV and

136
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,709
when you first open it up it says
examples dot com and WTF example.com

137
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:04,740
this just shows you how the file works
the first time you run it though we're

138
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:15,140
just gonna leave it empty and let's see
what I talked two options so there's DNS

139
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,910
twisting around crazy and that tells you
to use either one program or the other

140
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:34,170
programmer role so alright so what's
gonna happen here the networks working

141
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:41,480
yes that crazy parser calls both DNS
twists and you're all crazy they're

142
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,740
going to do what they do with the domain
term become.com they're going to do

143
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,800
their lookups going to determine what
domains are registered for sharing that

144
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,060
information super sturdy duplicate that
so we have one master list and then it

145
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,680
can save the results file the reason we
cleared out the non demands files

146
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,279
because that's like your whitelist tell
it things we've already seen so with it

147
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:11,430
empty everything it sees is new so it's
going to run gonna do is look at what's

148
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,630
new already undergoing a file called
results that CSV which will contain any

149
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:30,810
type of squatting domains order because
I dot com that currently exists today is

150
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,300
the day going to work

151
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:40,910
tempting I didn't kill any money goes
alright there's no eres here so let's

152
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:47,990
look what's in results that CSV alright
it worked so now we see that have a

153
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:55,470
number of domains Debbie conduct com
Derby khou.com Derby coin dot com you

154
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,150
know things like that so these are all
the demands it actually exists that our

155
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:05,400
type of squatting alternatives for Derby
kind of calm so we need to do is we need

156
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,830
to review these

157
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:13,310
we need to review these demands and we
need to determine what is their intent

158
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,880
what is their purpose so what I would do
as I would go to each domain and I'd use

159
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,580
a non attributable admin vem that's art
something that's outside my network

160
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,290
because if it is a phishing attack you
don't want to tell people that you're on

161
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,020
them she uses something is outside your
network ghosts are looking at these

162
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,430
domains and figure out whether they do
or they just traditional squatters are

163
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,780
doing advertising see that a lot

164
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,830
all kinds of just trying to get people
that miss type on the keyboard summer

165
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,650
gonna be a legitimate with business
websites Derby khou.com is Debian

166
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,550
company and some if you actually had a
phishing attack who knows what it's

167
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,520
going to look like right it may be
blamed for the shooting in prep stage

168
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:58,880
maybe they use something like set to
near the page and if you if you go to

169
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,890
one of these type of squatting
alternatives and it's your site that's

170
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,660
when you know that something bad is
about to happen so you need to know

171
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,600
configure crazy purser to know about the
things that you want you don't wanna

172
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,860
know about anymore and you do that by
using this file you got to make common

173
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,530
reason you put in a domain and then a
comment and this reason isn't actually

174
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,950
important it's just for you to use hi
everyone I tend to use a valid site and

175
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:32,210
squatter but you can use your blogger
ticketing system and record the details

176
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,780
about that domains help you understand
why decision in your record the incident

177
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,990
number here you could do that whatever
you want to just know that crazy party

178
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,890
doesn't use it you just need domain com
account so hard to classify this I went

179
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:52,840
looked and said that Derby Derby hull is
a valid website to calm and conduct net

180
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,550
is a squatter site is not actually about
what you notice they don't have their

181
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,980
behind at Oregon here and the reason is
were pretending that it hasn't been

182
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:09,050
registered yet it doesn't exist so once
we see this file will be run again

183
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:15,450
using the same arguments is gonna do it
same thing it's gonna call her crazy

184
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,290
gonna call DNS twist they're gonna do
they look up to return the results but

185
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,390
this time it's going to look at known
domains does she is fancy does this

186
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,050
entry exists if it does it's also crazy
person hey this is good we've already

187
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:32,860
seen that we don't want to know about it
anymore so the only thing that's going

188
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,019
to exist when you're done in the results
file our demands that didn't exist

189
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,560
the last time you read it baseline so
you can use this and continuous

190
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,980
monitoring mode to sit there and monitor
for attacks on you can run it once had a

191
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:55,170
baby run it once an hour if you use a
large number of domains it takes a while

192
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,519
to run right now there is a bug that if
you run it more often than it takes to

193
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,319
continue our to finish executing it'll
clobber its temporary files and never

194
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,030
finished executing so that will be fixed
I didn't see it already I would

195
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:14,530
definitely use both DNS twists and URL
crazy DNS twist is still under active

196
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:20,360
development and it has a ways to go to
catch up but it is getting close it's

197
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,110
it's very good and you will find things
that the other one didn't find now that

198
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:31,510
we're done running let's look if this
worked during conduct or sets the only

199
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,500
thing in the results file that means a
derby car door it was registered since

200
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,110
the last time we have to get a baseline
which means there's probably a phishing

201
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,330
attack that's about happen if this if
this site after analysis isn't just an

202
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:54,020
ad squatter alright so the demo you see
how it works what he do afterwards right

203
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,000
you need to do some preventative
measures are needed a funny cat pics so

204
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,800
is every talk has to have blocked the
domains in your web proxy if they're not

205
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,530
valid sites even if they're just
advertising sites you don't know that

206
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,429
they're not going to deliver some kind
of malicious add a week a month a year

207
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,820
from now supply kit in your proxy

208
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,080
made you want a black hole TNS no one in
your networking get to it

209
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,759
increase your monitoring look for those
fishing domains coming in in emails are

210
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,700
those type of squatting is coming in and
email scams that means an attack is

211
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:36,690
happening so there are some drawbacks
hear it works in certain situations and

212
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,870
doesn't in others in the case of
WellPoint dot com I wanted to know what

213
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,889
anthem have seen this attack ensuring of
crazy our URL crazy detects it they

214
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:49,899
would have had a warning that this
domain was registered case of Panera

215
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:54,980
with double and glittering M was not
detected but it is now I submitted a

216
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,509
request for CNN is included in DNS twist
hair forrest was fifty 50 ml cliff was

217
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:06,470
was detected the one left when I was not
but West Midnapore request and it is in

218
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,669
there now it will not detect those
hyphenated demands that we're talking

219
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,620
about things like Service Desk
paypal.com it is just not set up to do

220
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,850
that it's not gonna protect your
external users our customers are people

221
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,990
who are outside your network boundary
but you do have some options there to

222
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,299
WIPO the World Intellectual Property
Organization has something called you

223
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:33,409
know universal domain name dispute
resolution policy that allows you to

224
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:39,090
petition to seize that domain if it's
someone that's trying to profit off your

225
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,409
brand someone is trying to keep you from
try steel business from me whatever it

226
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,419
is or they're attacking you

227
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,779
usne cybersquatting Consumer Protection
Act is also available at this link here

228
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:55,809
for I can if you're interested in making
bail for afterwards tells you how to

229
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:59,960
file the legal proceedings the
documentation you need to seize a domain

230
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,120
this type of squatting with that the
code on GitHub I'm hard water hacker on

231
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,909
Twitter my email address is out here in
the slides will be on my blog her

232
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,470
daughter sector blogspot.com

233
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,799
you guys been great this my first time
speaking at Derby and you are awesome

234
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:21,120
and I want to thank you for being here
it and are there any questions

235
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:52,390
sure you know there yes to the question
is like is there any way to find things

236
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,370
when demands are registered really fast

237
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,809
this isn't gonna work things like anthem
though that WellPoint domain was

238
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:03,429
registered well ahead of the attack that
actually started they started building

239
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,900
they're proud she was going to catch the
ones where they're doing big prepping

240
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,460
for him but it's if they register a
domain and restart the TAC the only

241
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,730
thing you could do is schedule it to run
every 15 minutes in hope that you can

242
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,110
respond and the remaining 45 and there's
one other question we got one minute

243
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:38,260
left I don't drink man sorry if it was
warm red well I told will be on it

244
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:45,860
yea again if if you don't have much time
there's not much you can do it it's

245
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,740
depends on how fast can respond if
they're preparing out in front you have

246
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,050
a better chance I am working however on
the way to do some of these kinds of

247
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:01,310
detection on the wire hoping to release
something for bro maybe someday bro

248
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:06,150
signature and I'm hoping to do is talk
and that in future so keep an eye out

249
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,660
think I got to get going here I'm
getting cut so do you have any questions

250
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,440
I'll be in the hallway outside
