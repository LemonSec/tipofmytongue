1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,379
by the video everyone wants what's your
new Chromebook to represent bring you

2
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,580
gonna let that happen but we still see
mussah screenshots and things heat and

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:31,130
shouted out now I'll explain a little
more migrants so this is my presentation

4
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:37,809
Jeremy Browne personal biases not too
familiar and VirtualBox essential

5
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:42,440
abstract not too familiar with no
different forms of them how they were

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:51,379
never heard the word you know more about
it soon so gentle eyes to the

7
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:55,530
introduction of events and public
examples this presentation has a lot of

8
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,620
bugs and heavily show you some of the
different analysis techniques and you'll

9
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,140
you'll see various security things
throughout but there's a ton of bugs in

10
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,490
this summer fix topics such a page and
she makes on Sunday so few gems

11
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,470
scattered throughout I'm going to some
of the newer blog so these are some bugs

12
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,619
of town for the last few months my
research with the various categories

13
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:27,830
some document accounting document
accounts password litter is really

14
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,060
interesting one in the space virtual a
biosecurity and show you where to go

15
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,630
from here

16
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,720
how vendors can simply terrific season
and at that point should get a pretty

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,630
good understanding of how to

18
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:53,890
so many researchers formerly Microsoft
Windows Xbox to television center for

19
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,570
that ass over to temple for a while

20
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:02,009
gentleman here last season

21
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:11,400
colleagues unnecessary plugin simple
things like that though first of all I'm

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,750
not talking about not talking about when
bugs that don't directly to a shell also

23
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,420
not the images the stuff you look at our
have the keys for before you start

24
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,349
looking for bucks when I'm going to talk
about his emotions that's everyone's

25
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:39,180
favorite thing to the Malaysian man
ejection back to our talents and then

26
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,950
once we have a show that is not already
route escalating to root and there's

27
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,680
another interesting bugs to go see along
the way so what is emerging science

28
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,480
course you can figure out a visible
prices of the violence has taken that

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,120
visible clients and converting it to
example of an image for something you

30
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,840
can stall hypervisor and run in a
datacenter or run in the various being

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,940
software that you get off the shelf just
literally in an operating system all

32
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,980
software hardware virtualization

33
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,200
so the examples here are like physical
sciences given buxom ethernet jacks

34
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,700
usually restricted functionality and
everything 24 contract or otherwise

35
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,180
you'll find more like kale is just dumb
bawling figure all the devices software

36
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:39,940
to distribute as avian image and is
really becoming popular these days

37
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:47,730
things are moving more to bigger metal
and moving more from smaller devices to

38
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,400
data centers and cloud and all that
stuff and when interest including this

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,489
one reference on the bottom

40
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:59,799
applications no longer need to be
shipped across national borders pretty

41
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,230
interesting thought about that is
actually a purge of having be able to

42
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,819
download were personally received
something over the internet rather than

43
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:16,199
having to have it inspected at the
border 0 there was something they're

44
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,979
really getting maybe more other
countries that are you looking to have

45
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:32,139
sex with her gold prices whenever
shipped these bugs are universal

46
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,500
throughout everything shipped so it's
not something that are created provision

47
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,050
you don't need to install any apps for
these two Korean I install Adobe Reader

48
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:47,789
all these other things that are there
probably really explode through third

49
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:55,090
party apps on iOS everything we're doing
looking at the security of the device

50
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,080
upon saw and seeing what's available and
what is your assumptions made from there

51
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,169
was a popular vendors for these and
they're becoming more and more vendors

52
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:14,139
are are buying into this this way to
distribute the prices of EMC HP anything

53
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,390
about it

54
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:22,320
ASAP is they had a lot of different
trials and demos their own cloud on you

55
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,940
can actually get your hands on the on
the image to look at so I think so after

56
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,300
that I really like to have some time
with us if you divide and I wasn't too

57
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,410
well mccloud

58
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,500
birth month buttoning up across are
usually likely to say share along the

59
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,880
same code and the common models among
vendors at this point they still soon

60
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,380
for a lot of this device is you usually
don't i mean they may not have so you

61
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,480
can't meander around the operating
system as you like

62
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,320
so the compound leading to see Bieber
comprises as long as you can get root

63
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,830
later they enable and another bug so it
isn't being reason to ship a welcoming a

64
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,220
litter box just think they've left on
the box or not they probably shouldn't

65
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,770
they soon someone else and have access
to and I really funny thing about this

66
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,240
is you know when you buy something and
you have a problem or know all these

67
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,140
enterprise devices in the movie pretty
deeply in the industry I T or otherwise

68
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,710
even configure their first album
sometimes you literally spend a lot of

69
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,210
time looking documentation and trying to
figure out how to install this thing so

70
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,580
you really make support calls with love
these trials are there you get them

71
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:52,770
otherwise really gonna friends device or
something like that but anyway so why

72
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,700
would anyone go to these price
especially if your final exam on

73
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:05,320
yourself why the commission for
prevalence steadily gained popular you

74
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,980
can see a lot of physical devices and
vendors are offering to see both either

75
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,770
the physical shipped to you or allow any
link to download the virtual at you

76
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:20,060
purchase order whatever way and I'm
going ok entertainment all of this in a

77
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,660
bit and also that I

78
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,420
entertainment person like to show you
just how these are actual bugs these are

79
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:35,050
just funny things that I thought I found
along the way so I can read the names of

80
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,360
some you know ask about later but OK
members which was really awesome these

81
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,930
are 44 was fertile minds like here's one
for example literally the close of these

82
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:52,260
is here's the image of our PC Taylor let
B bash istry long been known post on the

83
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,700
device relation of isolation so just
kind of fun to look at and see who

84
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,800
they're talking to what commands are
doing many other interesting and

85
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,140
password that later on and in this ones
like just leaving in the configuration

86
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:16,260
files with urbana staller not just like
passwords there this one just around

87
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:22,060
more passengers will pass words
literally across the system isn't really

88
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,550
good so you know the common things like
hard only passwords in the in the long

89
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,390
house and I can just imagine this guy
was like ok only the password you know

90
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:37,010
I'll just hashes behind while he ought
to do

91
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,690
popular run it through a rainbow tables
system Andrea cluster password so that's

92
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,940
one that said marks I don't have any
plans for the long haul all your

93
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:58,330
passwords are rather table has herds
some of these like this one day is a

94
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:05,270
single server server server on the
system and Dottie passes left in the

95
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,490
system so it's not only the local even
just

96
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,850
password long talking to the database
and I really bugs you access remotely

97
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:23,840
like that but filmed entertainment wise
and password from a remote server only

98
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,889
works in war

99
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:32,470
but they were there trying to download a
password-protected file his website that

100
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:41,489
Indian saw your ok reading the text on
the screen and a little small but comes

101
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:52,600
up I'll continue to regurgitate what I
can see as well it's a little small and

102
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:00,309
they're just internal IBM I hope
original plans so you can see them SFTP

103
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:05,730
in with the internal internal servers
just becuase they forgot to delete this

104
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:18,999
when the ship that this is nothing in
2001 I D Banar I don't understand why

105
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:24,269
anyone would ever sued I had to be there
had to be some checking that I was like

106
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,379
the half around whatever checkbook low
if it thinks its rude it'll continue so

107
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:37,279
there's no point so nothing
entertainment given to members of rival

108
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:49,389
get into the more detail stuff so
obviously is using Enterprise and you

109
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:53,269
can see that all times customers really
want to bug fix things they're buying a

110
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:59,839
lot of money for don't want you should
bring them a plan that has to count on

111
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,410
in your shipping all these latter left
on the system

112
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:15,899
something even more special and this is
a wonderful place where the instructions

113
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:23,039
were ok here's here's user password this
user has to rise and everything changed

114
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:30,750
never talks about it randomly generating
on install and that it's just really

115
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,870
it's really just about overtures here's
an image just go play within figured out

116
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:45,500
kinda looks like in the AM when you get
the actual pile so and how these things

117
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,860
is the question on the website
immediately for future trial evaluation

118
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:58,420
for demos you guys to make a purchase to
make an investment that way

119
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:06,760
budget has devised be able to make a
living someone else that would make a

120
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,310
big investment and another just not
available

121
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,250
super knowing where you see this really
juicy morsel there's not a way to buy

122
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,010
shares you have to have yet to be either
be accompanied that some support

123
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:33,830
contracts in some way you just cannot be
individually so far so good

124
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,540
public examples either some of the
things that there are two public that is

125
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,500
all her were try to get you in the mood
for these devices in social web app

126
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,610
light hurts our reputation appliance
there is a there was an ejection found a

127
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,350
couple years ago we're on the interface
can insert commands and you're all

128
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:04,080
primary and this was supposedly fixed in
2013 and earlier this year's actually

129
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,860
still works so there's there's an
advisory by the way its second silver

130
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:17,290
and in the Niger the show really
detailed hotline and I think it was

131
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,520
fixed at this point I should they were
confirmed that but like I said I tested

132
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,280
earlier this year in the steel actually
works

133
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,310
transactions of this web plans on past

134
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,200
also there's there's a hardened her
artworks and books

135
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:43,830
customers and BTW and processing stuff
so it's a way to get some work done how

136
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,130
do I just bought the developer system
but if you think about internally how

137
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:54,970
many companies use this internally and
set up these devices I mean if you're in

138
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:03,950
a Pinterest renting it may be doing on
the networks really bad and they don't

139
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:10,360
encourage you to do anything i mean big
Ramya grants password as your privileges

140
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,800
and if you look at one of presentations
about setting these up talk about

141
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:23,660
sending Syria is hard to tell sometimes
the security stuff we know but some of

142
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,470
these boxes up his sleeve honorable so
you start that Pius anyone who knows

143
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:39,550
when they're so most of the things I'm
looking for in some of the things that

144
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:48,960
you can find these so here's a video
over not found and says some of 6 from

145
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:57,260
around six and going through it before
that has one else is home to one so I

146
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,430
wanted to look at how I did my purse to
it so dynamic view about dynamic and

147
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,950
static you talk about this so system
which is what you get

148
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:14,670
load 2 p.m. image into the hypervisor oh
yes I'll be a follower of a package

149
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,490
comes in

150
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:22,610
PhD you look up and discovered
limitations here if you don't if you

151
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,920
don't have to root for the Shelby you
have a slowdown in kind of prevents you

152
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:36,180
from looking at some of the things that
it is motivation to find a static view

153
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,399
no video is just emerging the robot
system did you give these packages of

154
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:50,290
you usually comes in a vs which is
dinner for the drive that all the stuff

155
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,020
installed on the image and if you
convert those images to house system and

156
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,370
then you look at it using an immature or
forensic software some sort

157
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,510
you can just look at the file system you
can download files from ang you can look

158
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,370
interesting things like the shadow house
party has on it

159
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,490
house there you can use regex to search
the file system to look for interesting

160
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:20,540
patterns other passwords other things
that they made no one of shit there or

161
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,080
maybe they're installing such thing
that's interesting

162
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,790
of the limitation here that I got me a
couple times was the first new scripts

163
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:38,339
so one example I was looking at a an
image I have a mother's remote right

164
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:45,980
here they have this account and password
every document and then I ran the first

165
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,920
boot OS installed the configuration for
the appliance and I went away they

166
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,230
changed the password somehow and
tracking down gets a little hard to

167
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:02,940
because everywhere and they do it all
these ways and sometimes you can find

168
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,350
them sometimes you can see what they
should password cracking has a point

169
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,339
specially if it's a complex password is
whatever they said that whenever the

170
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,439
password is it was not generated by null
and I don't think he's showing you are

171
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,970
too maybe one that's pretty rare but
that's the way to do it that's universal

172
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,440
across some account of their that has
some crazy password and if you can

173
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,160
figure it out anyway just got a remote

174
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:45,740
document the smallest are all in Cisco
paging server appliance its OEM software

175
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:54,060
single single our software there's this
one there's an exhibition game in a web

176
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,330
man and a web interface the first to
change and web man they share obviously

177
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:05,160
share the same indication system and the
last one the separate so what happens

178
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,730
when you change the fat man and men
password for the web interface logically

179
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,630
it doesn't change the first two now in
the documentation when it does you

180
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,660
changed my password it only refers to
the web interface so even even if there

181
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,770
is there's two separate systems here so
you only change one and he never talks

182
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:33,580
about the web manner or shell so even
though the password is changeme you will

183
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:43,240
never change it unless unless you just
want to call this is bad but they never

184
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:50,590
mentioned to do this change me and yet
men no matter how many times you change

185
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,840
the web interfaces password so you can
write it down as documentation bug

186
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,540
whatever go on a bender paging service
no one's gonna change the password was

187
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:15,100
like next 1 p.m. see power either
virtual pilot discusses the towns are

188
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,900
undocumented so

189
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:26,580
Tenzin s PC users service user and
passwords by throwing a dictionary

190
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:37,830
optimism everyone does your password
password is password is no so just log

191
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,280
in and things that have web banner
Shelby you can log on to the web

192
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,740
interface with this and undocumented
account I never did finish crashing

193
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,760
as PC users password although when I
talked to in see they did remove both

194
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,130
the users so maybe this made a really
complex password for each user I didn't

195
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,860
find it impossible anywhere but this is
this is one example and it really

196
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:09,190
actually faster on that next month I'm
view 5 p.m. today

197
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,390
SmartCloud monitoring student test the
official version this this is just

198
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,670
misses on testing official version of
this is not doing just that child called

199
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,030
out just in case something may be
different cuz I didn't test the other

200
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:29,150
one but there's six users on the system
that have a shells too much are

201
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:43,570
documented as idea user one GB and so
they have other users with the password

202
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,429
smartly they don't talk about these at
all so these are to the user password in

203
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:53,390
the documentation but aren't talked
about themselves so there's a remote

204
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:59,520
shell on the star club housing so this
one

205
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:07,270
rise in mobile manager Roberto plants V
mark no privacy of others user called in

206
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,740
him

207
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:18,620
undocumented she'll actually reported
this one too but I did some information

208
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,470
VMware contacted me I create ago so
you're doing talk to become one of the

209
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:33,250
top maybe more stuff so yeah I was like
no more gonna do they want you I please

210
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,080
send e-mails secure if you ask me I'll
tell you all the information

211
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,390
three days ago about this one caveat
with this one

212
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:48,290
the product is actually in the life
pretty soon November this year ago and

213
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:54,090
had more time but that did not have 131
although I did like the release notes

214
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,950
there was nothing about security of days
so pretty sure that still works 131 is

215
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:10,559
investigating this now and just be like
two months customers an interesting

216
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,169
fella pass out of everyone looks solid
matches what's going on these days for

217
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:29,140
various reasons the Seven Network's they
they operate in MS system and companies

218
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:40,640
like them and use them but they're so
when I found another underpin documented

219
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:52,260
CMC Dr user name password and it also
around the system and there is a superb

220
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,190
on air defense look up some customers
and if you have a large first argument

221
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:04,190
constraint of stackoverflow.com so on
medications on stuff even consider that

222
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,299
privilege escalation to be on the safe
side

223
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:14,340
exploit about her phone so i didnt
surged receiving yards

224
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,529
wanted to make sure you're not you
didn't come out and it's not actually

225
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:25,700
document account so did a search release
notes for a later version on some random

226
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,110
website and he had been removed

227
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:38,679
not even seven website and there he took
it down but thankfully and were able

228
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:40,450
still see what it was

229
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:48,740
so read it bud vase their team remove
shell access for CMC Dr user the next 18

230
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,410
hours ago

231
00:23:49,410 --> 00:24:02,530
corrected an issue so pretty big issue
so this is for just 34 35 36 and it was

232
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:08,060
apparently 60538 and I can only assume
they did some can test drive for their

233
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,910
release and arco you guys a lot of bugs
here and they just released it and can

234
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:19,670
even download games download 538 like I
guess if your customer hopefully you can

235
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:30,970
just weird timing issue before they
completely removed everything you own

236
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:42,790
timers here are still around a little
bit this is in SolarWinds IT manager he

237
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:49,220
commanded you give it a percent P memory
dress and not think well that's not

238
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,530
exploitable well probably hard but
there's 2005 paper about that

239
00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:05,560
about exploiting pressing issues in Perl
and Python logging a manager Cisco Prime

240
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:19,370
infrastructure from this one simple
Management Branch data center so if you

241
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:28,380
look if you go to a binary Adam is like
right now but I'll just get a full use

242
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:36,130
of their 67th about its so that should
strike you as a lot normally maybe

243
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:43,740
there's like twenty years thirty on the
system's 67 over double ring the bell

244
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:51,480
so if you just great for sale and have
the names of these commands there is one

245
00:25:51,480 --> 00:26:00,720
hundred you command named ron shelton
man run shell as they do what they do

246
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,280
with their names just so I know you hear
this but it also allows one to give you

247
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,679
a picture of the silly season he'll look
at what what the code looks like as

248
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:18,370
running the shell and how and i dont im
not trying to bash on this is really

249
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:24,510
written if you don't give it an argument
they don't even check if there's not

250
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:29,690
given so they really know anyone to run
this goes if you just gonna try to be

251
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:44,750
helped off it will enter the code
quality what to expect

252
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:55,930
Bernard analysis and a real programs
were given argument maybe don't do

253
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:02,370
something cool so it reads our mistrust
I'll and as you would expect from shells

254
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,140
route command as root

255
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:14,110
disambiguation but what about the rent
check man yeah it does it even easier

256
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:19,790
something to do with their scripts like
him better like that that you said

257
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:25,480
something like that but I gotta give him
they really stepped up security they are

258
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:35,730
only available to the root user and
group so you know that's that's really

259
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:42,050
good but then helping we have another
about area that we can run as root

260
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:48,060
exploit for this one when you when you
have a shelter system to escalate

261
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:53,870
privileges just you run shell commands
which is soon and execute command and

262
00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:05,110
give yourself to the next one another's
let us know you're going to get them

263
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:10,860
mixed up and it's really frankly nothing
I can do about that I don't I can't

264
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,270
change the names but there's a lot of
Cisco Prime virtual appliances even

265
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,120
leukocytes later if you're interested
which bugs pertained to particular ones

266
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,810
so there's to count on the system and a
root password is set up on the snow and

267
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:32,420
a CDM user password is only read up on
log does just that

268
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:41,920
p.m. user password is only reset the
password to see him user you may say

269
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,520
well I really bug calls log in I'm gonna
run Minnesota something else

270
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,669
well never log in

271
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:54,539
what if you just said the personal bias
and you're like outta here this later

272
00:28:54,539 --> 00:29:00,669
would never use the same user account
maybe just use it so i dont wanna

273
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:07,289
exploitable think we're the case study
so going on the issue of ok we can get a

274
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,429
shell with seem user or whatever
whenever either way there's an

275
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:19,480
interesting year old firewall just what
that does so there's there's another

276
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:26,989
service running on the system that is
what I am Sam her engine is a Java book

277
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:35,330
server so you guys ever looked at Java
boxer or heard of that it was murdered a

278
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:46,190
few years ago I mean like death was
because I like they did a bunch of stuff

279
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:53,049
on it so basically you get a remote root
in Java books are running a lesser maybe

280
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:57,299
there's some crazy Gration but you need
to find other bug server even turning

281
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:04,600
into root and so we can we can run
exploit locally whatever but just turn

282
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:11,440
the firewall that as it turned off
because we have this review discusses so

283
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:20,039
we knew that and then run the place they
provided by lactis we can get remotes

284
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:29,090
concerns so remember using Java bugs are
here is the link for the attn said you

285
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:40,139
ever see attn system check that box or
if it is you have to remember you only

286
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,940
live once

287
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:48,610
so there's also more interested follows
this one is also like to hold you

288
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,390
web also have the wrong password as an
enemy and I'm not sure what you do there

289
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,960
has been a lot more time on that but
you're interested in this appliance that

290
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:06,650
makes one Password litter favor once
because it was so it's kind of unique

291
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:17,950
virtual appliances even see this one is
actually more like Cloud Player makes a

292
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:24,240
little more popular and it is actually
good job before generating random

293
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,900
prudential's is important because all
these things the use of all passwords so

294
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:41,410
just lazy and easy 14120 just onside key
password generator on boot which is

295
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:47,650
great but I made a mistake forgot to
remove ask history and not only bad was

296
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:58,280
a typo and bashes password yes this so
they actually made increasing good

297
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:06,160
password increasing its pretty good and
use that other plans but they did they

298
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,530
accidentally typed it when they were
trying to ask you to later before and

299
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,410
then they should appliance a look at it

300
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,210
find that has spurred this is for the
admin users of another user of the

301
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:30,240
system as well but I'm in user it
actually as well so they didn't get

302
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,030
security buy a lot of other ways
generally password but they got to

303
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:42,600
delete passes through other ever since
it falls well and getting around on

304
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,090
their probably good products

305
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:53,550
so this is a quick now also keeping
standing hazards for users other than a

306
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:57,510
bit of attention that was an alternative
user actually another menu from the some

307
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:02,900
food for thought it was interesting with
keeping static passwords so like that

308
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,090
for them to log in later years for
support because you never see that

309
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:17,040
password right unless I just told you
access to all content on this briefly so

310
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,650
I suppose web application proxy other
things someone we really are but the

311
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:28,820
public but the use of you look at the
file systems that can see new manager in

312
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:42,910
the GRUB menu lists the password crack
crack crack crack crack and use that to

313
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,280
get access to do later even though the
password

314
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:53,930
call have access to the file system and
it doesn't care about her the other

315
00:33:53,930 --> 00:34:00,290
thing still but they forgot but i
wouldnt older shadow password

316
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:07,890
they'd use and the password for root was
crack might return theme here so foes

317
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:19,730
acts cracks as their password I don't
know I mean keep saying we're so so I

318
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,170
know it's never talked about Sandusky OH
MY GOD I don't wanna see more bucks

319
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:27,879
today after getting more talks

320
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:36,169
sure they'll be more somewhere else but
look at how fertile the territories for

321
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:42,309
the virtual appliances but it touches of
interest to other vendors along the way

322
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:49,029
as well and want to briefly go through
some the timeline so SolarWinds on a

323
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:58,049
boner standards for reading but somehow
products solar winds are a lot more

324
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:05,589
senior BJP he soon I know others delayed
their either generating it or you just

325
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:15,390
misplaced it I don't know they got to me
like two weeks later on June five months

326
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:20,440
later you see your cassidy fix it just
over a month I was super fast I think

327
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,819
the god help me being see him see
actually left while having more bugs

328
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:33,740
goes smoothly now got was really good
and made in in the vote they fixed it

329
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:39,119
and they noted in the visor pass
potential security has come under box

330
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,070
not potential

331
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:49,960
you pass a security vulnerability there
and another the lastest cohen's but for

332
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,870
prime infrastructure no way do they hate
the way they do advisers they released

333
00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:01,450
an advisory but if I private you have to
log into Cisco view of the stuff I like

334
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:09,530
so you wanna Google's search for bugs in
this this advisory councils go in the

335
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:19,750
guy was very open and the other ones
discussing their nation so right

336
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:28,030
conditions for vendors vendors from
VMware EMC wins talked about assume

337
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,720
everything has to be on it because of
your shipping these things I mean most

338
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,780
likely to be able to either dynamically
or statically look at least you found

339
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,270
another way to really locked down and
clean it up before I cannot believe the

340
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:45,510
amount of clients just found shipping
dies at age and dot

341
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:51,310
directories with all the mysteries
should be to be on a checklist of things

342
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:59,310
not to do far along the offensive line
great practice for this emotional and

343
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:05,690
allowed me to sit at the fire alarm on
air and turned off the sound that comes

344
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:11,180
out of his services only on localhost or
less it's like the web services talking

345
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,270
to the logos you laid there now be
interesting

346
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:26,460
can access remotely escalations in a min
before make users and passwords when you

347
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,940
ship it so easy just generate passwords
said it randomly given to the user on

348
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,400
the screen

349
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,390
another seat covers from prime glamorous
and deployment so another couple's

350
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:48,299
pretty good for security blacklist and
users are allowed access to this one

351
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:53,240
actually had Informix Informix as using
password but you could exploit it

352
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:59,210
because if you look at the remote remote
shell

353
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:07,710
they they blocked us users so then it's
gone that's good security to walk down

354
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:14,369
the aisle plants and if we do not make
the most trials be straightforward with

355
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:18,859
what you're giving people and how many
times you get one at all this is a trial

356
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:29,730
you can upgraded to full version was
like well you know there's all these

357
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:38,289
evaluations of the trial we're still
should mass development beyond a live

358
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:41,400
look like development being a problem

359
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,390
hard to keep track of this and a check
list of must not have nausea directories

360
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:53,039
fascist not sure about history know that
is the history of all can you talk to me

361
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,390
or something

362
00:38:54,390 --> 00:39:06,839
passwords you closing there's a lot of
installation analyzed and see how they

363
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:09,470
do things and system how they set
passwords how they're installing

364
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:14,660
services as a lot of support services
remote access that'd be really good look

365
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:20,150
at 44 bucks in the future and read the
documentation is a view that looked at

366
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,230
how much is really good bug knowledge
occupation

367
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:29,990
it's right there and there's other
combinations that you but no future in

368
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:44,470
this industry could be a bug you can use
it for your purpose and just a million

369
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:54,290
dollars for $500,000 much does it cost
to look at the file deleted

370
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,980
I'd like some free trial to look at the
imaging stuff but if you had like a

371
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:05,710
million dollars from software creature
these are development images and they

372
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:10,300
just like I'm going to leave the stuff
they don't even if they do you recover

373
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:19,690
that their ego and things are really
heating up I feel like I mentioned them

374
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:26,840
but they just have so many more did you
say you so they actually on the system

375
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:34,020
they left the private she's on the
virtual heights so one thing leads in

376
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,130
their root access to these to release
advisory a month or two ago about this

377
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:50,570
edition is there's a lot of stuff do
here as every talking right never

378
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:57,280
finished and they're going to come or
prevalence meddled in just a few days

379
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:05,440
cheaper data center where the sky but
getting out just these in Wonderland you

380
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,020
can see recently has been falling
anywhere and then getting a

381
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,330
probabilistic villages another like two
years ago they said they fix the bug is

382
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:23,480
to distill air so that is all I got
questions and before anything else if

383
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,390
you ask question I have some free stuff
to give you have you dirty shirts which

384
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,490
i think is right or socks

385
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:37,020
so if you asked if you ask me a good
question as a good question probably

386
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:44,110
give you something it'll be up to you
which one you get so many questions that

387
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:57,170
in measures for nothing well he was a
first sign that but if my heart or

388
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:12,490
something she emailed to you yes whether
any team where turn he turn key

389
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:22,470
somewhere where did you get this one was
only one thing with security stuff well

390
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:28,490
under my skin you access to them there's
a lot of three trials for this so for

391
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:55,150
further first question would you like
your t-shirt size advantage me well

392
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:16,040
sure thought I don't have medium and
large

393
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:50,000
yessir ok now are encrypted data so the
ones I could look at statically want to

394
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,160
because that's really the most access
usually where else you have to like rena

395
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:01,950
an annual leave an SSH and SFTP of the
files over or causes beyond just the

396
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,570
amount of the images are converted on
the side that showed how you can do it

397
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:10,940
with whom you can convert into role
first have converted from a VMDK or

398
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,400
whatever emerges are all open up in an
amateur and on the site that has all the

399
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,250
other names being drugs and stuff that's
how did mostly medical attendance you

400
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:35,300
can use the hundred t-shirt or socks
medium only have immediate answers to a

401
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:44,210
Sox so far easier

402
00:44:44,210 --> 00:45:07,599
OVF container OSB 000 yep yes yesss
container which you can use a lot of

403
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:16,180
VMware that so that's just this is gonna
tell it what image do so yeah I did a

404
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:24,940
lot of EA's which is another form at
work but it will not sir keep meaning to

405
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:54,380
throw stuff as good as an enforcer

406
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:02,680
running importance within five years and
they're actually got a question for you

407
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:17,030
just like to drive in a run but just
such a t-shirt a result I don't want me

408
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:24,829
to be sure to have suffered yes sir

409
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:50,329
am taking your advice I didn't do it I
didn't use the physical device to do it

410
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:54,489
download the firmware and its reversal
from there on the firm or sudden you've

411
00:46:54,489 --> 00:47:01,289
been one thing to look at the firmware
but I didn't use it on the actual model

412
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:06,739
number from the ship I just download the
firmware before installing a device but

413
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:11,849
I didn't really there's not a lot has
been devices there so there's a lot of

414
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:18,059
room so I OS images like a like
gigabytes does done this and that there

415
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,009
is like we gotta conserve space so we
really put in the bare minimum so make

416
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:34,109
secured it'll be easier for us to get
smaller so they can better manage their

417
00:47:34,109 --> 00:47:38,920
words like can't fit all these passwords
on here

418
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:47,300
t-shirt under hard

419
00:47:47,300 --> 00:48:04,090
more stuff out of the questions I don't
have much money a lot of money

420
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:38,680
million touching that operators are you
talk to him so unless they were matches

421
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:45,890
kind of all I don't think I'll be very
unless you're physically doing like

422
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,880
maybe a fantastically and you're there
and then you had access the system after

423
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,000
someone in that would be a good question

424
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:12,050
yea yea or follow us on the system's
that would definitely hopefully now

425
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:24,220
though even the good times and memories
from those questions out there

426
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:38,770
ok realm I believe what was the first
Cisco on the pages so they rebranded as

427
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:44,390
they only under for single are something
and that was really confusing 2011

428
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:53,599
completion to Mike vs single wires think
we could see some overlap there where

429
00:49:53,599 --> 00:50:00,720
you know the the actual vendor of the OS
the vendor providing it to the OEM

430
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,380
management stuff or vice versa and not
being able to cover the security on both

431
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:10,230
ends and maybe they will have access to
some of the stuff on there so they can

432
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:16,820
verify love the security anyways so have
a look at that but yeah that's a that's

433
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:24,410
a good thing to look at the future to
answer questions from our stuff now you

434
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:29,570
