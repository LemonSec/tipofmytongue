5
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,850

11
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:32,789
to he said calm then I went to where
we're standing ovation to ground zero

12
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:39,700
for sex D rice book on new kits that
features heavy security then I went to

13
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,590
bsides Austin

14
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:49,270
scared eng sub security you generation
then I was unveiled from server box as a

15
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:56,140
real next-generation seven scary in our
say I can really say however in a box

16
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:03,770
packing box conference and I just wanna
say I really appreciate it thanks to

17
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,039
Dave Canadian team for giving me my very

18
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:17,010
conference show thanks thanks very calm
I want to see all of Derby Conn could

19
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,190
you make us feel loved inception and her
family so here's some other fun facts

20
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,900
about me when I was changing America's
most beautiful baby

21
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:39,090
wow sounds old else america america has
shown no conflict in 2014 15 I was deep

22
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:46,000
disco contest one how did you start on
contest the company kid who who

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:00,780
recognizes that recognizes the candy
making and truly I must go before I

24
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,209
sleep these are video biography species
have any time I was to you

25
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:16,150
USA Gymnastics state champion for the
rings out my main topic

26
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,459
office what I get out of it

27
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,379
RBC building blocks that kids use a
separate nation to make words ok

28
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,439
kathleen was gonna say you're welcome

29
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:43,680
320 okay and tony has talked

30
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:56,629
that's our basic building blocks that
could use at their foundation and are

31
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:03,480
speaking art stands for address
resolution protocol ARP happy IP address

32
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,639
to the MAC address so that he can accept
and communication that the correct

33
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,239
device on the network

34
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,060
spoofing is one he has cables
information to change the IP address to

35
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,340
point he is back at it so that he can
intercept other question our

36
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,660
communications from different devices on
the network a simple way to understand

37
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,820
this is by using simple mailboxes and
all the mailboxes in my neighborhood

38
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:46,400
located in common area inside my mailbox
mailbox is our families with our house

39
00:04:46,400 --> 00:05:01,460
is 1337 backgrounds bobby is 1057 so I
get home I will need to find a way to be

40
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,169
home at her I wanted to find a way to
change parties home address 2.2 my name

41
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,229
change his name to point to my address
which is basically what are keeping

42
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:19,310
those about the overflow attack which
the hacker inputs more than what the

43
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,080
memory buffer can hold if the code is
not check how long the input is popping

44
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,729
it to the memory but there are trying a
case of instruction pointer will get

45
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:35,490
over it and the hacker can put it this
way to understand this is by example of

46
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,389
a birthday party invite you to my
friends to a birthday party gave them my

47
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:45,070
house actors at that guy and put the
sign over my house actress that the

48
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,520
party has moved to his house so on my
credit going to his house to get rock

49
00:05:50,520 --> 00:06:03,979
free clinics explain cross-site request
forgery is the usual log into his bank

50
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:09,750
account he gets a second shift he gets
an email with a link on it clicks on the

51
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,819
link and you realize that money from his
bank account gets talked so how did this

52
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:20,069
happen to have emotions he crafted
length transfer money from his bank out

53
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:28,210
by using the previously established
damage is saying you're invited to a

54
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,330
birthday party candy shop you possess
invitation card to get into the shop

55
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:43,930
securing entry pass and he wants candy
too but he does not have an entry or

56
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:50,909
invitation so he tricks the other kid
with E and she got to go in and get

57
00:06:50,909 --> 00:07:11,229
candy for him it's time to party now
this entry pathways are in use before I

58
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:19,889
dunno service which the hacker system
software system data unavailable someone

59
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:20,830
who needs it

60
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:31,240
hacker c.k by closing a pore over the
website too many times or even do a

61
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,029
document a location that extra

62
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:44,289
site

63
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:58,159
your understanding how serious his
family and then had the service

64
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:09,180
picture for exploit frameworks and
exploit exploit a simple way to

65
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,520
understand this is how I go to my shower
and Ocampo class I can boast 09 shucks

66
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,339
and sword and a comfy back

67
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:34,839
exploit remarks is kinda like this it's
basically a 20 bag basically at all that

68
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:45,370
in it to win it to test the system is
exploitable are not just as any of these

69
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:51,980
tools can be used for purposes but just
as any of these weapons just as any of

70
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,720
the weapons can be used for good or bad
purposes he said were close to be a good

71
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,490
purposes i cant testing purposes

72
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:07,810
hacking here are some of the well-known
actually about exploitation former army

73
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,040
chief Metasploit Framework

74
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:17,030
MSF so Sean Garrett ok or is he talking
about

75
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:37,810
the OIC ok explain Armitage and tell her
body

76
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:46,120
charity testing the test the system is
exploitable not injecting random input a

77
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,880
real-world example this is our drug
testing if you're looking to something

78
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,760
you don't know what the doctor will
inject different types of our genes we

79
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:01,770
enter your personal and she tried to
tell you she is fine she attacks TV

80
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:08,130
attack inside computer graphics card
that is responsible for processing and

81
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:18,380
displaying images text and videos and
GPU the GPS dedicated memory as well I

82
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:29,530
said ship the GPU graphics processing
unit GPU is put to keep you attack GPO

83
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:37,350
tax on families for power cracking
attacks too young to keep you to do it

84
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:46,450
at the meeting process then he CPU is
much faster a pirate tool is better than

85
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:58,620
hash cat so chances by the all that's
wrong but it could take five he's super

86
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:10,130
fast super managed to keep you feel
which employers and employees into an

87
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:22,910
algorithm which converting output
numbers and letters to have to accept

88
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,670
that you can never get rich off value
back a good example of this is

89
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:38,050
your strawberries are like the input the
album and you can never get the original

90
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:46,470
robberies back this will be his friend
section and sections track which Dr

91
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,450
backend database except when the user
supplies without any allegation

92
00:11:50,450 --> 00:12:01,660
introduced its handle right in our
concentration 39 concentration over what

93
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:08,220
it can handle that have you ever
wondered what the meaning is highly

94
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,720
concentrated protein so when a snake
bite you inject it into your body and

95
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,700
your body candy body as commander
shutdown which can include some serious

96
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:30,160
damage so jane is for Java applet Java
applet attack attack which he hacker v2

97
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:40,370
malicious Java applet in the sixties and
buy some social engineers have a full

98
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:51,820
tank of missions and can completely
exploit the system so simple and uses of

99
00:12:51,820 --> 00:13:01,570
a real kid get in the video game arcade
get that kind of like the shop up you

100
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:14,840
will get the idea is to keep and which
to keystrokes and and dogged

101
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:26,270
need a simple changes its talk a lot
when their school lockers

102
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,650
kidding want to find out about what
somebody was talking about but hindsight

103
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:41,400
a locker a logic bomb a piece of code
that runs want to spend time are

104
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:48,140
conditions met simple went on Shannon
example of a cook over a cuckoo bird

105
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:54,580
eggs and other birds nest because it is
truly heroic stopped so I think about

106
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:02,530
hatch's it is all of the other edge off
the net and takes over the next time and

107
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,300
go home and they don't impersonates
gateway around her and tells him that

108
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,870
he's the client and at the same time at
his to get where outer called

109
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:20,410
communication goes to the house in this
picture you see that they're trying to

110
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,920
get the ball game and the monkey is like
the hacker

111
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:37,120
mediation appt international thing but
not tonight at all I'll say is just got

112
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,190
half in the system

113
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:44,070
recorded all the interactions and
transactions between all the

114
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:51,530
interactions transactions CNN com city
dogs have you actually moving

115
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,560
Incredibles what you guys for watching
kids

116
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:12,270
he's called to the principal's office of
putting tacked onto your chair at Fresh

117
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:20,380
dash tries to repeat itself but the
highlight video camera and catches dash

118
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:28,610
to his machine now application cannot
deny 2004 obfuscation applications

119
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,820
defensive technique in which her she
sleep schedule according to data so that

120
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:40,460
will be hard for each year and find out
what coordinated else so what happens a

121
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:46,990
venir have found out that my family and
data they can invade into our objection

122
00:15:46,990 --> 00:16:02,700
is making me and being it's not easy to
begin should be as EDS then when it

123
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,650
served as trips with eggs it'll be
easier for someone to pick out but that

124
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,670
they can chopped up into pieces

125
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:17,560
stated then it'll be hard for somebody
to pick out and almost like undetected

126
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:25,089
he is fishing fishing is to lure and
bait feeling personal information about

127
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:36,290
themselves is a part of so far have you
all to you

128
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:49,250
in the movie there's an angler fish to
be more efficient capture that is for

129
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,350
Corey's

130
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:58,670
otherwise known as target not talking
about a happy to find numerous countries

131
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,350
chase card companies country's children
know these countries but even her

132
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:10,819
children educated et cetera brain
coercion

133
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:27,179
dangers how many of yall know what what
what in the movie expert are sure who

134
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:35,760
shot his any target just as a hacker
will go after his or her targets are

135
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,419
from you are ok so what is a real
computer program a program that allows

136
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:52,120
hope control system that is installed on
my meeting asking operating system

137
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,840
forgot about purposes mostly used for
bad purposes like spying on me for good

138
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:06,940
purposes like running tech support and
picture I give the example of the

139
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:14,549
enormous in da shower used operating
system with other various programs like

140
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:25,340
these make a fish and soft wire is
basically software that by some people

141
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:37,909
information i buy where he's at or
otherwise known as I am with protection

142
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,860
network traffic

143
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:47,090
lets you browse by keeping our
application for for kids that it allowed

144
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:55,720
without provocation Shelby Harper
somebody truck that he that man haven't

145
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:06,850
stopped checking again so location back
in the senate hardly shoe store you talk

146
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:17,520
to you about Aug 10 attack I cannot
guarantee that you'll get it get it

147
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:26,610
AUD people attack but do keep packets
into the network so that the network is

148
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:41,320
congested example of this is where I in
a traffic jam packed to continue to keep

149
00:19:41,320 --> 00:20:03,100
our like these from iris a barrage of
our our that Hutchison show to homes and

150
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:12,490
it's hard for example of this is from a
living parasite has to cut health care

151
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:25,400
system holds much wow I want our that
tragedy and network network systems and

152
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,090
that work is harmful IT skills
information it can and shop owners and

153
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:42,640
it can affect 3 information security
integrity and availability so I don't

154
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,420
have very much

155
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:55,020
samples for that extra cross-site
scripting XSS shipping is when you

156
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:03,470
inject code into a input field as a
script example of this is steal a nice

157
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,740
turn pro

158
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:11,950
body interest we shall be it causes some
serious harm to you can lead to

159
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:18,500
infection disease or death can you
assure so what is it quotes be harmful

160
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,290
body with some company maker

161
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:36,560
out of it comes a hot girl the
application is the one bodies script or

162
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:46,150
anger is like why is for you people are
the weakest link

163
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,420
they have people than it is to have
system because they implicitly trust

164
00:21:51,420 --> 00:22:03,030
others without any foundation and she
seemed like nobody really thank you

165
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:09,570
bode bode is otherwise known as OJ or
negative day and in fact are usually

166
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:17,170
unaware of what the hackers hackers had
the advantage usually is launched today

167
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:28,910
that the soccer comes out my dad and mom
taught me 20 here you know has no value

168
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,800
but when it rains do something but when
I was raised to the power of something

169
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,160
called a 10 inch care software

170
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:52,060
oh so now my gosh Asian sure we'll ever
watch my video that I get a Java applet

171
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,720

and well when do you have to click on a

172
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:04,890
link for them they don't get these are
the things they don't get back on track

173
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:23,049
to let them with cash and without
permission

174
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:39,379
so it'd be cool if we get redirected
user to a pic website that we control

175
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:42,840
and they just got that even doing
anything or even knowing that they get

176
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:53,570
so am I gonna be doing so i right

forever until they close the browser

199
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:48,310
