1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
hello unfortunately this is the video
which we actually realize that there was

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,080
a problem to audio system in the
three-way track with the night before

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,290
but then someone out ok to carry out of
something if you want to see the Billy

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:42:33,570
Talent is talk it starts about the 46th
minute

5
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:38,800
report that state law law can be
different and the 11th federal districts

6
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,430
until the USS Supreme Court decides on
something that's not the law everywhere

7
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:49,190
so you know that case that I read was
from New York and you know so that made

8
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,760
would mean here or in a different
district that this federal court may

9
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,970
deem it a little different and until
there's a unifying case that the United

10
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,770
States Supreme Court and that's
primarily of you wonder what cases dus

11
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:05,750
Supreme Court accepts that they really
accept cases that where there are

12
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:10,260
conflicts between two districts so that
they can unify the law across the whole

13
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:22,700
country is your account how it works go
ahead then they were charged with a

14
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,120
spoliation of evidence is what thats
called and talked about that here in a

15
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:32,080
minute now last three parts of the CFAA

16
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,140
access knowingly accessing a protected
computer with the intent to defraud

17
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,530
thereby obtaining anything of value

18
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:44,240
knowingly cause and transmission of a
program information or command that

19
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,680
causes damage or intentionally access a
computer without authorization

20
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,460
you know we all do that knowingly and
with intent to defraud trafficking a

21
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,190
password or similar information through
which your computer may be accessed

22
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,860
without authorization

23
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:10,770
here's a few cases about the CFAA United
States first kramer this is a guy who

24
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:14,390
and what's important about this case is
asked the guy was a pedophile that talk

25
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:19,610
to us young lady and meaning to have sex
but they charging the CFAA because he

26
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,830
said he did with his cell phone and the
court ruled that the cell phone was a

27
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:31,070
computer so it is roles of fun too we
all know better Bradley Manning case

28
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:37,120
that was part of the WikiLeaks the big
big league Casey went to jail

29
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,770
this is an interesting new case is just
from this year

30
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:46,140
Craigslist first three taps three taps
was a company that did

31
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,559
a scraping of Craigslist real estate
listings for their they've developed a

32
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:58,660
cool new interface to do Craigslist real
estate listings and Craigslist said that

33
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:04,039
some cease and desist order and how
people are well I kept doing anyway so

34
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:09,740
this is what the judge said he said the
average person does not years anonymous

35
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:15,519
proxies or to bypass a nap P block in
order to enforce banning communications

36
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,510
via personally directed cease and desist
order so the judge said three taps you

37
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,769
really can't do that you can't hang
around their IP block and keep doing it

38
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:33,269
so they charged him at the CFA this
first case here is just want it just

39
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:40,859
shows how incredibly stupid people are
sometimes the school district and Marin

40
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:44,099
County Pennsylvania decided would be
really cool to give all their students

41
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,670
laptops but they didn't want anybody 12
student to use them so they thought it

42
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:52,079
would be the way to prevent that will be
deceptive webcam to take a picture in a

43
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,589
while so they can see who was doing so
at the end of the day they ended up with

44
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:05,839
66,000 webshots and screenshots of
pictures of girls in their bedrooms that

45
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,980
didn't go well for them and here's a
couple of other things that are just

46
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,529
just have no you know they charge the
guy who stole a bunch of data from his

47
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:18,920
clients and use it to start his own
business and injured another guy who

48
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,529
deleted a bunch of stuff when you left
to cover up his bad behavior

49
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:31,200
there's a statute of limitations real
quick you know that i did some more as a

50
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,720
long time ago when I was young and
stupid don't know any better one how

51
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:41,069
long do I have to sweat the Forsaken
come get me the answer is typically two

52
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:45,799
years in the absence of a specific
statute to defaults five years there a

53
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:51,190
couple of exceptions acts of terrorism
eight years or the worst one of course

54
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,509
if it's if you hurt somebody or there
was an imminent risk of party somebody

55
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:57,710
that it's forever

56
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:02,660
if the police are coming after you can
you record to police anybody know the

57
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:12,790
answer is yes you can with only but here
are the caveat it's the carry outs in 38

58
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:19,070
states it's plain laws very clear and
twelve states and there's the list you

59
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:22,380
have to request now keep in mind that
there's a there's a distinct difference

60
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:28,020
in the law between record a video
recording and audio recording in 12

61
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:33,880
states you have to have both parties
permission to do an audio recording and

62
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,680
but in all of all but two states have
have an exemption and the exemption is

63
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,700
expectation of privacy if you're in a
public place like here or on the street

64
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:49,619
you have no expectation of privacy for
anything you do or say so you could be

65
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,430
recorded

66
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,950
except for these two states
Massachusetts in our own ways they are

67
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,970
the only states that have not upheld
that expectation of privacy so much your

68
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:03,820
messages are always been recorded now

69
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:08,330
number to about this is do not secretly
recorded police opened fire according to

70
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,010
police is different and secretly
recording the place and there's been

71
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:16,200
some cases about that the wrong number
three still use your head and don't

72
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,900
respond to the cops they will lot of you
they will intimidate you and I will try

73
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,450
to bully you into stopped doing it just
be nice don't report don't respond

74
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:34,849
because they do you do now what do you
do if you run into this guy first thing

75
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:42,099
you do is shut up do not be like Ron
White who said I knew I had the right to

76
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:45,839
remain silent but I did not have the
ability

77
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:52,809
don't do their role one and a half

78
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:57,950
dole do anything don't smash you two
factor authentication key there's a

79
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:03,670
number to call a lawyer number three

80
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:08,519
this seems self explanatory but I see it
happen all the time do exactly what the

81
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,089
lawyer says that was the first I've been
in this situation the first thing I was

82
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:19,690
gonna tell you shut up

83
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:24,500
as the first thing is gonna say
everytime seen it happen any other

84
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:44,920
questions sorry if I ran at kennesaw
boxy but that's just me

85
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,710
that's your depend on your employment
contract

86
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:54,010
the question was is your company
obligated to carriers and emissions

87
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:59,940
insurance on you and you know i mean
they should it would be kinda crappy if

88
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,300
they didn't in my opinion but you know
if your employment contract says that we

89
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:11,280
don't have to you know now here's the
other thing if you are working on an

90
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,280
engagement and you break something or
you call something to happen I mean you

91
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,530
you were on an engagement that was
contracted you aren't the one that was

92
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:23,620
contracted your company was contracted
you're acting as an agent of your

93
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:29,980
company I can tell you from my law firms
perspective we wouldn't see you we would

94
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:34,070
see your company because you are an
agent on behalf of your company that's

95
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:38,960
an important distinction now if you're
now if your company said is the twister

96
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,430
that if your company said that you were
working outside the scope of your

97
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:52,360
employment then you're on the hook now
down and it has never been in the

98
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:56,920
information security industry like like
the case of person comes to my mind is

99
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,829
it was traveling salesman who was
driving on the interstate

100
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:06,229
and he was talking on a cellphone Iran
over this lady and killed ok now he said

101
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:10,829
that he was doing that on sales call is
under the scope of his employment we

102
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:16,579
could see him had to sue his employer
his employer however looked at his sales

103
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:20,109
route and said you weren't on the way to
a call you're on the way somewhere else

104
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:24,569
so you're without the sad to school with
your employment you're on your own

105
00:51:24,569 --> 00:51:33,489
you're far so not in the information
security industry but same concept

106
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:48,970
forward yes

107
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:58,040
hopefully before this before this gets
too far along the best part of opted to

108
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,369
slide in here cuz I want people to be
talking about that you know that leads

109
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:05,540
to get out there the eff needs to get
involved the big encryption cups like he

110
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,820
said Cisco stuff needs to get involved
in initiation bracket about this I was

111
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:14,320
shocked when I read that because I
hadn't heard about and it was months ago

112
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:19,650
so anyhow thanks for coming to see bill
