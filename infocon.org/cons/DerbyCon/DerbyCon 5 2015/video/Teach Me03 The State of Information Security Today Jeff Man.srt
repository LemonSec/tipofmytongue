1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,759
my name's Jeff man I'm a strategist with
tenable network security at like to

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,690
thank Derby Conn for letting me speak
here this afternoon to you at the

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,719
beginning of conversation give you my
contact information if you still wanted

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,970
by the end of the conversation I'll try
to remember to repeat it that's what I

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,189
used to look like my younger days

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:27,390
minute try to move quickly through this
especially the early part my background

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,830
is I'm not here to talk about myself but
the point of this talk is really I've

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,280
been in the business for a long time and
I've been pondering the last year or so

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,360
you with all the bridges that are
happening at all the vulnerabilities

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,590
that are being discovered and some
trusted tools know how far have we

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,329
really try so little bit about my
background in to where we stand today

12
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,070
from a security perspective why was
failing to continue to fail I will offer

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:08,420
a solution and it's my opinion based on
a lot of experience and hopefully that's

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,460
not here to tell you the right thing I'm
here to generate ideas get you thinking

15
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,939
feel free to disagree with me but
hopefully it's a discussion started to

16
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:25,580
allow time at the Q&A that interrupts
during the talks have been in the

17
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:35,829
business information security for about
32 33 years I did start the bulk of my

18
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:40,970
career working for the defense
department at a certain three-letter

19
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:47,630
agency had been doing this in Internet
information

20
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,460
network data security thing pretty much
since the beginning twenty years twenty

21
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,850
some years ago at some point I ended up
in PCI purgatory ended up being there

22
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,890
for about 10 years so my DOD background
is primarily with the National Security

23
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,849
Agency I started out as a panelist one
of the first things I did is equipped

24
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:17,599
analyst at an assay was we had customers
back then the customer was primarily the

25
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,150
army the military and these guys that
were using secret codes to talk to

26
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,440
people that we may be enlisted that
might be citizens of other countries

27
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,500
giving us information they communicated
with something called a one-time which

28
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,660
is the only hundred-percent secure
system unbreakable if you use the

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,880
correct but they are these the guys we
were dealing with the customers they had

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,840
these PCs on their desk and they were
asking is there some way to do this

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,730
encryption decryption thing using his
computer and we decided the other is so

32
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,970
to my knowledge I was responsible for
her safe for the first offered base

33
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,739
cryptographic system that has ever
produced

34
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,609
they semi automated one time those
things in the middle of those are called

35
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:15,819
floppy disk even though they were
actually hard plastic and that's where

36
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:22,489
the key was added another customer that
was special forces they used a different

37
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,750
type of one-time pad with a different
type of algorithm called a visionary

38
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,069
square just a simple substitution table
as you see there is the alphabet 26

39
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,790
different slides so it's like a Caesar
cipher

40
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:41,380
26 offsets they memorize this thing that
this this this this type of algorithm

41
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,580
actually translates to something like
two hundred and twenty-three unique

42
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,570
stream letter characters and they would
memorize it I was working with them in

43
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,050
and I didn't have the opportunity to
memorize it but I just been through some

44
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,750
crypto training classes and learn about
site for reals so I came up with a site

45
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,790
four wheel that was actually division
here we all they liked it so much when I

46
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,850
would go out to the field they kept
stealing them from me so we ended up

47
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,030
just making thousands of them

48
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,940
shipping route to Special Forces so
whenever I run into a special forces

49
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,989
person I asked them they they told me
that they called it the wizzy real and I

50
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:21,720
always ask them if they have ever heard
of this is the guy that invented I

51
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,530
didn't talk about a month ago a guy came
up to me afterwards I said I didn't do

52
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,260
you invented the winds we like got one
of those was kinda cool I told him I'd

53
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:42,380
autograph see him again in my time and I
say I had this thing happened where and

54
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,450
I read this article just couple years
ago

55
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,320
2013 where they're talking about this
crypt of statues anybody ever heard of

56
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,550
that trip to the statue in the courtyard
CIA headquarters was reading this

57
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,730
article

58
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,430
group of Venice a in terms they were
there and they took the code back and

59
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,060
basically wired had an article

60
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,140
couple months before this saying that
there was some guy at CIA that had

61
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:12,620
broken the things done it at lunch time
over the years kind of pet project but

62
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,530
this article revealed that people from
an assay had broken it years before this

63
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,970
guy and I can say I was one of those
interns have been mentioned in Wired

64
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,330
magazine

65
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,360
towards the latter part of my career
Tennessee moved over to what at the time

66
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,990
was called the InfoSec site I think they
called information assurance these days

67
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:41,229
and got in kind of hit the ground floor
learning how to do what's come to be

68
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:45,520
known as red teaming penetration testing
that type of things as part of the

69
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,710
organization that kind of first started
developing methodologies and started

70
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:56,219
starting to do that type of work in a
little bit of forensics little bit of

71
00:05:56,219 --> 00:06:00,500
threat detection and really what
happened was I was getting I got

72
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,030
together in an office with a bunch of
guys and at the time and it happened

73
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:11,940
twenty years ago why this talking about
that we went down to visit this place

74
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,960
called the Air Force Information Warfare
Center at the time twenty years ago they

75
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:25,310
were they were they were the primary
agency within the DoD that was doing all

76
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,300
this pen testing thing they set up the
first serve they were doing the

77
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,960
monitoring the air force was responsible
for all the networks within the DoD so

78
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,000
we went down there to learn and i
actually gave this talk for the first

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,210
time back in February of this year in
San Antonio that's that's what got me

80
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:49,319
thinking hey it's been 20 years since
the beginning I should do it based on my

81
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:56,400
twenty-year history in a little bit of
forensic work on my customers which was

82
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,949
the Department of Justice has anybody
ever heard of this website defacement

83
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,389
remember back in the early days

84
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:11,819
hackers deface websites and that was it
like you leaving any string I can get

85
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,969
here look at me I was part of a team
that went down there to try to help them

86
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,169
figure out

87
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,249
you know what had gone wrong who had
done and of course the first thing they

88
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:26,199
did was unplug everything and rebuild
the servers so in a whole lot to do

89
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,389
actually I left Tennessee went out into
the greener pastures and commercial

90
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:38,680
sector and wanted to do this testing
thing commercially and try to help

91
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,969
customers solve all their problems and
be secure and I was naive in the

92
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:48,800
beginning it was mentioned this morning
during one of the key knows what happens

93
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,159
when we fix all the problems when we go
on until all the holes in and we're done

94
00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:01,639
what are we gonna do maybe that's why I
ended up in PCI I was it was accuracy

95
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:07,129
for ten years and i actually had a very
unique experience I was involved with

96
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:12,569
PCI practice that for whatever reason we
were the practice was called in for a

97
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:17,219
lot of the companies in the mid to
thousands of suffering breaches mostly

98
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:22,999
the Gonzales ring to Jackson's in there
for them for six years

99
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:29,870
Heartland they were payment processor
that popped I've had a lot of experience

100
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,349
going into a lot of different companies
if you look up here there's there's

101
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:40,649
banks there's retail obviously there's
gas stations 1 800 flowers e-commerce

102
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,940
grocery stores

103
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:49,060
lot of different companies lot of
different corporate environments lot of

104
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,399
different corporate culture lot of
different expertise levels but really a

105
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,390
lot of companies security is not really
a core competency so coming in

106
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:04,850
presenting them with PCI was really an
opportunity to teach security to talk

107
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:11,540
these days I teach about security so
that's my background in the context of

108
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,040
been in this from the beginning and then
so so where do we stand today twenty

109
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,080
years later

110
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,800
obviously there's been lots of breaches
in the news

111
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,970
vulnerabilities that have been around
and some of the tools of the use of

112
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,950
being discovered and and they've
apparently been there since the very

113
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,470
beginning

114
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,050
social engineering phishing attacks
shared passwords are still weak

115
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:44,760
passwords there's still default settings
that was a problem twenty years ago and

116
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,480
it's still a problem today which gets me
an old-timer thinking gee I really

117
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,890
really really accomplishing anything as
it is a security industry is a hacker

118
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,840
industry are really making a difference

119
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,870
what has changed technology certainly
change certainly gotten a lot faster

120
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,670
you've heard talks and probably will
continue to your talks about the the the

121
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,490
concept of a network perimeter and what
is that these days

122
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,810
mobile devices bring bring your own
device BYOD there's cloud virtual

123
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,410
there's just so much more going on from
a technology perspective that some of

124
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:30,050
these fundamental things haven't really
changed all what are the threats today

125
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:39,090
wire people doing what they're doing the
back after you know there's all sorts of

126
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:44,650
reasons why they do it inside outside
threats you really when it comes down to

127
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,110
it in the early days it was more hey can
I get there nowadays they figured out

128
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:56,300
how to monetize make a little money lots
of some political reasons sometimes and

129
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:05,750
get into the whole nations state to be a
believer that it's it's out there is a

130
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:12,870
possible motive was just so why are we
feeling going wrong

131
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:21,040
business literally hundreds of different
companies the biggest problems is

132
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,230
there's just too many solutions out
there it's it's a very common saying

133
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,279
within the industry especially from a
vendor perspective that there's no such

134
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,060
thing as a silver bullet solution to his
that's what everybody wants they just

135
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,910
want to buy something set it and forget
about it a lot of companies but there

136
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,210
but there isn't really a single silver
bullet solution there's really a whole

137
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,770
magazine for the silver bullets that
companies have to buy and this is kind

138
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,520
of from a PCI perspective these are the
types of things that you kinda sorta

139
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,380
need to have approached PCI compliance
so there's really too many silver

140
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,970
bullets out there and there's a problem
in that respect to companies having an

141
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,970
over reliance on technology because they
have to have some discussions morning

142
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,000
during the keynote panel about
automation and augmentation what the

143
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,390
role is and they were speaking the
context of pen testing only extends to

144
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:22,480
any security technology that's out there
you to what degree do you rely on the

145
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,600
automation necessary but the
over-reliance the false sense of

146
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:37,640
security I think you problems the other
big problem is this may sound a little

147
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,610
bit old school that the lack of written
policies and procedures

148
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:49,340
i think is a huge problem and if you if
you're looking for a definition of

149
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:58,050
an information security policy it starts
with a goal was also believed it was

150
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,770
Katie that said you know what are you
doing what's your goal

151
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,400
what are you trying to protect lot of
companies don't understand that they

152
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,210
know that they have to buy a fire or do
they need an ideal solution they know

153
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,750
they need a sim solution they know they
need to this they needed that they've

154
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,380
got into the compliance thing and they
run around and do all that stuff but

155
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,660
fundamentally if you sit down and ask
them a lot of people in the company

156
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,510
don't really know what it is that
they're trying to protect all we have to

157
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,430
do a PC I think it's got something to do
with credit cards

158
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,600
ok to do with credit card information
there's other personal information

159
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,380
associated with that also needs to be
addressed so you know what it is maybe

160
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,900
you know where it is we have no idea
where it is so on and so forth

161
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,660
lot of slot there's a lot of silos
within companies within I T departments

162
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:55,250
within business units people actually
work in some sort of consulting role you

163
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,810
people out there maybe this has been
your experience to be very often when I

164
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,990
was going into a company's aqsa and I
would have to talk to each and every one

165
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,180
of the sailors each and every one of the
groups it was rare that anybody that I

166
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,460
talked to understand the big picture of
what the company was about you know they

167
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,900
knew there were grocery stores groceries
but in terms of the network architecture

168
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:23,410
that apology where sensitive data store
where it was flowing most people didn't

169
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,840
know in fact was very common if you
talked to the network guys well we set

170
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,430
up the network we set up the firewalls
and that's about it if you talk to the

171
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,270
server people will have the UNIX guys
and then there's the windows guys you

172
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,899
know

173
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,420
well what's running on your server the
church ministry I mean even talking to

174
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,930
TVA's database administrators tell me
about the scheme of the databases show

175
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,230
me the fields were thus the data stored
and they could do that and you know what

176
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,920
this database is about you know what
kind of information is on here a lot of

177
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,220
them didn't know they like now it just
needs to be a certain size and accept a

178
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:07,040
certain type of data so very common for
me was I would walk away after spending

179
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,079
a week or two of these companies having
a better picture of the operation of the

180
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,939
company than any one person that I
talked to a less you found someone guy

181
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:22,720
in the company that's been there forever
started in the mailroom knew how to do

182
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,619
COBOL program so we ended up working on
the mainstream and kinda knew how

183
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:36,179
everything worked but those guys are
becoming more rare to find so companies

184
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,809
don't understand sort of the sort of the
process and starting from some

185
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:50,309
foundational point of having a policy
having a plan they focus more on what's

186
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:54,179
the what's the minimum amount of
investment we need to make whether it's

187
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,819
buying something whether it's paying for
assessment or consulting services so on

188
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,029
and so forth

189
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,420
there's a lot of reasons why

190
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:11,790
companies don't approach security from a
store but programmatic prospective some

191
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,000
of these are here this is some of these
guys are just rambling thoughts and

192
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,650
they're they're mostly to prompt me and
I will make slides available sure if for

193
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:28,450
any reason you want these later what I
tried to teach my customers over the

194
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,740
years is to help them understand that
security first and foremost is not a

195
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:39,890
desired state that you get to a life
cycle it's an ongoing process and you

196
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:45,310
exist as a company somewhere in a
process of doing security if you're

197
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:50,980
approaching it all you can argue maybe
some of the stages but in general

198
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:57,030
especially in the early days it all
started with assessment where r you doin

199
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,930
gap analysis what are you working with
what's out there what's missing

200
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:07,750
especially from a PCI perspective
usually the first pass is so many holes

201
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:14,320
in the months of how do we get to where
we need to be and that next step

202
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,390
involves having a strategy developing a
policy policy at the highest level is

203
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,760
we're gonna be secure or insecure the
state are working to secure corporate

204
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,010
reputation

205
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,330
we're going to see a website whatever
very high level and it's pretty sure

206
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:32,340
when you get into the standards how do
we do this and then the procedures of

207
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,430
the actual step-by-step guide into that
closely as the architecture building out

208
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,610
the solutions and then of course you
have to live with them implement them

209
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,790
you run with it and then that's when
this work comes first circle and you now

210
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,610
becomes more of an audit because you're
hopefully measuring against your own

211
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:55,420
policy your own strategy is how well are
we doing what we set out to do is are we

212
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:02,130
missing things we need to fine tune it
so lifecycle continuous

213
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:09,210
obviously systematically you need to
have a policy to kind of make it all

214
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:17,610
work anybody know the name Marcus Ranum
saw him talk some years ago and he was

215
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,460
talking about firewalls and the need for
firewalls and he made a statement that

216
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:27,240
stuck with me he said if you don't have
a policy you don't really have a

217
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,190
firewall meaning if you don't have
something written down as to what the

218
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,280
firewall is going to do not allow how do
you measure with your firewalls working

219
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,220
that kind of stuck with me and I said
what kind of works for every aspect of

220
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:48,480
every part of this whole thing that
really policy is the key

221
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:57,960
what is a policy addresses already it's
it's the game plan it's the way that you

222
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,540
justify budgets and it's something
that's written down the plan to measure

223
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:11,590
yourself against its really key to
enabling business and business and

224
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,600
business operations has to be a part of
the strategy is well this is what you

225
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,780
usually see from companies in terms of
their attitude about policy because a

226
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,460
lot of PCR requires that you have to
have two things written there and

227
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,370
they're supposed to be reviewed annually
it was very common to go win to do the

228
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,930
on-site assessment get the stack of
policies and lo and behold the annual

229
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,190
review it happened the week before we
showed up on site and fifty documents

230
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,910
have been reviewed in one day they had
to date we knew there was a game being

231
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:54,490
in the configuration rules for a
firewall its Marcus reference

232
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:00,540
a lot of times the policy companies
might be like this

233
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:08,910
seen this policy is collecting dust on
the shelf but it's not meant to be there

234
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:14,470
and and and what i'm saying is policy is
necessary and there's a way to use it

235
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:22,890
use it productively you can use policies
of dozens case was very common

236
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,350
especially in the early days

237
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,230
PCI to go win and I could make friends
with the idea in the security people

238
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:37,470
that didn't like seeing you there anyway
to alter the look you know what your

239
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,320
problems are you know what you need

240
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,460
work with me as I slap PCI on it guess
what you'll get your budget is your

241
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,100
management doesn't understand your sea
level people don't understand PCI

242
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,470
insecurity that they know they have to
get by this PCI thing so tell them you

243
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:58,460
need it slapped PCI on it trust me the
budget and lo and behold it was and I

244
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,360
made France and then we could have a
better discussion about what was really

245
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:12,670
going obviously having the policy is a
way to meet PCI another compliance

246
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:19,350
regulations and compliance you know who
is sort of address this morning again if

247
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,640
peace I didn't exist a lot of this
industry really wouldn't be doing a

248
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,800
strong as it is and that's a that's the
reality

249
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,040
providing a framework a way to measure a
way of having understanding way of

250
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,890
getting everybody in the company
involved these are all things that help

251
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:45,610
justify why you need to do policy other
than the right thing to do and I keep

252
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,540
underscoring this our focus is an
industry is always on the technology

253
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:55,840
technology without context is just
technology there's more to it than that

254
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:06,960
obviously policy is not popular not
popular to write things down it's much

255
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,210
easier to just make things work and its
nothing's going wrong everything's are

256
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:26,380
ok this is not new but this is this is
neglected the positive spin of why you

257
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,870
need to have a policy and strategy is to
take into account the whole business

258
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:42,030
operations take into account the
corporate culture I had never seen it

259
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:49,370
work effectively where the wasn't
management buy-in too often i've seen

260
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,510
there's a lot of rules in place that the
rules are kind of ignored by the admins

261
00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:02,350
by the sea level people running some
simple you're the CEO secretary does his

262
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:10,550
email and has a password on down the
line the sacred cow being the

263
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,840
administrator gets to do what he wants
to do because he's got the keys of the

264
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,570
kingdom he can do what he wants to do

265
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:28,490
that's gotta gotta be transcended in
order to make it really work it also is

266
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,370
keep forgetting all the employees the
company no matter what level no matter

267
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:38,200
what role to to sort of understand how
they are turning into the big picture in

268
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,110
my opinion that's the only way you begin
to defeat social engineering fishing

269
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,690
exercise if you get people to understand
their little insignificant role that

270
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,080
they think they have no impact on the
comp company really does have an impact

271
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:59,509
so what they do really does so in some
sense the question to start out with

272
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,019
whether it's in your own company you're
working for other companies try to

273
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:16,340
pinpoint where you are and so the
confession to make everything I've just

274
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:22,019
presented to you is from is verbatim
from the presentation that I put

275
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:30,759
together in my first commercial job
eighteen years ago they don't know maybe

276
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:33,990
put together these slides and run some
of them make them pretty but word for

277
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:41,210
word the same to stop and think about
that a minute I've given you eighteen

278
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:49,850
year old information that still valid
today and it's still daunting today and

279
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,159
really what's scary is when we used to
present this idea of the security

280
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,950
lifecycle eighteen years ago we were
talking in terms of 12 to 18 months life

281
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,539
cycle but the reality today the way
technology is moving is this life cycle

282
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:12,250
repeats itself months weeks days maybe
even hours

283
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:19,090
you know it's a moving target is really
fast faster than this whole day so what

284
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,350
really needs to change

285
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:32,050
understanding that you have a problem
like that first step to getting past the

286
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:38,600
problem that's really key getting past
the fact that a lot of companies don't

287
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,820
really care about securities securities
not our core competency and there's a

288
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,430
lot of companies out there especially in
the PCI world they have not nor never

289
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,330
will

290
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:57,990
dedicated security staff they might have
I T staff and then they have to do

291
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:05,300
double duty but within our industry we
sort of envision a certain

292
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,330
organizational structure that every
company has and that's how you do it

293
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,000
right

294
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,030
reality is many companies out there that
don't have that never will have that

295
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:22,830
which only compounds the problem our
security industry is largely vendor

296
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:28,860
driven and I'm saying this is a fender
benders lie I used to hate vendors when

297
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:37,300
I was a consultants what I've learned
now that I am offender is vendors are

298
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,920
always line and a lot of them do lie but
sometimes and often the vendors aren't

299
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,020
any more well-informed row we're hopeful
than anybody else that they're trying to

300
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,550
sell so they they repeat the buzz words
they repeat the marketing phrases but

301
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:59,190
they don't really understand the context
they don't know that there oft this much

302
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,280
the silence create lack of ownership
lack of responsibility

303
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,780
lots of finger-pointing I was spent 10
years not going to hacker conference is

304
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:16,100
coming to them over the last year to you
now that I'm outside of the bubble lot

305
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,560
of finger-pointing

306
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,780
I think there's a need for introspection
as well as finger-pointing be the

307
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:32,590
solution that you wanna be silenced two
pipes not not my problem it's somebody

308
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:39,750
else's problem and then you get this
whole well we're in business to make

309
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,720
money at the end of the day we lot of us
work for companies that are profit

310
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:51,920
driven and especially this is especially
problematic when your consultant and

311
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,460
advisor or an architectural engineer
working for a product or vendor and and

312
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,340
the recommendation recommendations for
the solution magically is that you're

313
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:11,250
selling so there's often times as
built-in conflict of interest

314
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:19,770
warranted some degree that we want
solutions we want the silver bullets

315
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:25,060
wanna do by something turn it on its
working and we don't have to think about

316
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:33,080
it so we can move on to something else I
would like to say suggest a vendor that

317
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:46,920
sells solutions that there really are
owners such thing as solution only

318
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,640
useful if they're being wielded by
people that know how to use them there

319
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,210
was an analogy made up for it he said it
this morning they were talking about new

320
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,220
do you want a house painter or do you
want to use someone who can paint a

321
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,660
masterpiece

322
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,820
where that analogy fell short there's a
whole bunch more demand in need for

323
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,620
house painters in the world than there
are people that complain amounts master

324
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,500
but the point is knowing how to use the
tools that you but there's a significant

325
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,640
need for people that have a basic
awareness and understanding of how did

326
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:31,310
not sure where that goes I just didn't
completely earlier than the traditional

327
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,230
view of network security the other
economies have a conversation outside a

328
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:41,130
little while ago the idea that you build
a castle wall you build a fortress you

329
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,220
put all your stuff do you want to
protect inside a bit and then everything

330
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,700
on the outside can't get in and that
whole mindset that whole sort of

331
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,100
paradigm of hell

332
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,230
network security works is kind of going
away

333
00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:00,930
has gone away because whereas the
perimeter these days when you have so

334
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,810
much technology in the clouds much
technology that spiritual so many

335
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,130
business critical applications are
running personal devices that are going

336
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:15,090
in and out of the network I worked from
home how many people work from home you

337
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:19,560
know your party or corporate network if
you happen to VPN in but very often

338
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:27,780
you're connecting to your mail whatever
its all its loud based business

339
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:35,710
applications so where is the perimeter
so again what I believe is the solution

340
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,490
not sexy and its doesn't mean you

341
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:52,420
the problem if you're your own company
working for a company if your customers

342
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,400
figured out what it is you're trying to
do

343
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:03,100
figured out what it is you're trying to
protect is a data is a reputation and in

344
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,900
making those decisions the definition of
risk assessment you have to make some

345
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,050
value judgments how much we going to
invest in the protection of this

346
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:20,580
protection of that how much you just
gonna have to deal with the education

347
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:27,750
awareness I can't come up with a better
solution than everybody needs to be

348
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,240
smarter at all levels of the
organization of law at all levels of the

349
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,650
industry

350
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:38,790
tell what the real risks are what the
problems are the challenges are this

351
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:43,790
community knows really well what can go
wrong and what can be done what can be

352
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:48,110
exploited that there's millions of
people out there that don't have access

353
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,450
to this and never will

354
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,809
they're not going to hire they're not
gonna bring it on but they have the same

355
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:58,110
problems that they're trying to solve
and there's a lot of people outside of

356
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:04,170
this community that are still within
what could be boosted security they care

357
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,400
about these things and are trying to do
the right things and they're trying to

358
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:16,010
make an impact in that sense I think
center before I'll say it again the

359
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:21,020
assigning blame to others it's really
easy especially when you're a group of

360
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,890
your peers it's developed

361
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:30,990
have secured yeah that's true but
there's more to it what can you do to

362
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:36,230
changed what can you do to make the
changes a lot of that starts with

363
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,730
education awareness don't assume that
the person you're talking to

364
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:47,550
understands the world that you wait the
way that you do don't soon even if

365
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:54,520
you're telling them they have a clue as
to anything you're saying I've been

366
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:00,800
giving this I'm actually trying to
develop what will be a training course

367
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,500
just trying to teach people as I've been
doing this for a lot a lot of years as a

368
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,650
consultant speaking the lots of
different types of people having to read

369
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,130
them having a try to understand the
language they speak having to speak

370
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,120
their learned to speak their language on
the fly

371
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,310
explain complex concepts things that we
don't necessarily think you're terribly

372
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,690
complex we take it for granted but they
look at us like you got snot coming out

373
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,410
our news they have no clue what we're
saying but explain it in a way that they

374
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:36,330
begin to understand painting pictures
using analogies speaking their language

375
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:42,270
trying to put together of course the
kind of helps to teach us know the

376
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:50,610
answer how to communicate that answer
other people all types first and

377
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:56,590
foremost saying this for years security
as a verb something you do not a state

378
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,510
it's not not someplace you get to and
you're done a lot of people want that

379
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,790
where they want to buy something that
gets in there don't have to think about

380
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:10,590
it I don't have intimate knowledge
direct knowledge new cribs came out with

381
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:15,899
an Oracle the last week or two about
what was going on at Target I suspect

382
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,850
and I haven't read the details on this
article

383
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:25,790
but I suspected were numerous multiple
failures and it what it appears is a

384
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:31,060
reputation of being one of the better
merchants actually had a pretty solid I

385
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,430
T staff they had a dedicated security
staff they invested heavily in

386
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:40,420
technology but I think they fell into
that trap we've got all these silver

387
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:45,970
bullets that were ok rather than
continuing to monitor and look at it and

388
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,580
realize the kind of information that was
at their fingertips they kind of the

389
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,630
scene today Roque as they had this great
panacea this false sense of security

390
00:34:54,630 --> 00:35:01,560
because they had it obviously that
didn't work too so in terms of your

391
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,270
where we go from here and this is again
this is meant to be just to get you

392
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:13,110
think get you thinking and approach this
whole prince with your thinking twice

393
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:20,310
about everything you're hearing how can
I expand and rethink this and this and

394
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:28,250
look at it in a different direction i've
seen it already this today there's a

395
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:33,220
severe need humility calling the people
that don't know what you know stupid or

396
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:39,810
dumb I don't think is appropriate as you
need to be able to speak to them because

397
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,910
often they are the ones that hold the
purse strings that the decision makers

398
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:52,690
and it's on it's on you to help them
understand there's more to it than pen

399
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,470
testing in hacking this is an important
component but there's a larger business

400
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:02,850
problem there's more things to go into
the hole to the whole package that helps

401
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:09,980
a company be secure whatever that is the
best way to learn how to

402
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:16,230
communicate to others is the first
listen some this is like basic a speech

403
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,369
class colleges persuasive speech

404
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:26,150
education where we all need to be
teachers we know we know more than the

405
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,260
next guy teaching we know more

406
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,410
we don't know what we know find out what
the next they might have something to

407
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:40,380
teach you as well I really like to talk
about security being a game I prefer to

408
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,410
think of it is a puzzle puzzles tend to
have solution there might be more than

409
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,410
one solution that there's a solution and
I'm not talking just about the

410
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:54,030
technology but going into a company and
having to learn what the corporate

411
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:58,230
environment is the corporate culture
being in a room with a group of people

412
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,119
and learning who the learning with the
power structure is learning who's really

413
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,450
in charge and influencers in a group
that's something that you know it's part

414
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:13,140
art form I think but I think there's
ways techniques that you can learn to

415
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,580
try to figure that out so that you can
read the company and give them the

416
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,640
recommendations that are tailored to
them that's again it's a communication

417
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,710
skill if your gonna be if you are in a
capacity of advising you've gotta be

418
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,640
trusted you need to be trustworthy you
don't usually gain trust again by

419
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,140
calling somebody stupider or snickering
out them if they ask to see the question

420
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,480
asks stupid questions yourself I used to
play dumb all the time

421
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,380
explain this to me I don't know how to
explain it to you got a lot of juicy

422
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,470
information about how the routers and
the rest in the networking worked

423
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:59,460
Company two great little too it's not a
stretch

424
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:05,830
perfect security is not a is not in 10
games not the desired state it's a

425
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,460
process that's ongoing

426
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:16,170
sprint certain amount of paranoia
paranoia is overboard with some of these

427
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,400
are just rambling thoughts

428
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:28,470
the overall goal is perfect security the
best thing you can do is monitor the

429
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,530
crap out of everything so you detect
early when something happens minimize

430
00:38:32,530 --> 00:39:14,920
questions feedback heckle anybody there
sir sir microphone proportion I don't

431
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:22,510
think the issue is it's not the issues
not the PCI standard and what PCR

432
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:27,190
requires you see more so is the way that
the industry has allowed people to game

433
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:34,980
the system and do the bare minimum just
to get a check box do so

434
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:43,020
way that against the the good PCI is
done or compliance is done in terms of

435
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,060
ten years ago when I got started in PCI
my first customer was a payment

436
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:52,920
processor one of the rather large ones
and there is credit card information

437
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,030
everywhere there was sensitive
authentication data to the three for

438
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,850
digis you know

439
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:04,870
by the millions in in rather log files
as somebody would turn on for

440
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,580
troubleshooting and never turned it off
I mean it was everywhere in every

441
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,040
company I went to data was everywhere

442
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,770
the accounting department the finance
department they wanted to do a database

443
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:23,170
query to get some information about her
transaction the previous week so the

444
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,780
most convenient search item was the
credit card so they would use out of the

445
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,740
search criteria and they didn't know how
to do you know efficient search and so

446
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,610
is just easier just dumped down all the
data on their laptop in on the share

447
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:43,590
drive I've been to too many companies
were everywhere so the game at PCI has

448
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:48,100
become limiting scope which means you
segment the network which means you

449
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:56,130
isolate your card data environment you
can argue that segmentation is a good

450
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:02,270
concept the game has become what what do
I limit things to so I don't have to

451
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,550
bother with PCI the benefit has been
they've had to understand how their

452
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:12,470
their network is working how the data is
flowing and and limited isolated and

453
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:17,070
clean up their mess basically and get it
down to a few places there's been a huge

454
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:22,440
benefit to that company's I didn't you
recently do a lot more lo and behold

455
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,580
they find out they don't need to keep
the credit card number at all and that

456
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:31,990
makes everything go away so you know
there's pros and cons there's certainly

457
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:37,810
a way that it's a large way the
compliance is being gamed and that

458
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,420
contributes to the problem again the
root cause i think is the lack of

459
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,740
education and awareness awareness having
Aqsa

460
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:51,630
altered come in and explain this is why
this rule exists this is why it's

461
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,160
important this is why you should take it
seriously in this is how you should do

462
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,260
it rather than just show me something
and I'll check the other questions just

463
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:21,619
a really tough question the question is
can I comment on coming up with ROI for

464
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:29,510
solutions to the real trick is if your
company has been broken into an

465
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:37,350
experienced the loss of a breach you
must be doing ok but there's no return

466
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,470
that or you don't know unfortunately
it's sort of an inverse you you know how

467
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:48,010
expensive it is when stuff goes bad and
how much that costs but it's really hard

468
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:54,180
to convince most people you know how
much they need to invest to prevent that

469
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,790
from happening you know there's all
sorts of formulas out there and

470
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:06,310
determining risk in and stuff like that
I had CEOs and CIOs and CTOs and I

471
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,680
talked to over the years were you ask
them what do you want your company's

472
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:16,880
name in the newspaper so I'm old school
what do you want them on trips to be the

473
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,440
next article and Crips and the like 10
of course not how much do you want to

474
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,380
spend to prevent that

475
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:29,690
what's appropriate there's really no
right answer to that question

476
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:45,799
start talking to put yourself out there
in the middle of lead by example don't

477
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:52,369
wait for somebody else to do it first
you might get the door slammed

478
00:43:52,369 --> 00:44:17,480
rhetorically but start doing it would be
my advice to begin in the classical

479
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:24,440
sense trained security was you develop a
policy which is sort of the ten

480
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,650
commandments thou shalt we're gonna do
this do this then you come up with

481
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:34,380
standards that say this is how we meet
this policy goal in this environment in

482
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:40,170
this platform this operating system or
application or system but even then it

483
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:44,359
still kind of high level without the
details but begins to drill down and

484
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:48,099
then the the the the highest drill down
as the the actual procedures were

485
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:53,930
actually this encryption algorithm can
use this key length we're gonna this is

486
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:59,700
how we're gonna do key management so on
and so forth so it kind of bills so the

487
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,049
idea of not being able to tackle it all
really goes up to the

488
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:11,429
figuring out what the problem is you
know what are the absolute in some ways

489
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:15,739
it's all the risk management what are
you gonna do what do you not gonna do

490
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:23,140
you think you can't do it then what in
your view what are your alternatives and

491
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:28,160
usually the alternative is know what's
going on your network monitor you know

492
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,969
maybe you can't stop everybody at least
try to detect it happened that makes

493
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:38,969
this and I'm not saying that just
because my company does monitor that

494
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:39,689
maybe I M

495
00:45:39,689 --> 00:46:06,559
any other questions a question you know
I think there's a lot of us that are

496
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,859
smarter that I think there's a lot of
this by no fault of our own especially

497
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:16,509
if you're new to the business we don't
always we older people don't always

498
00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:20,979
teach the historical context the meaning
what why do we do things a certain way

499
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:26,689
why is this good why is this dad we just
kinda latch onto all things have to be

500
00:46:26,689 --> 00:46:31,499
this way things had to be this way one
of the other talks I'd given his

501
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:38,199
lunabelle penetration testing I used to
do penetration testing I stopped for two

502
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:43,029
reasons one has the guys that I did
better than me and i said i remember the

503
00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:48,630
day when we were at a site and I found a
few vulnerable X servers and so I was

504
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,829
capturing keystrokes and I showed it to
the guy was with his oh yeah I wrote a

505
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:58,119
Python script I found ninety servers
monitoring right now

506
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:00,290
ok I'm done

507
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,570
but but the main reason I stopped was
because I got bored because like many

508
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,990
people that are penned testers you'll
hear this

509
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,910
find vulnerabilities that should have
been fixed shouldn't be getting into the

510
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:15,180
default password you shouldn't be
finding a default setting you shouldn't

511
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,690
be finding something that was turned on
it shouldn't been turned off or was left

512
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:24,700
on or you come back six months later a
year later and even though you told them

513
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,930
how bad it was

514
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:33,110
it's still there I decided gotta be a
different way to to go about doing this

515
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:37,980
especially being hired to be a pen
tester pen testing is a very expensive

516
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:45,530
inefficient way of doing they're
scanning technology that does that it's

517
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,430
where PCI is an interesting framework
PCI assumes that you build secure

518
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,860
networks he built secure servers you
hard and everything you securely

519
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,550
configured everything you've got
patching programs in place you've got

520
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:01,540
monitoring in place then you run the
skin shouldn't find anything but our

521
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,890
industry I know leads with the scanning
leads with the vulnerability assessment

522
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,100
and and and that's tied up in pen
testing as well and I'm not talking

523
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,510
about pen testing this hacking the
breaking stuff i'm talking bout pen

524
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,260
testing that's that usually ends up
finding vulnerabilities that there were

525
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:23,050
other more efficient ways of getting to
that point especially if somebody's

526
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:28,500
paying you to do it to answer your
question it'll yes we'll talk more

527
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:39,640
overburdened any other questions in the
back first

528
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:55,550
hoping I'm retired and i really often
sometimes wonder if we've gotten any

529
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,700
better i mean the technology changes we
plug one hole but a new one pops up and

530
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:04,920
and and they're sort of this built in
everything that exists in technology

531
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:11,000
these days is designed to be seen was in
fast information sharing kinda publicly

532
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
from wherever to wherever and oh by the
way responses protected so that there's

533
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,010
sort of this built-in it's always gonna
fail kind of thing so probably I could

534
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,670
give this talking

535
00:49:25,670 --> 00:50:47,210
yes one question I think it stopped
under wraps yes

536
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:53,290
largely done for the wrong reason and
it's largely ill-defined disorder talk

537
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:59,820
been recorded their son where the pen
testing time and time again is really

538
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:06,220
efficient and expensive way of doing
vulnerability is what pen testing should

539
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,170
be in again they mentioned it this
morning

540
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:13,210
pen testing should be imitating the
threat you've closed all your holes

541
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:18,760
you've done everything you can to patch
and and lock everything down then hire

542
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:25,140
the pen tester come in my experience
especially in the DoD implementation is

543
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:30,060
where things fall apart and that's what
needs to be tested but the emblem

544
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:35,460
implementation be tested by
impersonating the threat not and it's

545
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,300
not a matter of finding other
vulnerabilities the other point to make

546
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:44,660
is if you're doing pen testing your pen
test report finding should not be I

547
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:49,600
found a missing patch the system was not
patched thats not defining that's the

548
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,700
symptom the finding is your patch
management processes broken fix it

549
00:51:54,700 --> 00:52:00,140
because I found a bus you understand the
difference

550
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:27,430
our time as the next
