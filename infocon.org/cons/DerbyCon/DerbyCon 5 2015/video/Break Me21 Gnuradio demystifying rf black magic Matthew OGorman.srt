1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:03:38,020
now you don't really need a festival
seems like you can just go drink bourbon

2
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:56,150
hello everybody

3
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:10,570
slides there at the end of the slide off
your message so everybody my name is

4
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:22,060
mark silverman's fight video games and
my best friend like to solve problems

5
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:38,890
especially simple ones and I know what
the economic means no means I'm not a

6
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:47,390
doctor so I am in no way an expert on
anything I'm a tanker I like to work on

7
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:53,150
projects but don't take anything I say
today as dogma these are just my own

8
00:04:53,150 --> 00:05:00,050
personal experiences that I'm trying to
pass them on to you as best I can

9
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:10,940
so what is radio black magic
gobbledygook somehow you have power

10
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:19,220
comes in or out of an antenna closed in
the air makes twists and turns does

11
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,190
crazy stuff has all these words
associated with it that no one will

12
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,690
understand

13
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:35,310
ever and looting engineers who tell you
they do like the inside encompasses can

14
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,860
explain

15
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:43,389
so what I was saying radio is is
information that is in the air so that's

16
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:49,409
all going to go into the actual science
already has work just a way of getting

17
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:59,080
information from me to you about him and
so what is gonna radio

18
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,449
well clearly the software-defined radio
system but does that really mean it just

19
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:08,409
means there is a way of taking
information out of the air and bringing

20
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:13,550
into a system into a PC or a way of
taking a PC and putting information into

21
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:21,319
the air for someone else to receive
that's how the voters so the first

22
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,419
understand you have to before we had
software-defined radios we had

23
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:33,919
conventional radio so anything from TV
said car radio ham radios radar

24
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,680
everything you end up with devices that
were very low power because they were

25
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,389
very specialized they were only designed
to do one thing and they did it well

26
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:50,379
they would only work on their frequency
range they would only to code the type

27
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,430
of signal they were looking for

28
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,889
and because of that they were also very
cheap because they're just doing their

29
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:02,870
one job and they do it really well and
so for most things that actually is the

30
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,099
right way to solve the problem you want
to build things cheaply want them to be

31
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:13,039
efficient with their power usage and you
want them to do whatever the job you

32
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,300
sign it as well as possible but the
problem what if you don't know what you

33
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,639
want to do that's the same reason why we
have software for most of solving most

34
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,270
of our world's problems rather than
building hardware devices that song

35
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:35,300
because software so much more flexible
and we can we can react to problems much

36
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:42,029
faster and so software defined radio is
basically the opposite word of angry so

37
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,110
it's flexible

38
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:49,780
typically work overall a large range of
frequencies can deal with different

39
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:58,030
amounts of bandwidth has different spots
can do just about anything

40
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,460
one of the other problems with those
very inefficient so a software-defined

41
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:09,090
radio always use more power more CPU
time more memory for all your resources

42
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:15,760
than a hardware appliance and the other
thing is because of that expensive not

43
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,640
just in all those ways I just mentioned
but also to the cost of components the

44
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,620
complexity of your system just add price
is always going to be more expensive at

45
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,620
least for a single radio to a single
radio so for a lot of consumer devices

46
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:42,370
it probably so this right here is just a
screenshot video companion to simple

47
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:51,060
flow graphs and I'll go more into that
but a little daunting so take it back

48
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,710
for a second so this right here

49
00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:01,160
kind of defines what a radio looks like
you had the antenna which absorbs the

50
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,630
signal from the air the bandpass filter
is how you filter out the noise you just

51
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,890
getting the signal that you want your
gain stage takes this week electrical

52
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:18,460
signal makes much louder so that you can
actually see your mixer and local

53
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,370
oscillator is how you get things on the
clock sequence so that things are coming

54
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,980
in order the jute and then your ATC
converts the analog radio signal into a

55
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,540
stream of ones and zeros the computer
can understand and then the DSP is

56
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:43,640
analyzed that string of 10 what could be
like FM radio into actual audio out and

57
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:51,150
so a software-defined radio system to
bowl typically you have the hardware

58
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,070
side which is everything on that side
and then you have your software side

59
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,470
which is just a digital signal
processing and that's in the PC have a

60
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:09,000
device like an archaeologist Dr and a
software-defined radio

61
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,180
some some kind of dice to bring in the
analog signals from the real world into

62
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:22,080
the PC and then you'll have a program
like a new radio or aircraft are several

63
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,590
other programs that will analyze the
data coming in and making something

64
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:34,140
meaningful and so for those who have a
lot of hardware options the first is

65
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:44,480
this guy this is TV tuner card that they
sell it happens to have a radio inside

66
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,330
of it that you can hijack use a
software-defined radio

67
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:55,520
ranges and frequencies from route thirty
megahertz to 2.2 gigahertz with a few

68
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,590
holes in the inside you get to megahertz
of bandwidth out of it and it is

69
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:10,819
ridiculously cheap you can get them on
eBay for $30 or Amazon for round two

70
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:15,729
the one downside of it though is it is
only designed to receive signals cannot

71
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:22,289
transmit with it the next option next
step up by wednesday will be a device

72
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:27,209
like this this is a hacker f1 its
open-source piece of hardware

73
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:34,529
receiving or transmitting but not
simultaneously so tough to flex and it

74
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:39,859
works on signals from 10 megahertz all
the way to 60 hours so that's pretty

75
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:45,479
much anything most people want to play
with you got down like 900 X 2.4

76
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:50,809
gigahertz wifi signal F five years WiFi
signals you have a cell phones that are

77
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:54,249
in the four hundred and forty three
megahertz range you have a lot of remote

78
00:11:54,249 --> 00:12:00,850
control stuff and 2755 megahertz range
of useful bands that this can interact

79
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:07,470
with and then there's another device
called the blade RAF which is kind of

80
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,089
what the next I would say that someone
is the next step up from the grass and

81
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:16,259
that its full duplex a little bit more
expensive and it covers a little bit

82
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,970
less friends but 300 megahertz to 3.8
gigahertz pretty much covers most things

83
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,189
people want to tinker with I think so
it's a good option as well then there's

84
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:29,939
the first people that kind of like
pioneered this market was at us and they

85
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:35,189
sell very expensive very high quality
software defined radios that are

86
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:40,979
typically used in education markets but
not not something that happened by and

87
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:44,119
there are actually many more now have
entered the market there a lot of

88
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:51,569
options for hardware interface with and
so the first thing I tend to recommend

89
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:56,199
people just gettin RTL SDR they're very
expensive and you can figure out if

90
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:00,429
you're actually interested in so with it
like you can bring out the box you can

91
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:04,559
listen to FM radio you can listen to
like the No

92
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,269
Alert weather radio just like very
quickly

93
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,970
kind of just play around with what
signals are in your area and its funding

94
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,290
to get started with the next thing I was
just gonna happen

95
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:24,779
transferred some staff you can see more
signal and it's it's not that much more

96
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:30,860
expensive and then you really need to do
full duplex I think it's best to get

97
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,720
another hacker ass because you can use
to hardcore us to have a full-duplex

98
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,519
radio stack and so you're not wasting
any money although is a bit more clunky

99
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,370
to have them tied together I guess an
optional thing that I also recommend for

100
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,250
people especially anybody that has a ham
license are these little Baofeng radios

101
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:03,940
their costs almost nothing about this
$20 one day and it's an FM radio that

102
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:12,569
136 174 and 400 480 so it's useful
especially when you first off you can

103
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:17,769
broadcast and you can actually see it on
a real radio and listen back that's kind

104
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:24,920
of cool so next door hardware you're
ready to start receiving signals from

105
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,230
the rural

106
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,449
got some options for software you can
play with someone I'd recommend

107
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:36,959
everybody always start with is a program
called it gives a nice kind of fun and

108
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,420
they let you see a waterfall of all the
signals coming in and just kind of

109
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:50,000
quickly like play with some some real
radio and catchers signals STR sharp is

110
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,149
very similar program to use a lot of
Windows I don't use Windows on the whole

111
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:05,750
lot about it this program called air pro
that's pretty cool its it uses your str

112
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:12,089
and it allows you to see GSN traffic and
decoded to a degree so you can see

113
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:19,189
people's unique identifiers for example
like who's around your house

114
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:24,560
webradio nifty kind of tool it gives you

115
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,150
Python you have a web interface to your
St all so when I was on the road a lot

116
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:37,740
last summer set it up so that my STR was
listening to the baby monitor and then

117
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,470
from anywhere in the country I could go
to this web page and I could hear the

118
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,380
baby monitor pretty cool

119
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:51,470
LTE scanner is similar to a probe except
for its for LTE phones and then filing

120
00:15:51,470 --> 00:16:02,900
new radio Radio is doing everything so
let's get started so I really recommend

121
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:10,540
using a new installation rather than
doing some windows although most of the

122
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,900
tools existing Windows I think it just
works better

123
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:22,950
easy inside a Debian for example very
easy to install the software you need to

124
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:32,550
install this is the first thing I was
gonna show you all right now I have this

125
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,770
is a hacker F as well as just a fancy
case for to try to filter out some new

126
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,610
ones and I have plugged into my machine

127
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:54,370
we're going to say this is secure access
was talking about for right now I radio

128
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:35,380
to 93.8 the window a wider although it's
gonna be

129
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:55,430
so right now it hurts so I guess 91.5
all the way to 98.5 is being towed on

130
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,510
the PC right now but we're only actively
listening to this one in five hundred

131
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,290
kill her

132
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:08,260
section as I slide it over its just
instantaneous

133
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:24,010
2012 teen desperately go anywhere to put
your dick hurts like 24 10 that whole

134
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,650
popping up and down but the wifi traffic

135
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,930
its first around 20 megahertz

136
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,680
not seeing the whole single right now
this is just 88 megahertz window but

137
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,490
that those lips are all wi-fi packets
and this software isn't set up to the

138
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,050
coded but you can see that it's there
and you could go into the radio or other

139
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:50,870
figure out what you want to do so the
software is really good for just kind of

140
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,390
getting a feel for the area and seeing
what kind of signals words floating

141
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,120
around you

142
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,810
yes

143
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:09,360
ok so this is an artifact of the way
over to find radio works in Dec offset

144
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,730
spike and it's it's it's always there
it's always in the center of whatever

145
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:23,770
frequency and so the way to work around
it is actually like how I tuned in on an

146
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,870
offset of it you always offset to the
offset zone where the other so I wanted

147
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:41,400
to listen to that station which was like
if I wanted 294 294 it's really hard to

148
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,890
see that signal because it's right next
to offset its kind of being lost and so

149
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,030
though the way to always make sure you
get your signal is your shift the saw

150
00:19:50,030 --> 00:20:03,080
him to signal its just a defect in the
way the process works it's really easy

151
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:16,840
to work around like that but it's a
situation that the software also has the

152
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:36,550
ability to actually coming in around
later but it's just a matter of opening

153
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:42,270
acts

154
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:49,420
listening to radio is is pretty cool but
it's really nothing new I mean we all

155
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:55,850
have radios or actually I don't think
many of us even have radios so let's

156
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,610
let's make one instead

157
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:20,679
so for this accident to go into canoe
radio so I'm not sure how well you guys

158
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:27,910
read this at all so you have this the
way it outlined you have some blocks at

159
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,240
the top these are just like the
variables that are being set for the

160
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,299
program selector example audio gain how
loud the sound is gonna be as just set

161
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:45,040
you know the one what channel we
initially tuned to the basically saying

162
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,110
we have the frequency we're going to
tune into how wide the channel we're

163
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,460
gonna listen so they can for we were
listening to it 500 K

164
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,360
this time we're slightly narrower 200 K
the volume that we're gonna play back at

165
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,559
and what frequency we actually are gonna
head and then below here is where all

166
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,429
the work has really done so the first
thing we have to make on a block types

167
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:20,070
for getting information in and out we
have sources and sinks so because we're

168
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,150
going to be absorbing radio in this
instance we're going to take it into a

169
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:30,150
straight from the source and then where
do a few functions to it to massage the

170
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:35,970
data to get it into a audio signal and
then we're going to put it into a sink

171
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:43,120
the audio sync and so just a high-level
real quick what we do is we do a

172
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,080
low-pass filter which filters out before
with the harbourside with filter out

173
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,110
everything above and below I mean
everything above what we actually want

174
00:22:53,110 --> 00:23:01,370
to hear then we assemble it to the
families we want and then this is the

175
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:08,120
magic bit that understands FM Radio FM
signaling and that's really all there is

176
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:24,830
to it so when I saw this you guys have
these is to block

177
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,509
well

178
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:29,890
waterfall and see basically

179
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,360
looking at me

180
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:41,810
I think this

181
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:53,450
oh that's right there that's the DCI
offsets bike and so who are paying

182
00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:06,060
attention and we hit nothing there

183
00:24:06,060 --> 00:25:11,879
so change 95 take us closer to the
rights

184
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:54,129
understand explain so the variables like
those those blocks the don't actually

185
00:25:54,129 --> 00:26:01,099
have gates on either side and those are
set outside in like we were doing so for

186
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:05,739
example this is one variable that's in
every program essentially is the

187
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:15,559
sampling rate and it's what we're we're
processing the audio signal and so in

188
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:19,949
this case this variable was probably
from an audio source 44 point one color

189
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:27,709
for that and then the most common type
PCR these things called blocks they tend

190
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:33,049
to have an input and output is there you
know just massaging date on its way to

191
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:38,999
to someplace but then you also end up
with like the sinks and sources in the

192
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:46,889
most of the blocks are actually just
went along the path so the data types

193
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:54,410
that it knows about are all listed there
and so that's that's why

194
00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:03,890
year that's what all these color means
so it's a light blue which means complex

195
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:17,930
complex flow of the float 32 and so all
the blocks the data types have to match

196
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:24,220
and what's nice language has always
converter types so you can convert any

197
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:31,730
type any other type just like you would
any other program so now that we've

198
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:36,460
listened to FM radio when the beat

199
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,690
much cooler to broadcast FM radio and
the nice thing about that is actually

200
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:46,980
even simpler than so to build something
that will broadcast audio

201
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:52,270
it's pretty simple you have to give it a
source of information in this case I'm

202
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:59,750
using our way files and then I have this
multiplied constant walk because I want

203
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:06,520
to have the ability to apply gang to it
so the most by constant is currently one

204
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,630
that's taking a very variable audio
again so that when justice slider within

205
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:17,370
the program to make it louder and then
here we have this transmitted block

206
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:24,210
which takes the signal FM modulator then
we have this rationale block which

207
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:35,340
converts this 88.2 killer FM signal puts
it in the center of a larger signal

208
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:41,090
because the hardware and only broadcast
out of the two megahertz so with us to

209
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,400
megahertz sample pool we're broadcasting
with the small-signal in the middle of

210
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,490
it

211
00:28:46,490 --> 00:29:00,330
and this sink here is just so we have
you know what we're doing so right here

212
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:11,740
we are transmitting 165 megahertz and so
right in the center is where are our

213
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:18,480
song is you may want to guess what the
song is has something to do with

214
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:38,080
September 22nd on September 22nd at the
Happy Birthday finally entered the

215
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,740
public demand or didn't actually into
the public domain by the copyright

216
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:53,330
health Warner Brothers was rejected so
it's now ambiguous I say there's no one

217
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:58,970
right now and so that's what this is
doing we can adjust for its broadcasting

218
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:06,190
out by just sliding around just the
volume louder hundred to see on this

219
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:15,150
scale but her around the center

220
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:23,670
wider so that's how you build a
transmitter

221
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:31,930
so on other projects are not really
project but there's so many fun things

222
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,710
you can do with this that are a lot of
them are pretty easy like the

223
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:42,890
transmitter was so this July 4th my
family got together and we had this boat

224
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,770
race with these little remote control
boats the fun thing about them is they

225
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:54,280
operate at 27 megahertz and they just
broadcast a simple FM modulated signal

226
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:02,860
that says go for go back go right and so
I took one the remotes and I just listen

227
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:12,180
to it for a bit and I started off so
here I basically come to programs

228
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:17,070
combined have this one program that's
the great out program means that it's

229
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:23,750
not active right now and so I had by a
hacker set at the frequency of the boat

230
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,060
and I brought it in and then I just
wrote down all the information I

231
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,390
received to a file so what I did was I
took the remote and I hit you know the

232
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,440
controls for and then I read that to a
file called for and then save the file

233
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,610
change it backwards backwards and so
then I had copies of the signal for the

234
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:49,680
boat going for going backward all the
different states of the boat and

235
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,000
because the boat was so simplistic you
didn't have to do anything just a replay

236
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:04,210
replay the information back and so I set
it up to keep repeating go for two which

237
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:10,150
caused the boat a little bit and I just
raced with all my brothers and one every

238
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:16,350
race because they're both kinda just
drifted and they couldn't figure it out

239
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:22,060
until my little brother got frustrated
and dropped the remote his boat kept

240
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,730
going and the kind of hard on

241
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:34,490
but it was fun while it lasted but it
was his real straightforward easy to do

242
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:42,530
but it's really easy to build these more
complex programs because you're really

243
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:49,580
just building these photographs they're
pretty simplistic and inside a radio you

244
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:55,440
get all of these blocks to begin with so
you can do a MFM STC DVD IMF's escape

245
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,370
TCP UDP

246
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:04,110
Kodak 250 tons of different ways you can
get did it in and out of the software

247
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:12,150
and what's even cooler is an ass

248
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:18,590
yeah the pro level there's AC grand for
any radio and so people have written

249
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:25,870
models that integrate very easily and so
like there's ready a devious 20 p25

250
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:32,500
Bluetooth looted totally different cell
phone technology wifi so it's really

251
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,140
easy to take any one of these blocks and
integrate them into your own code and

252
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,300
work with it

253
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:50,960
yeah so so what's great about in
particular there is a lot of those the

254
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,340
moving the frequency hopping they still
do within a a small domain so the

255
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:04,310
Bluetooth frequency hopping I believe is
I want to say it's around 20 megahertz

256
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:09,680
window so the hacker asked and received
20 megahertz window she just absorb the

257
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:17,590
whole window and you follow it you can
see it all the other way around that if

258
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:23,530
it's if it's a bigger window this two
kinds of attacks you either the protocol

259
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,250
enough so that you can follow the
frequency hopping as well because you

260
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:34,850
can change your frequency window as
early as fast as well as well or you

261
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:41,330
just build a system that you can absorb
all the signals so one of the projects

262
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:47,460
some people did you read our Community
early on was the police scanning the

263
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,120
police scanners work on a frequency
hopping system over I think like 16

264
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,290
minutes but people at the time just had
these guys guys just absorber to

265
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:05,140
megahertz signal which is really only
wide enough for a single channel what

266
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,780
they were doing and so what that there
are kind to attack people did one attack

267
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,970
was people got ten of these chain demand
that all spectrum and misguided and then

268
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:21,730
somebody that was clever reverse the
protocol enough to where he could have

269
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,950
two of them one that watch that control
channel and listen to where it was

270
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:35,070
supposed to go and the other to change
the way so the next program that I kind

271
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:40,150
of worked on I'm gonna I think it's like
the Nifty is product in the world except

272
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:48,480
for that its proprietary it's this
little VHF radio that an encrypted

273
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,550
signal over the age of two Bluetooth Low
Energy to your phone and so their ideas

274
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:59,150
that might send text messages without a
cellphone network within a smallish area

275
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,060
so like concerts or if you were going
like rock climbing up the middle of

276
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,560
nowhere you could keep in touch with
people that were in your group with just

277
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:14,610
text but what intrigued me was encrypted
and was kind of wide range around a few

278
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:22,650
miles range using this protocol called
murders a standard mir's where you're

279
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,310
allowed to turns out that the only one
out there that's for citizens were you

280
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,400
can encrypt your traffic free and so I
thought that was really cool

281
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,059
and so I wanted to kind of build
something similar to it myself and i got

282
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:48,799
working on I didn't want to talk to
people to text so what I have here is

283
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:53,819
kind of a more complicated program I
used one of those blocks from Ground

284
00:36:53,819 --> 00:37:02,529
that I was talking about the new radio
salt NaCl the same Python library that's

285
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:07,440
forgotten real popular lately for doing
crypto and I also use something that's

286
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,109
built into a radio call codex it's going
to sound a little bad but it's a 3.2

287
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:25,720
killing two of its a second so it's
really small and so the way this one

288
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:32,520
works is similar to our FM transmitter
we have a file coming in and I'm

289
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,829
throwing it out to this thanks we can
see the sound file as a visual

290
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:43,779
representation and then another thing
here we're shifting it into a data type

291
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:50,460
this is like how some up for changing
the data type from Oslo to casting it

292
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,099
down into a short and so I'm kind of
throwing away some of the data in

293
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:59,680
compressing it but having to lose some
of the day and doing that and then I use

294
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,900
this codec to audio encoder which just
converts the waves uncompressed WAV file

295
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:12,319
into this small codec then we vectorized
it and turn it into a stream so this is

296
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:17,680
a condition of it this is this is
massaging the files that can go into the

297
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,940
trip to stack and then after out of the
creek the stack train into a packet and

298
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:30,859
in from a packet it goes to jim has K
which is a frequency encoding model

299
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:33,349
simply this is how a lot of the

300
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:39,890
data center in the air you'll hear that
sounds like modem times when you

301
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:44,150
actually listen to it and so what's it
about this program is this is just a

302
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,170
test program I wrote so actually never
go into the air

303
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:52,229
this is all just done on the PC and
never leaves the memories the PC so used

304
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,769
to be ready to actually don't have to
have any hardware only if you actually

305
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:59,519
want to transmit to the world and so
then I'm basically doing the exact

306
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:04,470
opposite process of converting it out of
Jameson k taking it out of a packet

307
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,710
running it back to the crypto

308
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:15,509
converting it from Kodak to back to
regular audio and then converting it

309
00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:19,349
back into a float and then back up the
audio sync and then I'm running it

310
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:23,519
through the 50 block again so we can see
how the audio has changed once it's

311
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:28,430
passed through this whole process
because it's it's like mp3 encoding and

312
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:34,119
it's not only gonna change the sound so
this is me singing happy birthday

313
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:57,380
converted to connect to encrypted and
then converted back out there and

314
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:04,660
although I don't think that it's
certainly intelligible and it's it's

315
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:23,510
it's unbreakable except for the fact
that he currently is ABC but questions

316
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:37,790
yes one of the cool things about me
radio is when you compile this so docs

317
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:49,070
radio so the new radio opinion is
actually just an interpreter directly

318
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:56,890
into Python so this salt test the GRC
files what we've been looking at jenner

319
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,180
every time I think compiler generates
this python watch and the way to do it

320
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:28,310
without a GUI so like I come here and I
just passed so that's just so if you

321
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:36,540
want to just take out so we have this
one top lock but you can actually change

322
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:43,350
the same Nokia we have a good way and
then you just don't call in the fifties

323
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:48,080
the pretty good functions that I was
just a command line based thing and

324
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,750
that's how some of these other tools I
talked about Rex adult like the web

325
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,410
radio

326
00:41:52,410 --> 00:42:04,510
tool is actually just a radio compiled
file that doesn't have a good yes so I

327
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:11,760
radio so one of the plugins excimer use
encrypted you can't get that but there

328
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,260
are satellite different satellite
systems that are free to air and their

329
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,940
people that I'm not to cook them but
running coat them with the Stars

330
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,890
software the support for STC in STC

331
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:32,420
different different transmission schemes
that people actually

332
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:53,550
so when they say 27 they're not actually
at 23rd so it was actually his was

333
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,380
actually in 27 minutes exactly but mine
was at 27.5 megahertz there's all stamp

334
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,790
that way and they're all made really
cheaply so I think we have like four

335
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,130
boats and two of them were on the same
because they just don't care

336
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:27,510
$8 vote yes there are here that kind of
can help with that there's like message

337
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:32,440
tools we can do I kinda printf
statements as things are going by and

338
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,070
then like for example if you actually
have something was broken by disabled

339
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:40,710
list block it has a smart nothing to the
already tell me that this won't compile

340
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:47,420
because throttles pointing to know where
every block has to terminate someone and

341
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:53,010
then this this has its own compiler they
will tell you why thanks break if you

342
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:58,410
break things but you can also like I
said before the house just pipe on you

343
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:05,270
can run this in Python and see see why
banks of breaking but I was it's pretty

344
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:11,410
stupid stuff what makes it part of my
stuff is especially if you're working

345
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:16,470
with another system you really when
you're starting off with your attacker

346
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,670
your understanding what you're working
with you really wanna make sure you get

347
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:26,500
captured others there's a plugin called
file sync and you want to copy

348
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,040
whatever you're listening to see you can
replay it within the system itself

349
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:35,310
because you don't know when something
transfer again and so that can be really

350
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:41,090
frustrating like there's a train track
near my house and when the train comes

351
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:46,000
by the actually signal about half a mile
ahead of time trying to come by

352
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,350
shut the gate and AW really cool to have
like some way to alert me like don't go

353
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:57,580
that way because the trains gonna be
there but it took me forever to get

354
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:03,630
anything working because I had to listen
when the French and its before the train

355
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:10,190
comes by the message sent and so I had
something to log all of the data for a

356
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:17,810
long time before I had a clear signal
that connects interpret any other

357
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:29,730
question so no it's actually it's pretty
clever how they do it

358
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:37,700
the signal for lowering as I don't think
it's actually in the air I think it's

359
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,930
just serve for things to know that it's
coming I don't know why it's not

360
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:55,130
referring to actual gate I think they
could trigger a mechanic that scary and

361
00:45:55,130 --> 00:46:03,210
maybe that's an extra resources there is
a suburb called RTL SDR which is a good

362
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,240
place to start

363
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,700
starting Great Scott gadget accomplices
Dr he's the guy that makes the hacker F

364
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:15,850
and he has some videos that go actually
in depth about how some physics stuck

365
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:19,950
work but you never know

366
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:26,540
there's bound to be radio on the free no
network they're really helpful people

367
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:33,490
they're really cool place to hang out
and all the all the pope that displays

368
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,410
on I get home page

369
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:43,829
FCC doubts this is especially if you're
trying to reverse engineer something

370
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:49,810
anything that has a radio in it they
have to provide SEC with copious amounts

371
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,839
of information about how the system
works like what frequency its out what

372
00:46:53,839 --> 00:47:01,980
anything your 10 sei 0 easy way to
search and find the products that you're

373
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,650
actually working with and you get tons
of information right off the bat is a

374
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:12,109
very cool website I didn't know where I
was gonna put the slide this is just the

375
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:19,329
frequency allocation from three
kilohertz all the way to $300 hurts so

376
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:29,760
that's how the government has divided up
the spectrum information and how to get

377
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,270
flights
