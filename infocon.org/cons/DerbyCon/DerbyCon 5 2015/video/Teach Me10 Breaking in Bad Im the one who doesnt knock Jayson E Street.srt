1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:51,320
just you know fYI so the job security
trolling online right now

2
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:06,590
advertising so how we doing

3
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:20,780
come over here an impressive you're
quick

4
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:33,710
like you know be too violent for me this
is my legal disclaimer I am NOT a lawyer

5
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:40,670
I have played one on the internet before
but I am really not a lawyer so I do

6
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,979
most of my legal disclaimers to google
image searches and basically this is

7
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,770
quite simply during my talk I'm going to
talk about some really bad things I've

8
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,170
done some really horrible things that
I've committed and and to the whole time

9
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,530
you have to realize that it's like I was
under contract the people paid me to do

10
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,119
that and so remember the kittens are
adorable ok I will never tried to steal

11
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,819
from you kill your financial destroyed
unless you pay me first so it's all good

12
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:14,000
so so when I think when I tell you some
of these things and there's a couple

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,080
stops in here where you really like how
Jason that's pretty all the kittens in

14
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:28,079
Warren this is my talk title and this is
also the bombing the cursor is over

15
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:34,180
there can see cursory look at that Tim
Pearson was nice enough to hook me up

16
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,930
with the fancy logo which is defense is
part of this whole talk right there

17
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,920
boom that's entitled breaking in bad I'm
the one who doesn't not basically what

18
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,540
does talk is about it's like I've given
several social engineering talks and I

19
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,730
have done some really weird crazy what
are you serious things during my career

20
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:04,730
I have the the luxury of not having that
as my primary motive means of income so

21
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,690
I can actually say you know when
something comes of age acing can you

22
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:13,269
break into this truck factory in the
morning I want and like busy right now

23
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:14,650
so I can't do that one

24
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,579
hey Jason can you break into this star
star hotel in the South of France yeah

25
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,540
I'm available for that yeah I can do
that

26
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,840
hey can you bring this we got this car
insurance company and the view texts can

27
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,930
you can book right now it's like well
there's this bank in very limited and

28
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,349
available I can do it so it's legit some
really weird things that have occurred

29
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:44,340
one of the biggest problem when you see
when I talk about when we hear someone

30
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,269
talking about exploits and development
of like 20 days and things that they can

31
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,200
show you the demos and stuff on that
right they can show you things actually

32
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,299
doing the things you can see social
engineering to get on part of that so

33
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:01,079
what this talk I wanted to do was
actually at least a couple times provide

34
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,900
you actual pictures and video of me
doing a social engineering engagement so

35
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,510
you actually get to see some of the
things that like no he did oh wait yes

36
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,950
he did so that's what that's about

37
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,599
I don't really may I don't really need
to do a bio you can find that on Google

38
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:24,030
unfortunately more stuff than I care to
admit this is the big part though I want

39
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,539
to start off with pole apt thing and so
you know every drink advanced persistent

40
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:33,599
threat is basically what pic companies
tell their their shareholders when they

41
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:36,990
get popped by fishy explains stuff you
know when they don't want to lose any

42
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,449
money or stock it was an advanced and it
was persistent and we work we felt very

43
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:46,340
threatened it was it was horrible and
how they get in we had to go injection

44
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,720
for the last five years on the website
oh nice be going right

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,570
so screw that it's like stop talking
about advanced persistent threat when

46
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,460
you gettin pop and and stop talking
about low hanging fruit I hate hearing

47
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,970
people talk about well they're going
after we got to the low-hanging fruit

48
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,490
screw that there's

49
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,640
on the ground people ok it's like these
guys are going after the first they're

50
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,500
not reaching that hi there bending over
and picking up their backs hurting from

51
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,140
all the fruit they have to pick up from
the ground

52
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,890
ok but its I wanna do you think that's
first ok you can start worried about the

53
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,450
low-hanging fruit ok get some people
like a bad backs and you got to be

54
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,740
considered at least make them reach Fort
so that's one thing that gets me so I

55
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,630
think I don't do a company when I go
into a company I don't don't do this all

56
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,550
this advanced of life while ago and I'm
gonna go through this I'm gonna do a

57
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,850
pretext on the creek as I didn't know as
I walk in and see if I can get away with

58
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,540
stuff really think yeah and it works and
that way they don't have any excuses

59
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,590
they can't say oh this is this guy doing
all this really far advanced motion

60
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,680
detection needs it's like oh he
seriously just did that and he got away

61
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,660
with it so I do basic adorable
destruction

62
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,570
I just walked in and try to be bad
that's it nothing more fancier nothing

63
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,930
that I do the least I like to say that
I'm trying to be less advances I code

64
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,700
word for I'm lazy and just like to do
that much preparation and I'm not

65
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,210
organized very well I don't adult very
well it's a problem so I just walk you

66
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,530
can usually be bad I hear some
indicators for a person being bad

67
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,110
recon mode is only about two hours of
Google and victims on website

68
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,940
have never used two hours the longest
I've ever used one hour and 45 minutes

69
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,140
and that's actually one of the stories
in this number to see motives using

70
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,960
walking into the victims location and we
don't sometimes without doing number one

71
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,760
literally seriously that's one of our
stories and then three punishment is

72
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,560
basically plug in the device the
victim's computer network sometimes with

73
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,200
your help

74
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,930
do I really need to help when I'm doing
it know but it's funnier that way and

75
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,950
that's the way I do i mean living that
is the only reason why do that

76
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:10,660
step 45 profit you know cuz the check
clears and I'm happy here hopefully they

77
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,240
learn something so they're happy so
everybody profits rhamat you know not as

78
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,370
happy as others so these are the three
best approaches that I use when I do my

79
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,130
break ins first I do the passive role I
go in his attack repair guy delivery job

80
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,500
and customer orders wander and that's a
passive mode because I'm asking you for

81
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:39,130
help on the idea of trying to this
number get this in and it worked out

82
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,640
really well

83
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,240
wanna be helpful as like but I do have
to have warned you don't like when

84
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,790
you're going in as these kind of roles
special like the tech repair make sure

85
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,320
you know how to do what you do

86
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,100
ok because I never go in as a plumber
and miss you know how the plan

87
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:59,870
ok cuz you never know when someone goes
like oh I'm here for the stuff we're

88
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,050
ready

89
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,710
actually had problems with that not as a
plumber thank goodness I've never gone

90
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,789
into the plumber I'm not that you know
carry over to auditor executive possible

91
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:15,310
that's the aggressive role that's where
I'm feeling more more authority of on

92
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,879
trying like projected more I'm trying
like you have to do something for me and

93
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,879
usually that works out well because
they're usually making me wear a tie

94
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,270
your mother let me work tired and I'm
gonna make you pay for it

95
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,709
ok seriously ok nothing against the
snappy dresser guys and stuff you know I

96
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:36,599
just don't like wearing ties and suits
and stuff no I'm not part of the man so

97
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,260
it's like when you make me wear a tie
its like you definitely understand is

98
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:47,540
that you shouldn't let me wear a tie and
its traces can you help me here and try

99
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,510
to get something I need access to serve
Rimmel well if you understood that this

100
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,329
was a surprise inspection you to
understand why you don't know that I

101
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:03,160
need to serve the key not give it to me
now are put you on the report I don't

102
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:15,470
have all day thank you and there you go
so very crazy off the wall personalities

103
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,940
not recommended but totally fun and they
usually work I'd literally broke into a

104
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,870
star Palace Hotel in the South of France
barefoot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

105
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:31,370
pajama bottoms and a hacker t-shirt it
was also I had full access to their

106
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,209
underground facility the computer rooms
the age our area like the employee

107
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:41,450
sections the food preparation services
everything and the whole time I was

108
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,470
walking through the security cameras you
know filming I didn't have my camera

109
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,420
documented so I needed documentation so
I just one brother Cameron who like this

110
00:09:51,420 --> 00:10:01,950
they really got pissed about that but it
was hilarious and I need to get out I

111
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,250
need to leave instead of going the way I
came because you know that would be

112
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,930
boring I went up to the room service guy
the guy I just went up to him and I was

113
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:31,070
like to be here I sit here how do I get
out of here this is not here and neither

114
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:37,900
she nor did he put me in the employee
elevator that turn into the first work

115
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,860
behind the registration and in the front
desk into their own offices their

116
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:50,490
business offices so by myself he just
put me there like good luck they go and

117
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,520
its life and so I get in there and I'm
in the business office and be like oh

118
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,070
there's an unlocked workstation oh
there's a hotel she's it was a five star

119
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,290
hotel they provided everything so so
that actually work so those are fun

120
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,870
we're gonna do so what I decide to do

121
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:17,600
is i three financial institutions in
three different countries using three

122
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,490
different roles go through each one of
the roles from three different countries

123
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,870
to show you just exactly how screwed we
are because you would think the

124
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,279
financial place you know that's where
the money's at

125
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,860
you know that we like you know hey let's
do some security so people don't think

126
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,950
money right the first was the passive
role this is what's called finally the

127
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,100
beirut bank job it was so hilarious
actually turned it into a comic strip

128
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,880
which was cool

129
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,980
basically what this was was we were
trying to show them how a on-site

130
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:55,839
physical compromise could relate to a
actual digital theft like you know doing

131
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,529
a wire transfer money over the water how
could you do that how could you actually

132
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:06,089
get we decided that thing to do online
theft you when the user I D a password

133
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:10,990
a smart card a computer and their
internal network access right to get

134
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:16,770
that so they decide to randomly drive
means they chose the bank branch's I've

135
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:22,279
never been there before and they drove
me to three different bank branches to

136
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,200
see what I can do much damage I could do
let's see how that worked out for him

137
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,020
this is the first branch if you look at
the time stamp on the upper right hand

138
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,130
corner and you look at the bottom you
realized from walking into this branch

139
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,290
in Beirut Lebanon the very first time
before getting into the the branch to

140
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,160
have full access to everything and
installing malware two minutes and 22

141
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,630
seconds not only two minutes 20 seconds
before having full access please note

142
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,550
the fact I'm wearing a black leather
DEFCON jacket and red Thunder cat to me

143
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,330
she's during this engagement I come with
warning labels so and when I say that I

144
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,379
had full access I literally had full
access

145
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:10,720
to the whole facility then one of the
customers he was actually to possibly

146
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,289
$200,000 in cash at the time that's his
money on the on the back so what I did

147
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:22,839
was I just walked in was not always the
best thing to do sometimes you run into

148
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,649
dead ends and that's always awkward but
you know that's what my things I usually

149
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:31,199
handle it so it looks trade-in down the
hallway and I see the manager's office

150
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:35,629
and I stopped cuz manager at someone in
there and I wait 30 seconds right

151
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:40,329
outside his office after 30 seconds I
walk to the executive office

152
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:47,699
headquarters are trying to work on your
USB right to make sure the domain admin

153
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:54,709
stuff you know USB writes itself may not
reflect the IBD 64 lock up and stuff you

154
00:13:54,709 --> 00:14:01,399
know the domain controller so it's like
the facts about you know just ramble

155
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:08,299
just enough good right so you like it
it's like she gets about computers let

156
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:14,309
me plug in the device inside the rubber
ducky on a just and and I do in command

157
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:17,859
prompt comes up I take an actual
physical camera out take a picture of

158
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:21,419
your screen with a plan property showing
that I actually have access like thanks

159
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:27,289
very much and she thought I was talking
to the bank manager now everybody in the

160
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,839
teller earlier he saw me talk to the
manager

161
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,539
wracked with the executive so I go to
the other lady I'm like that's why the

162
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:45,299
teller and I'm like hey look on the
jurors' insert whatever you want and

163
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:50,029
they liked and they let me know they're
actually make that gentleman get out of

164
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:54,180
his chair to install the USB Drive the
rubber ducky onto his computer

165
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,170
and it didn't trust me I was not afraid
of any of those employees that customers

166
00:14:59,170 --> 00:14:59,960
scared me

167
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,160
ok but what I'm going through there and
I went and I just and then the manager

168
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,630
comes out about 10 minutes later I was
there for over 20 minutes as I do

169
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,970
comes out about 10 minutes later he sees
me doing all this stuff behind the

170
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,570
teller line stuff you know the death of
me I was actually calling and there's

171
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,980
video calling in the chair and stuff it
was amazing I have a DVD I can't help it

172
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,010
and so he goes well what's going on with
a court ruling on the machines like oh

173
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,649
we got a problem with one of our
computers come take a look

174
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:37,520
not a plumber so I can do desktop so I
go over and look at his computer stuff

175
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,760
you don't like do you know what this is
this is this doesn't work out well we'll

176
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,740

185
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,680
whole office and he's like

186
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:36,060
and I'm like yeah it's awesome so let me
just go do that I had you like the only

187
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,260
place I couldn't get into was double
wall and I tried so hard

188
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,540
ok I was i jus let me have access like
me go into the vault make sure there's

189
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,560
no network adapters know is just a
straight ball games on there are you

190
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:56,140
sure can look just a little bit just
never let me in I was sad about that I

191
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,850
was sad about afterwards because what I
do in these engagement I don't do read

192
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:07,880
to me I don't do the customer rating
right go in but a report and then done

193
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,540
it's like I do security awareness
engagements ok I've been social

194
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:18,559
engineering it's like awareness it's
like I go when I go and then I'll leave

195
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,540
that I wake two minutes outside the
facility after have compromised it and

196
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,900
after that two minute I walked back
again and I talked to all the people

197
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,710
that are compromised and explain to them
why I was a bad person that way instead

198
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,390
of three months later when they get a
memo that something bad happened three

199
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,050
months before they actually get it that
actual teachable moment right there and

200
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,690
understand that's why so bad they
learned something from that and

201
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:51,120
hopefully they learn in the keep it they
are better protected because up so at

202
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,670
the disengagement let's just say this
one was so bad I waited till the bank

203
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,540
branch totally closed it wasn't because
I was afraid of that guy just a little

204
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,120
bit way to the branch was closed and
then everybody came together

205
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,059
and one of the executives with him so I
don't speak French Arabic ok I don't

206
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:14,950
blend well and it's like there was an
executive spoken Arabic just so

207
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,450
everybody would understand exactly how
bad this loss and so I'm going around

208
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,090
talking to him why did my was bad stuff
you know and then the bank manager

209
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:36,610
halfway through like crazy and I'm like
yes this is what these computers are

210
00:18:36,610 --> 00:19:29,159
still getting the computers right

211
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:43,409
I was kicking a puppy dog was bad

212
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:50,149
ok it was really bad for it was a really
bad situation but they learned something

213
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:54,080
from it because they need to learn
something from it because I was there

214
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,129
for over 20 minutes killing all their
documentation from behind the teller

215
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:02,659
line also the guy in the snappy sweater
vest was nice enough to give me his user

216
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:08,460
I D gabys employing ideas password and
his smart card cuz they had two factor

217
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,749
authentication with us

218
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:15,529
boxes so the United the smart card and
the passing yardage like that's really

219
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:21,210
secure well into you have someone asked
nicely I guess so I did that so what do

220
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,399
I have now I have three out of five
things right the first branch ride I

221
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:32,809
have a smart card use your idea in a
password what else do I need her and

222
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,720
network access so let's go to the next
branch once again never been there

223
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,440
before

224
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,720
walked in I felt so guilty about saying
all those wires and heard that guy's

225
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:50,869
feelings that I didn't bother to say one
word to anybody at this branch I

226
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:56,279
literally walked in I knew where I was
going to the break room into the break

227
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:04,159
room which was good because people are
still work to get a drink water weight

228
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,109
because you don't just all measures are
going to get people associate that

229
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:12,919
you're there and you're just going in
you go any way around this coming from a

230
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,820
different direction you're more
authenticated or more authorised so I'm

231
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,249
literally go from the breakroom straight
behind the teller line while the guy is

232
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:27,900
conducting business right beside me and
I unplugged the computer

233
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:38,810
and take it with me not one word was
said during that it pays to the adorable

234
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:46,600
I guess right so now we've got your I D
password smart card and the computer how

235
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,250
hard was it to get network access

236
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:57,570
go to the the third branch hey I'm here
with just let me just let me that work

237
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:05,150
ok so I was able to relatively pretty
easily show just because you think you

238
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,480
protect your computer and your network
you don't have to worry about the

239
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:16,800
physical aspects of security just a
little bit so the next part is the

240
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,950
authority of role and I was actually
tasked subcontracted out of a great

241
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,820
company to do a test on the state by
state treasury somewhere in the united

242
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:35,780
states already and they want to go in
because the network side of the team the

243
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,860
actual teams I had actually totally
destroyed them just like made him say

244
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,910
mommy and everything was it was really
sad and they're like what you'd have to

245
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,880
be inside to get a lot of this day there
are you hiding all the stuff like ok

246
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,050
Jason want to come in and try to
breaking inside and journalism sounds

247
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,000
like fun 'cause you know that's
interesting maybe in the United States

248
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,400
but the state treasury could do that so
I go to the headquarters and

249
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,510
Headquarters out wow you would think
just people deal with the money they're

250
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:09,320
okay because it was like a nice change
in Windows around the building secured

251
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,340
there was a lobby with I he had to go
through this one door that was like

252
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,280
there's a lady there was another locked
door and you can just walk in I did find

253
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,269
a vulnerability though it's like there
was in the basement where there was a

254
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:26,739
lunch area there was a storage area and
there was a dumb waiter that wasn't

255
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:30,099
sealed so you could actually climb
through the dumb waiter and get to the

256
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:33,809
first floor and access into their
internal area but after further

257
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,899
inspection of the dumbwaiter I can
inspire so therefore was impenetrable

258
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:46,049
and cuz once again we had to talk about
scope and horseradish go so they won

259
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:54,059
that round ok they won that round ok but
they also had a office in another office

260
00:23:54,059 --> 00:24:00,289
building 50 miles away less likelihood
of spiders so let's go check that out

261
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:06,269
right so I go over there and I'll check
it out and his beautiful because they

262
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:11,190
think they don't think logically they
think in a logistical they think

263
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:16,259
physical oh this building is separated
from our headquarters and I'm like no

264
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:16,889
other

265
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,969
you got under reg D one like I could be
sitting in this office and right next

266
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:21,440
year

267
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,409
your treasure at the same time it's from
the logistical standpoint I'm on the

268
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:27,179
same network

269
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,459
you got it directly tied into your
internal network this is not an external

270
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:38,009
office this is part of your headquarters
but they didn't see that at first so I

271
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,070
children's I told him that we going to
do this and this is worth comes in

272
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:48,599
because investors realize it was gonna
feel this one right cuz when you go to a

273
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,359
client you let him know is I didn't
attack attack you this is their scope

274
00:24:53,359 --> 00:25:00,279
they've got all this to attack you with
and client goes yes I like an attacker

275
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:06,349
would be awesome but we can only do it
Monday through Friday and stuff you know

276
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:07,529
because the staffing

277
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:17,529
ok but like an attacker would ok but
before midnight because of our processes

278
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:23,090
ok but a girl like her would you got it
I'll do that

279
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:28,070
but production servers because you know
their tragic as we've been passing on

280
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:34,260
the way you know what there's IP address
and got her a developer go out attack is

281
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:41,110
like an attacker would and you like sure
that real-world simulation right there

282
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:46,320
you're gonna see exactly the hell and
fury attack and one leadership on this

283
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:53,000
one IP address on this development
server Tuesday at Ford you got it very

284
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,390
ago

285
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,500
well the state treasury was a little bit
more narrow and their scope you shall we

286
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:06,990
say they made it where I could only go
in after 5:30 at this branch I couldn't

287
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:12,300
use my favorite lock picking tools
cardboard or crowbar to get in I'm not

288
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,380
really good with clock ticks but I'm
also a cardboard and you know crowbars

289
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:21,150
pretty self explanatory but these are
the rules of engagements I could talk to

290
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,270
no one coming in or out of the building
because they may not be a state treasury

291
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:32,020
employee sure that's legit 2 I can only
stay in the public areas if I didn't get

292
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:37,670
in three I can only talk to the cleaners
but I was not allowed to lie to them

293
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:44,110
because they weren't direct employees
and of course but at a cost like an

294
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:54,350
attacker would write so let's see how
that worked out for those came here we

295
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,690
start off with me getting out

296
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:09,799
and I go to the side door first I tried
the door it's locked really getting

297
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:17,639
pissed about the new crowbar commitment
to this contract but the good part is a

298
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:20,860
good to walk to the front door which as
long as part of the Stone Age and I get

299
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:33,490
to watch that will be taken online now
my stomach is so roiling right now you

300
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:38,399
guys up front a really gonna regret this
possibly so my apologies I Gallagher

301
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,840
show you know you never know so that
brought the bags and bags so I get up to

302
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,820
the front door

303
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,039
crap I'm still not there yet said that
was a long as part of the soldier can

304
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,279
talk I'm on a wrist watch video recorder
when I was doing this that's why it

305
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,740
looks like any Dramamine I try to open
the door it's locked I take out my

306
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:06,059
hacking tool 1018 phone and I stand in
front of the place like I'm on the phone

307
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:10,059
doing important things as I played Angry
Birds Eye way to 10 seconds it took 10

308
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:24,419
seconds and that's all I actually
compromise dejo office building that had

309
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:30,419
secured floors on every floor through
the elevator lobby by just standing in

310
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:31,220
front of the phone

311
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,419
stemming from the door and looking like
I was on the call and I and this was

312
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,850
really bad because on that one and stuff
you know it wasn't my phone it was our

313
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,100
country was not my phone so there were
no angry birds are video games or tweets

314
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,360
are things that I could do I just had a
fake it and then i'd walk in a walk out

315
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:56,669
behind the person or persons open the
door to get in I did every floor inside

316
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:02,929
at one point you're like oh i'm looking
here because they know the money is

317
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:03,410
important

318
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,900
they know that that's probably often so
I tried I mean they will go to the High

319
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,080
Tea for Kizashi degrees out there
they're gonna know something funny and

320
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:24,480
charming I'm in its ok go to the legal
team got we got a little hello guest

321
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,370
walk in the final of the CEO's office I
can ignore the CEO's office we're good

322
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:38,680
your good so this is the worst part is
one of the worst things I've had to deal

323
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:46,290
with engagement I got into the building
I was there for two hours in that lobby

324
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:51,240
area we all are totally underestimated
my EDD right now

325
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,610
ok I said I was there for two hours in
that lobby there is only so many Angry

326
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,630
Birds you can flip so many freakin
tweets you can Tweet in so many statuses

327
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,230
you can like in two hours before you
start to lose it

328
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:10,440
ok it was rough my battery was like a
two percent by the time his engagement

329
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,760
was over we are getting into critical
area territory here ok it was bad so I'm

330
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,460
there for two hours just like hating my
life and having a drink fountain water

331
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,470
which you know is not helping my
disposition at all but then I thought he

332
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:32,100
heard music to my ears a vacuum cleaner
it's like we're just really weird segue

333
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,990
but I heard the vacuum cleaner and that
was really good

334
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,890
he was on the second floor said screw it
was close enough as I can I went up and

335
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:47,630
talked to the cleaning lady now remember
I wasn't able to live so quick call to

336
00:30:47,630 --> 00:31:08,250
see what will show that I i didnt

337
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:46,090
and I didn't have my work

338
00:31:46,090 --> 00:32:46,960
clock it was a freebie boy I think that
lasts endearing don't judge me

339
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,360
car charger who was waiting for me to
fail and wondering why it was taking so

340
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:02,049
long from the federal No a key why i
like it so even though I wasn't talking

341
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:06,500
to him I would act like I was talking to
him it's like you always act like you're

342
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,460
on the phone with someone is trying to
do something for you and you're talking

343
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,200
to someone with authority because when
the person comes back like on the note

344
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,279
they got it could help me out with this
say they got here and then that gives

345
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:31,040
them the assurance that only he would
get in the way and I did

346
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:37,380
I want well okay I'm sorry okay I lied
once very and I said see you later and I

347
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:46,630
never saw ok but that was it I stayed
with the Ensco if you want an actual

348
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:52,370
threat of what an attacker's looks like
stop trying to put the scope so narrow

349
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:57,390
that I can get in with that kind of
scope imagine the guy got a bit less

350
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:01,720
morals a little bit you know more
incentive than you think about these

351
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,910
things and you see these things like
Jason's you're doing a bad guy if a guy

352
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:12,470
is willing to get a gun to rob you of a
hundred bucks it's like when you're

353
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:17,140
dealing with the state treasury that's
got millions and billions there is

354
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:25,410
incentive right to do bad things so you
should know that low this next one is

355
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:30,300
really this is one of more like are you
really mind this is why I'm really I'm

356
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,780
really getting away with this one I mean
I don't have shoes on its like you know

357
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,090
it's like a war it's like i'm saying I'm
doing this and like i mean there's

358
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:43,270
there's been times where I've
encountered people in the engagement and

359
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:49,710
they're giving me that look and i cant
im gonna really faces I like this either

360
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,910
wire you still letting me in

361
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:59,380
we both don't believe this I just came
up with it five minutes ago but it works

362
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:06,480
I mean I've literally broke into a bank
in the United States and I went with a

363
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,010
fake name I didn't even have an idea for
some great fake IDs the dog but it

364
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,560
wasn't even one of those I didn't have
any valid idea for the name that I gave

365
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,290
out with Colonel Jack Daniel's by
default and it's like and then I with a

366
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,380
company that didn't exist and with the
phone number that lord knows where it

367
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,530
went to the area code was correct

368
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:34,710
I don't know what I'm gonna do 555 first
just just to be funny but I actually

369
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:40,180
random numbers and I was loud through
the bank walking through the teller line

370
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,650
it's like going through getting the bank
manager to get out of their chairs like

371
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,590
a plug in a poem project stuff not
because I needed to but because it was

372
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,600
funny

373
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,700
ok it's like and it was all done with
fake IDs with it was just as always it

374
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:00,270
going but I signed I did what a normal
person was and I'm adorable so this is

375
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,450
one of these engagements this one I did
and this is a really cool because I

376
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,580
didn't have I don't have video for this
one or pictures which is sort of sad but

377
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,710
the guy who was actually on this
engagement study hard to go down there

378
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:17,120
is actually here so he can call me al
MPs and I refer to this engagement as

379
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,560
the Jason and the terrible horrible no
good very bad social engineering

380
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:27,050
engagement this morning I feel the worst
war I was in Kingston Jamaica doing this

381
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:33,040
engagement we do the first day was
pretty successful and they want to see

382
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,050
if we can go into the headquarters on
the last day and I'm like sure let's try

383
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,620
it now so we look at the thing and
they've got it for 25 that's really

384
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,580
secured part of town where don't like it
caught you know going over the roof or

385
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:52,860
anything so I spent an hour and 45
minutes googling for the sky is a deep

386
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:58,170
recon research for me people and a half
hour and 45 minutes you know DVD but I

387
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:03,890
found something that a charity
organization they had the same email

388
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:10,720
domain they were on the same network
they were in scope such as I'm going

389
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,940
after yes

390
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,280
are targeted the charity organization so
we have one of the guys call up to 70

391
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,530
hey we got this TV producers up you know
that's coming in can you do you have

392
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:32,020
some time for him and then they just had
dinner with us and we're trying to catch

393
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,319
6 a.m. tomorrow so I got to see you
today to make time for me today and

394
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:45,680
they're like I go and we go there and
get their fifteen minutes early and I go

395
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:53,760
to the headquarters here I saw this is
the wrong building it's across the

396
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,069
western kind of the restaurant amazing
how many times I had to go the Russian

397
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,319
agent

398
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:03,490
diet pepsi I drink is just I get lost so
many times I was in a research facility

399
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,349
for over two hours trying to find the
bathroom and I never did found a secure

400
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,760
server room and stuff but I never found
the bathroom

401
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,880
eluded me it's like it's funny how those
things work out so I go when I go to

402
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,099
ensure the security guy there any open
the door for me

403
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:24,810
walks be back there I mean I literally
thought he was going to go into the

404
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,170
stall with me ok this guy wasn't playing
around so I get into the bathroom and

405
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:36,730
I'm like oh crap to stand there like
what's the appropriate time of urination

406
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:43,500
and activation and I like you know I
gotta go to the scene and washing my

407
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,230
hands I don't think about hygiene
regimen that nothing happened and I walk

408
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:58,880
out as soon as I walk out and there's a
security guard he didn't do that but by

409
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,060
god that face was saying it's okay it
was implied ok with the stair they pay

410
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:09,569
him extra toilet that mean ok so I was
like ok I'm going this way so I go over

411
00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:17,170
there and I go and talk to the lady
she's a wonderful lady and the problem

412
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:23,069
with this whole thing is the pretext is
I'm visiting TV producer trying to show

413
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:27,130
corporations doing public good community
and I heard about how awesome they were

414
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:34,500
and so she talks to me she's a wonderful
lady as I can talk to you from from the

415
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,050
corporation's chairman the boards here

416
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,800

conversation shows how you know what I

417
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,550

hours you'll realize that already its

418
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,490
like let me know what I'm just to show
you this video that I have won the

419
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,619
previous TV shows that made let me plug
the USB Drive in forget about the rubber

420
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:02,700
ducky on it any plugin videos so I plug
it into his laptop and all of a sudden

421
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,339
he's weird messages start popping up
I've never seen before and literally

422
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:09,230
think that someone else's malware was
fighting with my mouth where they're

423
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:17,119
like this is my Moschino Moschino I was
your first I know julie gets mine is

424
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:24,569
like really bad and he goes he says will
let me call the desktop support the

425
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:28,730
video subpoena be no problem he really
wanted to see this video people

426
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:33,339
okay so he calls the desktop support
people and their part of this go down

427
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:41,839
like crap I can do no wrong and he hands
the USB Drive to the guy ok that's very

428
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,160
very you need to remember that because
it's not my fault

429
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,840
ok he did it ok

430
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,850
but I have to think wishing going say
hey I need to see where he plugs it in

431
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:57,130
because there's other folders and other
videos on there that have in da that he

432
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:02,650
can't go see a video to look at it deems
advisers no videos but there is a lot of

433
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,080
trouble so I got to see what computer
got infected so so I followed him to his

434
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:12,630
workbench and I see that he's running
Kubuntu Linux how much I go to this

435
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:17,700
thing for window so tiger told a good
sleep late and make the wonderful

436
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:32,060
discovery that does it rain and it's
like it I take it out and here comes to

437
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:37,350
worst part of it and I literally the
worst part of it I have to go back I've

438
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:42,730
successfully compromised these people
more than expected and it's like i'm for

439
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:49,020
the next 15 minutes I have to talk to
some wonderful genuinely carrying

440
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,960
humanitarian people and stuff you know
and explain to them how is gonna put

441
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,150
them on television this lady gave me one
of her books she's like literally the

442
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:02,930
mother teresa Jamaica I mean these are
wonderful caring people and I'm like

443
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:10,560
halfway through I was believing it ok I
was going to look like we're gonna have

444
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,800
one lady working in a cubicle stuff on
the computer and it will reduce reduce

445
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,330
up an apple or what that means is we're
going up and back out and we're going to

446
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:24,740
pan over the rest of the costs involved
computers working doing their job

447
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:34,660
gonna get to the class of the building
and there's this hungry girl and that

448
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:41,100
same girl it was working on the computer
and see how your work to do in your

449
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,990
corporation actually literally
translates to helping people out in your

450
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:52,290
community it's gonna do it

451
00:42:52,290 --> 00:43:00,300
so it was over to make my way out I get
out to the outside the building

452
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,100
typical scenario you how wait two
minutes so I go back n way two minutes

453
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:14,460
still standing out there has like about
three more minutes past about 5 the guy

454
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,050
who was driving a teenager who was
driving

455
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:24,620
comes over to be like going back inside

456
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,670
horrible

457
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:38,920
and I love the guidance of the Auditor
now so I can tell them that I'm not

458
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:46,880
gonna do it I don't know very well this
is not gonna be cool but I felt really

459
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,740
bad about it and tell you it's like
after I do a successful compromise

460
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:58,299
myself with ice cream I still had ice
cream but it tasted bitter just for the

461
00:43:58,299 --> 00:44:03,280
record it is a little bit I did feel
really bad about the officer you have

462
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,540
witnesses and stuff I was I was
commenting distaste for like two years I

463
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:20,510
feel bad so basically the summary years
we want to believe and inconvenient lie

464
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:27,430
it is better than the conven- boldface
truth that's facing you would rather

465
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,619
believe that a TV producer's coming
through and television than a bad guy

466
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:36,119
just came in and compromise my network
to steal money because we don't want to

467
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:43,200
think of the bad things do it I'm bout
to go fly on a plane and I'm like plain

468
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,299
lucky and die by you know over Boston
Julia finds ok so happy you know it just

469
00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:54,150
happens when those things right that's
not pleasant for a sad and I just went

470
00:44:54,150 --> 00:45:02,079
Jason things were having so good timing
and we did but we don't want to think

471
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,770
those things and we humans are all like
that so you have to start teaching your

472
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:12,819
users even though it sounds too good to
be true it's probably you know true that

473
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:16,569
really is a bad guy coming in to get you
it's like listen to what your little

474
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:18,130
voice says the back of your head

475
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:23,500
is usually right how do we do that I
call this my dessert and vegetables talk

476
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:28,930
because I can tell that was dessert here
comes the vegetables because we need to

477
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:33,750
do better and information security were
failing our users users aren't telling

478
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:42,829
us stories know what you gotta do what
you gotta educate we gotta learn to

479
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:49,299
educate our users and I mean areas of
education is we teach people this is

480
00:45:49,299 --> 00:45:54,990
James tellers at banks that these are
matches for those guys are adorable

481
00:45:54,990 --> 00:46:00,200
which he said those guys are ok but we
don't tell them to be worried about

482
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,589
these guys and these guys are told that
guy in the Apple App sorry but I mean

483
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:07,220
c'mon

484
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:12,079
Jackie you know he's up to no good why
we don't teach you about that reduced

485
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,380
start teaching our employees the common
dangers they face not at work but at

486
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,210
home we need to make them security
countered by default not by policy what

487
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:24,970
does that mean quite simply is and this
is gonna come to a shock to a lot of

488
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:30,789
business leaders employees don't care
about your data I know let that sink in

489
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:36,049
for second they don't they're never
going to care about your data they're

490
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:40,309
still getting pounded home and stuff you
know from Craiglist ad eBay scams

491
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:48,640
there's the millions and stuff was sort
of the same name is fine it's like you

492
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,849
know it's like they're still don't know
where their children are communicating

493
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:57,390
and who they're communicating with on
Facebook or Instagram or snapchat kicker

494
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:02,230
whatever whatever site said that out
there they don't know

495
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:09,470
so start teaching your employees how to
secure their stuff at home she somehow

496
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:15,130
to secure their wifi changed their wifi
access point name how to change the pass

497
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:20,250
phrase on their wifi show them how to do
the privacy settings for Facebook and

498
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:25,700
Instagram kid things show them how to
monitor their children's online behavior

499
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,140
show them how to be wary of different
schemes and guess what's going to happen

500
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,800
people are still not going to care about
your data but they're gonna be security

501
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,450
conscious they're gonna be going to work
doing the stuff in there gonna go oh

502
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,570
wait that's suspicious I'm not gonna
fall for that at home I'm not offered

503
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:47,350
here either I've been reports of someone
you also have to create teachable event

504
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:52,590
year-round not an exercise in futility
doesn't mean bringing up in tests are

505
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,020
ready for me to come in every year to do
this you can do that on your own you

506
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,400
gotta create teachable moment something
that shows and to know that there's

507
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,800
security out there and there's something
going on when the way that I do it it

508
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,910
when I go to conferences I use this is a
great educator and motivator

509
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:17,720
like I will speed up the pineapple see
what I can grab I don't have internet

510
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,369
connectivity to it it's like i don't try
to intercept anybody's traffic just if

511
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:26,090
you go to any website it comes up with a
white patients says this was not the

512
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:30,260
wifi access point you're looking for
hoops my bad when he faced with should

513
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,350
tell you the funny one is that last with
the very bottom was the one that I did

514
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:39,240
at aus Chamber of Commerce event in
washington D C you should really check

515
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:45,160
to see talking at the conference that
you're talking at because I did this

516
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,560
right before the conference started and
I was like wow look at all that the girl

517
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,430
whose name is awesome and then I hear
the announcer goes about to the first

518
00:48:54,430 --> 00:49:00,750
came on I'm like oh my gosh I got so
many this is great and then the second

519
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,759
speaker comes on the introduction and
here we have

520
00:49:03,759 --> 00:49:08,499
Mike Morrell Exorcist and deputy
director of the CIA and i'm looking like

521
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:23,449
crap crap and i'm looking at him like to
talk a little more awkward and every

522
00:49:23,449 --> 00:49:26,759
conference is not because I'm afraid of
I hunt pineapples goes I know he's def

523
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:32,679
not going to be here so I do other
things as well to be educational how

524
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:39,149
many conversations I have with people
today what kind of things we discuss and

525
00:49:39,149 --> 00:49:46,169
how much was recorded since I don't wear
glasses a gig hi-def video recorded

526
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:52,719
losses with the USB Drive attached so
that's a teachable moment for here I'm

527
00:49:52,719 --> 00:50:00,149
so glad I heard of it but that a
teachable moment not all your data is

528
00:50:00,149 --> 00:50:00,799
stolen

529
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:07,579
via computer not all your data stolen
from your work area it's like it's

530
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:11,699
things like that can also store your
data it's conversations you have here at

531
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:15,899
the bar what kind of things did you talk
about I promise you within a 30 minute

532
00:50:15,899 --> 00:50:19,519
conversation that we have at the bar I
will have everything i know if i dont

533
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,019
have your direct password I could have
everything I know for a password reset

534
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:29,339
its like and I can do that totally
disjointed not having to be in order to

535
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:33,079
not have to be totally random because i
dont have to remember it it's being

536
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:39,619
recorded the world we need to do we need
to start empowering our employees

537
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:43,209
that's when the biggest problems like
you think employees are a problem

538
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:47,649
they're not a problem the party solution
to the biggest IDS system that you have

539
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:52,099
it's like train them and work with them
on that it's like you got to give them

540
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:56,389
the empowerment to do it at like one of
the biggest things I can say in your

541
00:50:56,389 --> 00:51:01,329
corporation in your enterprise do you
have an extension that an employee can

542
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:06,109
call if they see something suspicious
email do they have an extension that

543
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:14,499
they know they can call to report it if
you don't why not that's not a key box

544
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:19,839
solution that's not something that
requires maintenance fees that's an

545
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,429
extension that you can get put into your
BB action 70 the give them a lifeline

546
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:29,829
out there to reach out to be a factor I
was in Amman Jordan breaking into a bank

547
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:34,039
the bank manager is telling me right
there don't like that USB Drive into

548
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:45,779
their computer and the whole time I'm
going to ride I should I shouldn't be

549
00:51:45,779 --> 00:52:13,049
here five times five times I plugged it
in the only reason why I got stopped and

550
00:52:13,049 --> 00:52:16,429
she got really adamant was good I was
trying to go behind the teller line

551
00:52:16,429 --> 00:52:20,529
according to the computer there's a
stack of money on the computer now look

552
00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:26,109
I'm not worried about the money I just
want a computer like money so that's why

553
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:30,130
do you need to make them be more
effective in give them a way to do that

554
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:36,380
and nothing was when you do enforcement
not just negative enforcement we gotta

555
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,899
we gotta give them positive force with
we just gotta give them away to show

556
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:44,819
that you're out there you mean business
and one that best things were that is

557
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:48,709
visibility sometimes all that's
necessary for enforcement let them steal

558
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:52,359
that information sir T this when I bars
outbreak or something goes wrong

559
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:57,880
go to the person's death can see it i
play first person shooters in my place

560
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,999
for shooters call of duty modern warfare
is coming out soon

561
00:53:01,999 --> 00:53:07,440
trees like already pre-ordered and I am
NOT one of those guys who goes and says

562
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,190
okay when the sniper on the roof link
and stuff you know I need my claim to

563
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,259
come over here on the route with the
heavy weapons fire set to go over to

564
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:19,769
sleep inside me know when I send me so
I'm not that guy I'm this guy you you

565
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:30,289
you know I'm his run and gun in his up
you know freeman leroy my team hates me

566
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:36,690
I usually get at least five kills to the
20 best even it out a little bit but

567
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:47,859
guess what happened cuz I get shot and I
refine and then what happens now imagine

568
00:53:47,859 --> 00:53:57,450
putting electrodes on me and every time
I get shot I get a thousand jolt jolt

569
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:09,420
how would my gameplay change pew pew pew
America

570
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:20,490
to change radically ride because there
are real world consequences to my online

571
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:25,720
action that's what information security
is gonna start doing show the physical

572
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,280
gratifications by a manifestation in the
real-life

573
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,589
oh my gosh they do exist I didn't say
security don't ask for anything so I

574
00:54:34,589 --> 00:54:40,339
gotta show them that so to sum it up
because I'm actually less than an hour

575
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:49,230
longer so this summer it up it's real
quick I hated the show I hated the

576
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:54,309
series I got sucked into watching
because he was referencing ended up

577
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:57,900
going to its I had on hand washing
halfway through as I can't wait for this

578
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:04,859
kind of guys are aware it was a bad show
this was a bad guy doing bad things

579
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:10,150
why do we like watching bad guys do bad
things and getting away with it it's

580
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:15,030
like we're good guys they should
suffered a should not be so happy so

581
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,970
when you're doing your job try to make
these guys a little bit less happy about

582
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:22,640
what they're doing that's what we should
be doing it so we should be rooting for

583
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:31,390
him we should be reading from the fail
so far gone that here's the time we read

584
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,130
the site

585
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:52,240
yes negatively I've had people that have
been a little upset actually I was told

586
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,089
by the person in Jamaica that it was a
good thing I didn't go back in talk to

587
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:59,569
that guy because he was less than
thrilled with my and he wanted to

588
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:07,009
actually show his displeasure in a more
physical way of expression so I'm glad I

589
00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:11,150
didn't go back to you after all but one
is not the only one I usually think

590
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:20,309
people see it as as helping come in and
done some so much in the way of actually

591
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:24,019
fell a little bit worse others where
they've actually improved really getting

592
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:31,380
was good thing why he has to fight
everybody was like widely or negatively

593
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,390
early reaction to my question to my
responses to my results and stuff and

594
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:44,619
then the other one was actually answered
it never came back and I retested like

595
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:49,470
some i've seen that that done better and
others did not as good thank you guys

596
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:50,490
they were putting up with that
