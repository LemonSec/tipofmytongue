1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,990
thanks for coming out this amazing talk
as you'll notice jason is not up here

2
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,150
with me and he will not be appearing in
all seriousness he was recently the

3
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,980
hospital so these are all recovering so
he's very sad that he's not here but

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,700
I'll do my best to give this
presentation about him so I try not

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,670
blame him if it's awesome it's all me so
I actually this is our fourth year here

6
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:52,350
and real quickly was anyone here or have
you seen Deepak to be able last year

7
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:00,120
hands anyone cool well this message
which is apparently everyone recap that

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:09,010
little bit so who am I am currently the
CEO of a company called excesses and

9
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,470
that has kind of a cool story last year
when we are presenting here the video

10
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,840
that was recorded some people saw the
video and we will talk to them and then

11
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,450
basically as a result of that Nexus
forum so companies are formed that

12
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,369
during that is more on this story

13
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,790
Eusebio penetration testers last
researcher for hewlett-packard and

14
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:38,640
beyond that I used to work for electric
power station much other fun places not

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,520
really they are kind of suck your soul
way slowly but the different talk so

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,430
yeah this is actually kind of research
that has been going on for about three

17
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,340
years will go back to 2013 Jason I
started this video game company called

18
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,840
White was at studios and we were a
little bit naive to think that you can

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,810
make a video game on like $10,000 but we
try to anyway

20
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,849
and we were actually gonna make this
game is going to tackle is gonna be like

21
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,930
this isometric thing and we're going to
have this information security / cyber

22
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,140
punk feel to it but one day we were just
kind of thinking about the gaming

23
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,120
industry know the problem said it has
and what the problems that have really

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,099
has is cheating and online games and I'm
like wow that's something we should not

25
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,550
more than that like how would you go
about solving cheating and online video

26
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,930
games because as you start researching
this Dec the traditional method is

27
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,780
really signature-based of if you start
looking at the end user license

28
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,390
agreements that companies like Blizzard
and valve and after the Asian they all

29
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,620
have you sign they're basically allowed
to monitoring thing you do when your

30
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,730
computer so they are allowed to get your
tags that are open valve was called out

31
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,459
recently well as the 2014 for letting
your DNS cache like some pretty

32
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:09,160
impressive stuff that really people
don't know what they're doing and Gabe

33
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,510
replied on reddit he said look you guys
just gotta trust us okay we're not doing

34
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,100
the dishes with her gathering we're just
trying to stop cheaters that really

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,299
didn't cover that while people in the
security community but regardless I mean

36
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,510
this is still operating today so our
theory was back then

37
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,220
well what if you'd use machine learning
to look at

38
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,150
player behavior because at the most
basic element of what a cheater is

39
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,560
trying to do is just trying to give
himself an unfair advantage so we're

40
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,690
like well if we start looking at the
statistics that are with cheaters you

41
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,760
might be able to use my singing the
yellow jersey not seen so that was

42
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,420
basically they're operating theory on
that I go over real quickly find out

43
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,730
what the results order in the wide but
pretty good at doing it and it never

44
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,950
ends today so now I'm not so says basic
grammar time do the machine learning

45
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,829
platform so what that means is we're
trying to make it easier for people to

46
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:17,450
create applications with machine
learning

47
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,090
so the goal of this talk today is really
to get you all to start thinking more

48
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,420
about machine learning it is definitely
coming it is going very quickly there

49
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,940
are lots of new players in the market
every year

50
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,320
box of grandiose ideas how machine
learning is going to be this magical

51
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,480
silver bullet I'll tell you it is not a
silver bullet by any means it is very

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,410
very complicated and as we go through
the talk you'll see wider will never be

53
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,740
a product that just say we use machine
learning in now and be safe

54
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,380
so there is one slide on here that has
an appt on it but I promises very fun

55
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:02,740
math so real quick overview of the anti
cheat because I do think that translates

56
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,010
well to are trying to do with
information security whether it's

57
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,260
finding decongestion at-bats or anything
similar

58
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,410
what we did was we use on the supervisor
so all that really means is that you

59
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,250
have a dataset that contains information
that you're looking for so in our case

60
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,130
we had a dataset that had a bunch of
cheaters in it I think initially as a

61
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,560
hundred and twenty thousand records of
these dating sites look like and then we

62
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,930
won't rebound all these professional
players and we use those as our

63
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,580
legitimate players so there's some
issues with that approach but it was

64
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,500
honestly the best person you can have we
ended up having used like this team API

65
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,190
which has injection issues people could
just falsified data are all kinds of

66
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:57,000
hurdles in our schools that we had
overcome the end result was back down

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,040
the so in 2014 we're about 83 percent
after it with the machinery models that

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,850
we built an essentially what's on could
do this is a fully working proof of

69
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,160
concept we have his website up you go
there you type a nasty mighty and it

70
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,760
will basically tell you whether or not
we think they're cheating and has course

71
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,360
Oct with it so here's an example of
something that we suspected cheating

72
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,690
down below show all the metrics and we
thought were important we didn't think

73
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,190
are important and and here's Jason's
account so Jason does not she is

74
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:36,530
well that's also true but the machine
learning system said he also doesn't but

75
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,680
something really interesting happened at
about six months after he gave her talk

76
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,470
last year we posted on Reddit and lot of
people uploaded it made the front page

77
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:54,270
of the camera so I Global Offensive page
separate page and other monitoring and

78
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,500
we look at the cheaters and what they
did and one of the features that we use

79
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,070
in our models was after see if you're
using a cheat increase your accuracy

80
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,480
would assume that you're cheating at the
scene would go up and you would see that

81
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,580
and the data so that cheaters
honest-to-god they changed the sheets to

82
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,400
sell and they built an actor's Flyers so
you can actually tell the chief like how

83
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,770
accurate you want to be so that was
interesting

84
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:28,460
there are a couple of case studies about
it here are the links to them there's a

85
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,570
natural link to our site you can
download the full case study we go over

86
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,000
the entire process including the beach
engineering that we did and basically

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,690
how he got it from 82% up to 93% so we
had some pretty good and performance but

88
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,169
now moving onto campus after all the fun
stuff that really relates directly to

89
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:54,710
you guys I thought we would start off by
doing their bit of an experiment so is

90
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:00,060
anyone here on what I will call the blue
team or an incident response team razor

91
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,850
ok this is great so you people who just
raise your hand I have a question for

92
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:11,470
you have no idea what organization you
work but how many of you guys think that

93
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:19,419
you could attempt to breach in under an
hour so I do not see anything about

94
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:26,250
under twenty-four hours so I think we
have three people to raise our hands

95
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,810
were under twenty-four hour

96
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:39,390
under a week at think there's anyone not
under a week or so ago with everyone

97
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:48,130
here who is on a blue team as a response
says under Reid also there is also begun

98
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:54,860
here in a second so everyone here said
honoree but it's really interesting to

99
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,529
because we keep hearing about all the
data breaches and when I was at HPI work

100
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:05,330
a little bit with their the ISE una what
was there isn't a response unit and more

101
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,460
times than not we would see breaches at
a place like two hundred-plus days ago

102
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,089
and then they just now discovered it so
long time from the first incident but

103
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,050
the percentage tater of the compromise
to when they actually tested it long

104
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:24,980
time and I think we kind of calmly here
in the industry is well you know we get

105
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,720
breach a lot because it's the users
right like the users have weak passwords

106
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,480
used good silly website users are just
now that there are problems there are

107
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,030
far north side right and i no previous
company one of the big initiatives was

108
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,680
well we need to make the users on our
team right like we need to harness them

109
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,260
and they need a hella stuff on it
happens and it didn't work out that well

110
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,350
so you know we keep doing the security
train keep trying to make use as part of

111
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:05,790
our overall defense mechanism that's so
going back to what we just did and the

112
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:11,870
survey here was a run said only a week
so we did our own survey with a fun to

113
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,260
see IOC ISO levels are a bunch of
different companies everyone in our

114
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,230
survey had a budget of at least 20
million dollars ok so fairly large sized

115
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:27,620
companies and we asked them to questions
first question was when it comes to

116
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,220
prevention how well do you think your
organization be able to prevent an

117
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,900
attack and were broken down as far as
like it was a known attack how well do

118
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,420
you think they could prevent that I've
that it was an unknown attack me like 20

119
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,550
day and then what about social
engineering so these are kind of the

120
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:52,470
results only rated the star system so
they felt that they were you know really

121
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:58,730
good at detecting no attacks which is
over there are left must be pretty

122
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,740
common about that and then you can kind
of see the trend is no one really voted

123
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,980
under three stars but okay that's great
but nobody is happening so I don't

124
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,030
really think you know the reality of the
situation what they're saying might be a

125
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,040
little bit

126
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,480
the night after night so we ask about
the caption and this one was surprising

127
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,770
to us he said alright so how long do you
think it would take for your company to

128
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,310
realize that you've been breached and as
you can see all of everyone that we

129
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,540
talked to said under twenty-four hours
and 24 hours they thought they would

130
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,720
know they've introduced or not i mean
you can also see quite a few people

131
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,050
think even like a few hours it would
take them but I mean speaking from

132
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,610
personal terms people do not know when
they've been very much for weeks or

133
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:56,980
months at a high so why is there i mean
why why do we not know about the bridges

134
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,550
that are taking place in this really
plays a big part into a machine learning

135
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,940
fits into it is when you look at the
landscape the day

136
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,000
everything's very dynamic alright so you
have a dynamic business business

137
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,620
processes are changing people coming and
going

138
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,839
the attackers are also dynamic right i
mean the people who are attacking these

139
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,120
organizations he straight actors are not
doing the same thing here every year or

140
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,790
year they are evolving and the other a
problem to as the vendors I don't know

141
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,230
if anyone here went to RCA this year but
I think there's something like five

142
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,709
hundred vendors there at five hundred
different product offerings that

143
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:43,220
companies are implementing into their
environment so you at all that now

144
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,880
adding the talents right so no secret
information security has a huge issue in

145
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,279
a closet Allen the last

146
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:58,410
study I read it said something like for
every 12 jobs that are created only want

147
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,660
them go filled so you've got a point
rate we know that lots of work to be

148
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,839
done not enough people to do it so
here's a map slide level a pally have a

149
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,920
dynamic plans gave away too many vendors
basically this results in the giant

150
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:21,740
dumpster fire expressly at large
organization might just like how many

151
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,870
organizations I know that have liked to
3,000 employees anyone know how big the

152
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:35,069
security team is one or two people like
okay I'll dumpster fire that's a result

153
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:43,379
of that so i think thats the problem so
machine learning again this is where you

154
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,139
can start coming in and start using it
the first step there with machine

155
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,470
learning you have to think about your
organization I think about your data any

156
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:59,180
related to figure out what questions you
want to have answered for you so some

157
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,079
sample questions that I just threw up on
the slide you could start saying well I

158
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,870
have all these ideas IKS data I want to
use machine learning a lot about David

159
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,180
setin maybe I just wanna see anomalies
in the dataset right things at that

160
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,860
outside the norm they can do that
another kind of common example that I

161
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,180
was just looking at the other day was
malicious files specifically Java files

162
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,100
so what they were doing was you know
either malicious file or was anomalous

163
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,759
file and they have all these features
for the two and the using machine

164
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,899
learning to determine whether an Optus
binary file is malicious or not but the

165
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:43,959
bottom line here is if organizations
have a tool to use machine learning

166
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:50,139
themselves you start to not really care
that much about scalability and why

167
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,649
that's important is when you look at
vendors and he looked their products

168
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,439
they have to consider scalability
because scalability is how to make money

169
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:02,339
and Candice how quiet so scalability
usually results

170
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:09,160
and more false positives more false
negatives so take away here is your

171
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,899
environment very specific it's very
unique like I said at the beginning I

172
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,649
used to work for HP a usurper magnetic
power too big for some 500 companies

173
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,720
completely different in every way

174
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,559
having a model that you build in try to
put in place a teepee let me try to put

175
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:36,029
in place a HP it's just not gonna be 30
after this I can be very good so when we

176
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:44,129
think about traffic flow this is there's
basically three types are very high

177
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:49,029
level of traffic that go in and out of
your organization right traffic that

178
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,639
goes outside to inside inside outside
where you can have people talking to

179
00:15:53,639 --> 00:16:00,379
each other like that's basically it at a
high level so if you have logging and

180
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:05,410
place where you will be able to do is
start thinking about it

181
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,679
well everything is communicating over
different parts right so if you want to

182
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,439
find a nominal easy and data said you're
probably want to do it by four levels so

183
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:22,730
if we think alike forty you had all this
traffic reporter ed you make a model for

184
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:28,829
forty and then you would find a nominee
for a specific port now you could do it

185
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:32,920
on the matter level which is essentially
what we did with oriented she'd we just

186
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,829
threw cheaters and on Jeter had we had
more data in wartime what we have done

187
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:43,829
is made a model for everything on map at
that game plays when we had a model for

188
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:49,610
different skill levels except and this
all translates again so you could do

189
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,800
about poor know what you could do it by
User Group there's lots of different

190
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,029
options you have when it comes to model
creation will spend more time on this in

191
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,749
a second but you really have to think
about the question you want answered

192
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:07,730
right I give its define anomalies what
kind of anomalies are you trying to find

193
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,049
trying to find behavior anomalies a
little bit different than trying to find

194
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,070
like file anomalies right so two
different

195
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:22,750
things as both anomalies with the
completely different so as you might

196
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,510
guess if you're looking at all these log
data and all this crap that's coming in

197
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,160
and out of your network

198
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,380
well that's going to be a lot of data
right clicking terabytes of data and

199
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,700
this is where typically people start
talking about things like I do all the

200
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,780
news equal stuff so just for quickly I
want to go over 100 really is so could

201
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,380
do is a ecosystem right has all these
different things that I can do this

202
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:59,460
diagram kinda highlights right nicely
like what does this is HDB which is a

203
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,250
flavorful do pretty well you go out and
download this today they have a spam

204
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,690
bots version right hand a virtual
machine and gets are playing with it so

205
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,560
all these things and I don't know how
are you can see it but here's the plan

206
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,940
the common tools if you will say hi and
each piece and all these other things

207
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,980
they all do different things

208
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,340
balloon is important

209
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:28,290
bloom is really one of the ways as cost
up to kind of get log data into how to

210
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:35,460
live in architecture slide go over how
this all works and is anyone here

211
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:47,460
familiar with openside ok are you guys
using it you are you like it but you

212
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:56,790
know how long have you guys to set it up
so if you ever gotten the openside the

213
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,530
documentation is pretty cares and it's
not an easy thing to get set up and

214
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,740
running it already in Java that's
another problem our personal experience

215
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,810
with that has been that is not very
stable either so that's our own personal

216
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:18,480
experiences with it but

217
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,429
so parking lot of Africa which we've
been talking about the basic workflow is

218
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,840
you would have a peek a boo some form
and he would take the pcap and if you

219
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,360
just want to start doing basic machine
learning what that you needed to

220
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,020
transform that P cap into a CSV file

221
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,640
R and R but what does go it's easy for
now and then there are calls out there

222
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,580
like weapon and lots of other things
were you could just start doing machine

223
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:50,390
learning on that and finding answers to
your questions so let's say that you

224
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,179
start gathering all this be capped data
now you transformed into a serious knee

225
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,540
earlier I said there's a relief well
there's a couple players a machine

226
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:07,570
ninety two big ones are clapper also
have two different layers of machine

227
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:17,500
learning right you either have sorry
brain fart basically you have one flavor

228
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,919
eat a train data to test data that's
called supervised learning and

229
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,309
unsupervised learning where you do not
have the answer right so in this case

230
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,690
theodore pcap files you're probably not
going to know there's malicious data in

231
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,700
your pee caps maybe you do maybe down
but more likely than not you're not

232
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,010
gonna know it's just going to be data
that you have in your environment so if

233
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,620
you don't know the answer and again the
answer in this scenario would be whether

234
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,030
or not the traffic is militias you would
have to use an unsupervised method of

235
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:58,290
machine learning because you don't have
the answer so if we

236
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:04,820
from the pcap to CSV example there's one
little problem with that and that's why

237
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,640
you're not into reaching the data at all
and what I mean by that is if you just

238
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:17,250
use plain all the pcap you're not gonna
have things like who is information and

239
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,730
all the other stuff that you might want
to enrich it with your not gonna you

240
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,270
know might be importing feature wise to
know that this IP address come from

241
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,630
China right might be important to the
customer if you just look in a final P

242
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,820
campus I'll tell you that information
about doing some for over in Richmond so

243
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,850
here's the open sock kind of
infrastructure you will and what this is

244
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:50,140
showing you can take your taps basically
person then the pcap that goes in the

245
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,670
car

246
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:56,790
it does all this in Richmond at the
store level and basically doesn't let up

247
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:03,300
today and open sock is also one of the
big reasons that we decided to do our

248
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,890
current machine learning project if you
look at the original architecture for

249
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:15,910
open so you'll see this big open soccer
game pal part of the workflow so sysco

250
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:21,960
decided to rip out machining part when
they release open saw basically because

251
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,160
they said that it was proprietary was
super important to Cisco's overall

252
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,680
long-term plans they could releases part
of the open source project which is

253
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,350
really unfortunate because I mean the
analytics be set up

254
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:40,000
does today it's great and all but it's
kind of missing the whole machine

255
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,970
learning right so analytics are great

256
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,420
lot of places are you doing that today
but the machine running partner look at

257
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,860
those analytics even look at the data
and then it would say okay here's my

258
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,930
decision on it right now we're tu sabes
that there's a resource issue in the

259
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,320
information security community so those
resources UW's you don't have people

260
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,980
able to sit there and look at every
single day which means you're gonna miss

261
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,600
thing

262
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,100
which means that if you have a model
that strain correctly you just have a

263
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,150
model sit there and look at this data
and then it can spread out and say hey

264
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:22,580
incident response team out of these
50,000 packets that I saw over the last

265
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,309
hour these are the seven that are
anomalous to your specific environment

266
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:34,600
so not you know that that helps narrow
down the incident response genes job or

267
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,010
the people whose job it is to sit there
and look at all these logs and say okay

268
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:44,409
great I am focus on these 7 things and
then the beauty is as you actually start

269
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:49,990
investigating these anomalies you should
go back and tell the system ok just was

270
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,130
a real attacker this was not a real
attacker right and then it will learn

271
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,419
from that so that's where the learning
part of machinery and is that as you

272
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:07,049
tell it more and more it gets better
over time so on that topic of getting

273
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:11,690
better over time there's this notion
that feature engineering when it comes

274
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,650
to data are basically what this is
saying is you need to look at your data

275
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:21,470
he'd understand what's right like what
you have in your data so if you just

276
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,500
have peaked cap information that's great
what's inside the pcap information right

277
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,909
i mean are we looking at a bunch of port
443 traffic is encrypted as an

278
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:35,210
unencrypted what does your organization
do are you a health care provider all

279
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:40,740
this is super important that a few kind
of look at your daily except the

280
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,770
features and then your next question
would be what what what else do I need

281
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:52,150
to really make this right I mean how do
I take my peak after a hundred take what

282
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,450
I have and enriching it with geolocation
information or who is information

283
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,440
hannibal we're talking about earlier you
would want to add this IP address

284
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,530
concert China Russia and then you take
that data you make your model and then

285
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:13,440
you think of the picture importance
chart and a lot of different our them

286
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,510
support doing this but basically what
they're saying is out of all your

287
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,490
features here is what are actually
import

288
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:25,309
into making a decision so and are and
light sheet example we had a hundred and

289
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:29,750
forty features only started when did our
feature selection we narrowed down to

290
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:35,690
these five different features and this
is how we eventually end up giving from

291
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:40,980
83% not proceed down or up to 93% is you
just throw out the things that don't

292
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:48,950
really matter though again like dinner
azeri talk about this as a whole bunch

293
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,700
of things that you can do to make your
data better we've talked about

294
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:58,380
geolocation who is information if you're
using open stock they do this for you

295
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:04,370
already did they will also do certain
things of that nature but really what it

296
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,559
comes down to is you have to know your
own environment to know how you need in

297
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,850
richer indeed this is not something that
most people can just come to you and say

298
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,620
hey here's how you can make it better

299
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:22,210
hint you along the way to make a better
but you know health care providers must

300
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:30,330
different than a power company birds out
so once you have your data has been

301
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:36,240
enraged and now you're actually finally
ready to actually do machine learning so

302
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,860
there's a couple of learning styles if
you will the supervised and unsupervised

303
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,850
and again this is means whether not you
have the answer so unsupervised really

304
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:51,910
good a clustering and doing anomaly
detection so what that means is if you

305
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:58,530
have it here so here's an example of
anomaly detection

306
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:03,730
this is a machine learning algorithm and
what they do is they have a state again

307
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,550
we don't know the answer is feeding into
it and the white circles are the

308
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:15,190
training set right so this week we gave
them all to learn from the green circles

309
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:21,160
are new observations that we are gonna
find normal regular and then the Reds

310
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:28,390
are the abnormal observations so you can
see like a little red line around there

311
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,450
around these two clusters

312
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:36,770
anything that outside of the red line is
considered usually an anomaly so a

313
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:41,320
better example drilling down into that a
specific dollar than that does is called

314
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,390
one-class support vector machines so in
this example we have apples with a

315
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,430
different fruits right but we're looking
in Apple's our players so it can even be

316
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,200
an apple or it can be a better but what
do you do with the Apple logo right

317
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,540
because that looks like an apple but in
reality the machine learning system will

318
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:06,340
tell you ok with the Apple logo is an
anomaly because it's not a lot of

319
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,290
different to it so that's kind of an
example

320
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:19,780
real-life anomaly detection and work so
some other machine learning algorithms

321
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,760
lot of people when you get started

322
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,050
will use the system decision trees when
we did our anti cheat we use a boost the

323
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,490
decision tree to decide whether or not
someone cheating basically all the

324
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,170
decision tree does is it makes a bunch
of yes or no decisions

325
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:43,590
there's a lot of talk about artificial
neural networks and deeper learning and

326
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:48,420
how we're really trying to get more and
more to like a human brain if you well

327
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:53,840
thinking or cognitive computing we're
kinda probably at least three to four

328
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,760
years off before we have a true human
functioning type of machine learning

329
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:05,460
model thing is pretty close but Watson
has a lot of limitations and IBM will

330
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:11,520
tell you that and then support vector
machines are probably your next thing

331
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,250
that if you want to start getting using
machine nine today was hurt with seven

332
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,540
trees and you get a better machines
advice would be my personal

333
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:26,600
recommendation so a really good example
decision trees was the Microsoft Kinect

334
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,310
project so if you're familiar with
Konecki know you can use hand gestures

335
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:38,260
and you can use movements and you can
basically do different actions by moving

336
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,860
your hands are playing games whatever so
in order for them to train their system

337
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,890
body parts look like they decide to use
a decision tree so they use three

338
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,480
different trains I had over I think like
a million images and the end result was

339
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,590
over a day of testing this model here he
would who successfully identify what a

340
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,650
human arm look like what human finger
look like and they have the system up

341
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,510
and running the traditional culture
depends on how to set them parental

342
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:16,900
thing out and taking forever so here are
some other resources for you guys to use

343
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:22,850
others the ideas datasets are commonly
referred you start reading some white

344
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:28,100
papers on machine learning Indian for
subspace refer to both of these are the

345
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:34,490
first ones the KDD $98.99 dataset this
is banning reached but these have

346
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,640
actually been original and I mean by
that is if you look at the data sets

347
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:44,480
they have the classification what that
idea is so it'll actually say if it's

348
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,049
like a buffer overflow it'll save its I
don't know just in maps gaining they

349
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:54,160
have her port scanning but they tell you
the answer right and that goes back to

350
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,440
the whole notion of Supervisors on
supervised you can use these in a

351
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,650
supervised machine learning algorithm
the other one is he had a cell KDD which

352
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:09,220
is just a more enhanced version some
people found on the issues with the KGB

353
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:21,620
99 and the NFL DDD was the result of
them finding out those issues so the

354
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:27,600
closing stuff I wonder talk about law
was the current market of machine

355
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,830
learning today so I recently went to
black at this year and I spent quite a

356
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,140
bit of time talking to all the vendors
over there and a lot of them were making

357
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,309
claims that they started to use machine
learning and the products and that's

358
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:46,410
what made him different than everyone
else so my question to a lot of those

359
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,700
vendors was ok well you guys using the
shining that's great I mean what kind of

360
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,140
our them are using

361
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:58,490
what kind of results are you seeing you
know how accurate are you and I kid you

362
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,170
not not one single vendor would answer
any of those questions often said no

363
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,620
this proprietary information we can
never tell you that you know that

364
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:10,800
secrets all sets you know looking under
the hood but the reality of the

365
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,800
situation is that it's not secret sauce
and that's how you would evaluate

366
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,570
whether or not the suffers working so I
can equate that to you when it got hit

367
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,650
by a car today without looking at the
car sticker of hey here's a mile per

368
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:30,950
gallon here's what the horsepower I mean
maybe you would buy the cartel seen that

369
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,840
information but again these are like
kind of the common metrics in that

370
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:41,930
industry said the ML sticker machine
learning sticker says you should be

371
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,420
asking things from vendors are making
these claims will what are your you know

372
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,120
what is the accuracy what does the
persecution of your models do you guys

373
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,020
have a rocker said that imagery there is
a ROC curve and more than that looks

374
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,800
like a upside down

375
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,860
letter L the better that is performing
so as you can I don't know if you can

376
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:11,410
see the colors are well but excellent is
yellow good as pain and pretty much

377
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:15,550
worthless is the purple I but again

378
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:20,540
vendors should be proud of this I mean
if you're really using machine learning

379
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,620
and its would actually make sure system
better than some of your competitors

380
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,550
they should be showing you that they
should say look at how great our product

381
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,550
is look at you know here's our accuracy
or sometimes if they don't show

382
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:40,260
rock-hard its ok ok with the mean
absolute error is another common metric

383
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,580
but after you get a report for us
questions next questions that you should

384
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:51,140
ask revolve around scalability so
machine has been kinda gained popularity

385
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,390
in the supply chain and what I've been
talking people in that industry is will

386
00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:00,200
you know ask them if you add a new store
can you just drop it and there something

387
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,840
and if you've got a new department

388
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,780
or if you had a new firewall is their
system gonna be able to integrate with

389
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,800
new firewall right and I understand that
might be a hard question to answer

390
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,560
because they don't know where you're
going to do but they shouldn't say

391
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,110
things like welfare of an API that we
can access sure regions are pulling that

392
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:26,110
data and then the final thing I ask this
what about lupita so feature selection

393
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,770
is super important as your organization
grows and as you learn more and more

394
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,600
about your data you're gonna want to add
more features that make your models

395
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,020
better half

396
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,540
you know is that a hard process is that
something you just you know do if you

397
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:49,780
had a new idea or as I can be a whole
new development process so here are some

398
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,200
additional resources

399
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,850
weapons they open source projects Java
base you can download it today has a

400
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,270
whole bunch of different algorithms and
it you just load your dating to it and

401
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,300
even start messing around with it
there's a couple of additional data

402
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,050
center resources here

403
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,690
kandel he's a very popular machine
learning forum and bored you can go out

404
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,750
there that these competitions were
companies like wal-mart and caterpillar

405
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,870
put their data out there and they say
hey here's our problem here's the data

406
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:29,040
just use machine learning and figure out
how to do it and they score you based on

407
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,460
how your model performs and it answers
the question so you're kinda cool I mean

408
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,340
you're competing got so much of other
people and then the final down there is

409
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:43,700
about HTTP and I just can't imagine that
one because again you can go there you

410
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:49,790
can download a sandbox environment
that's virtual image you don't have to

411
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:54,090
allow the configuration just you know
I'm going and the specifically there is

412
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:59,780
about visualizing service data logs so I
thought that might be relevant to some

413
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,160
people

414
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,400
but really I think the main takeaway
with all the noise has been going around

415
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,660
with machine learning lately is this
evening is really at all right he's a

416
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:19,910
tool to help organizations start making
better data driven decisions in this is

417
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,400
banned initiative for a lot of c-level
executives is we need to get away from

418
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,790
making cuts base susan's we need to make
a decision based on the data is telling

419
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:34,190
us and machine learning is again just
one pool and the arsenal that people to

420
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:40,590
start using its never gonna be say that
it's probably never going to be in the

421
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,730
next 10 years something where you can
implement its gonna sit there and take

422
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,160
care of all your security problems it's
just it's just not going to do that

423
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,900
again it's something that you can use in
your processes today to help reduce the

424
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,830
word but just think that anyone is ever
going to create something and say well

425
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:04,720
we use machine learning so you're secure
that's not how I know I'm sorry to burst

426
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:15,550
the bubbles but so here's my contact
info about Jason's contact info up there

427
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,020
as well

428
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:24,700
Jason Ashley leaves our data science
team so I apologize for some of the lack

429
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:31,050
of depth if you will on certain topics
today but again he is not able to be

430
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,820
here so I won't open up to question
answers

431
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:41,809
anyone has any questions down the back

432
00:37:41,809 --> 00:38:39,789
right things that they're trying to do
is sequins action sequence jackson's

433
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:44,549
been something I we've been struggling
with ever since she has been invented so

434
00:38:44,549 --> 00:38:51,069
what they do is take training sets his
foot a sequential contact looks like and

435
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:55,229
the train the models in this saying
going forward

436
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:59,279
can you classify whether or not this is
a sequin just contact or if this is a

437
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:06,900
very legitimate use case I think as
we've all got to see more targeted

438
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,989
machine learning examples so trying to
say that this is gonna do emphasize that

439
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:16,979
sock gonna be the solution is going to
be very targeted stuff like we will

440
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:21,259
identify sequin junction with machine
learning or we will identify malicious

441
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:34,720
files binary file things like that

442
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:56,320
so for sure so yeah the real-time
suffice and park on but that's not

443
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,280
necessarily domain of machine learning
right that's an infrastructure problem

444
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,070
so park is an example of how they're
solving that issue

445
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:10,849
barcode do real-time data processing and
what city does process then yeah the

446
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:15,240
machine earnings are doing it to a
certain extent yeah it's about how fast

447
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,720
can machine and looked at data but the
real problem is from an infrastructure

448
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:44,200
sampling of how do you do real-time data
processing right and the other question

449
00:40:44,200 --> 00:41:01,339
right the way things are today you would
never just want to put machine learning

450
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:05,640
into place and say ok this thing
identifies it as sequestration shut down

451
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,609
the IP address right you still need to
have a human level of due diligence if

452
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:14,910
you will look at the results of the
machine learning system of spitting out

453
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:20,240
and then have them make a decision as to
whether or not they believe it so today

454
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,070
I think we're at the point with a
malware we can take it and we can look

455
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:29,829
at data sets and we can say ok you know
there's this anomaly over here in Dallas

456
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:35,200
want me to go investigate an anomaly in
C you know what this thing as and then

457
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,349
come back and tell us the results and
then go from there but today I don't

458
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:43,560
think that we are in or close to the
point of been like hey look we have the

459
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,210
solution is gonna find it

460
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:51,069
99.99% accurate if it says that its
malicious go ahead and shut down the IP

461
00:41:51,069 --> 00:42:01,180
address or not there yet

462
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:20,829
analyst I think that you could take
years worth of work and power reduce it

463
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:30,250
to a couple of weeks I mean it you know
sabine efficiency thing as well right

464
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,680
it's an interesting question the
censored it all depends of what your

465
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,800
honor's come back with bright so they
start if you build your model and i'm

466
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,410
looking at the anomalies in there
investigating those anomalies and

467
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:49,400
they're saying okay this is a real event
right and I might not be a factor but it

468
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,990
might just be like you know some
executed or program that I think you did

469
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,369
on the box and I was able to do that

470
00:42:55,369 --> 00:43:00,309
sure you know why that happen but as
they get more familiar with it as they

471
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:04,410
are reporting their results it just
feeds into the whole cycle of you

472
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:09,480
operate so as time goes on Yahoo more
and more work will get reduces don't

473
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,040
trust the results more more than model
gets better

474
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,460
everything would have an impact on
helping save time efficiency all that

475
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:32,040
stuff

476
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:49,630
so I think alright well I think like
today the honest use case for this is

477
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,560
you know I've been at these
organizations we don't have people look

478
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,810
at the data every day you don't look at
the data but maybe once a month because

479
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:01,290
they just their task with so much other
stuff no one has time to sit there and

480
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:05,320
look at this dashboard and say okay yeah
he was nice and ask for great things

481
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:12,530
read it's been ready for the last three
years who cares right like but that's

482
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,130
the reality of the situation I think
immediately if you start using machine

483
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,760
learning yeah it might not be super
after it but at least some things

484
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,790
looking at it right at least being at
the lowest level of due diligence

485
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:30,890
possible beyond nothing right so I think
that your analysis will start actually

486
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:35,800
appreciating ok this machine i think is
great because it's actually have a look

487
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,990
at all this sim date or whatever they do
you have and say you know introduced at

488
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:46,470
the 715 or 730 anomalies writing going
spend ten fifteen minutes and returned

489
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:51,300
it this is a real attacker not right so
I think that's kind of where we're at

490
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,440
today and then long-term yeah we'll be
at a point where we actually own detect

491
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:02,580
a breach in a matter of hours or baby
even you know better than 200 pastas are

492
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:10,080
occurring anyone out I don't bite
promise

493
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:17,350
thanks for coming in the sink to me talk
over the phone
