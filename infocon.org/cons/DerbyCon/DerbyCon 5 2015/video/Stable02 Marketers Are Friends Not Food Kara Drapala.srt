1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,790
well thank you guys for coming over here
to see marketers are friends not food

2
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,250
otherwise you may be in the wrong place

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,070
all right let's get started so quickly
just going to go through the agenda of a

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,710
lot to cover today so I might be going a
little fast but I'll definitely be

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,590
available for questions after it first
I'll start with about me and show the

6
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,739
important stuff there were gonna go into
and and all P ranked case study which is

7
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,440
going to take a look at how our research
team OpenDNS / Cisco worked with our

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:56,640
comms team to great success we're gonna
do click coms 101 reviews so you know

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,730
who you should be working with what to
look for what their jobs are you more

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:09,590
insight into what they do there and talk
about best practices to help us help you

11
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,890
that's that's the whole point of this
talk we just want to make your life

12
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,630
easier as hard as it is to believe we're
here for you and then how to not go

13
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,060
crazy while helping us help you just
some tips on getting along with your

14
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:31,590
marketing people so this is what we'd
like to avoid ideally about me my name

15
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:39,790
is Kara droplet social media specialist
at Open DNS / Cisco I've been with

16
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,520
OpenDNS for about two and a half years
mainly in charge of all their social

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,259
media outreach but I also write for the
blog and create some graphics and do all

18
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,869
kinds of odds and ends stuff that just
gets thrown into the Commons buckets you

19
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,469
can reach me at K drops on pretty much
any social network especially Twitter

20
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:12,040
some fun facts about me he deserves my
favorite food imma take a drummer if you

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,080
want more information on the

22
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,130
that I will talk your ear off and I also
recently started playing tabletop RPG

23
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:25,840
which is really fun actually in my life
is chaotic in case you were wondering I

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:34,480
saw some questioning ok so why this talk
why that little no circle in the bottom

25
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,990
these questions will be answered shortly
but mainly I designed this talk to help

26
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,220
you work better with your marketing and
communications teams so he'll

27
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,250
researchers engineers they have very
different processes and thought patterns

28
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,600
compared to marketers so hopefully we
can all come out of this understanding

29
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,209
each other a little bit better and we're
gonna her best practices and also talk

30
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,100
about some things that can sour their
relationship and make things just really

31
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,020
difficult both ends and ideally it will
take some of these things and just put

32
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,930
them into practice right away on Monday
if you're answering emails over the

33
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,780
weekend like I am even sooner so
hopefully that will be the case and

34
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,430
maybe we'll have some fun hopefully
that's what the circles for it says

35
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,420
welcome to the show but apparently this
family-friendly so I had sensor that

36
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:41,310
real quick ok so and I'll hearing some
of you may be familiar by in March one

37
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,370
of our researchers share my o'connor
released one of his threat detection

38
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,450
models which focuses on natural language
processing in order to detect phishing

39
00:03:53,450 --> 00:04:00,739
domains so basically what he did was
matchup words so like Target with

40
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:07,690
support for Java or things die people
may register as phishing sites and to

41
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,020
kind of make this malicious dictionary

42
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:18,300
area of the internet or malicious
language of the internet and I'm militia

43
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,200
nary

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:29,570
how we're hiring yeah so basically we
can figure out which means they're going

45
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:36,360
to be using before they actually use
them and so the people involved Jeremiah

46
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,470
counter the author of this Andrew hay

47
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,550
many of you probably know our
curmudgeonly Canadian is the director of

48
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,540
our security labs so he kind of handles
a lot of media outreach and things like

49
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,910
that and then on the communications diet
Stephen Lynch who is our PR manager as

50
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,220
well as Lynn Cox whose are vice
president of communications and get

51
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,900
better so here we go so quick

52
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:16,150
timeline of events what happens so the
first thing is Jeremiah wrote a blog and

53
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:22,670
OpenDNS our researchers are kind of on
monthly a bi-monthly a rotation where

54
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:27,790
they kind of go over their research
write up a quick blog we go through the

55
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,490
whole process of posting it to WordPress
which if you've ever use WordPress you

56
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:38,120
understand the process and then Andrew
at its those blogs he make sure all the

57
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,820
gamers cracked make sure everything
makes sense

58
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,830
make sure they're not just you know
chain of consciousness word bubbles

59
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:53,730
we've had this before it's interesting
so he kind of said hey comes team you

60
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,340
know this blog is something special is
newsworthy which is a very important

61
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,460
thing will talk about later but he can
raise the flag on now and said hey you

62
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,150
guys should take a closer look at that
and we did and we decided like hey this

63
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,610
is a really interesting threat detection
model we've never seen something like

64
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,300
this before other people may be
interested so then we held several

65
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,000
meetings you kind of determine how we
are gonna packaged so one of the things

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,550
will get to later is that you can't just
say here's the thing go when you're

67
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,210
dealing with media they need a story
they need a message they need a package

68
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:39,900
you put it together and tie a bow on top
and say he's our gift to you so we had

69
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,680
to do several strategy meetings is
fairly complex it's you know free down

70
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,460
the rabbit hole in terms of you know
using our product and so we wanted to

71
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,570
make sure we understood everything we
also need to get contacts because

72
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,240
another thing we're gonna talk about it
is that when you make these packages you

73
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,180
need to put the research in context of a
bigger story it's not always going to be

74
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,470
enough to just say here's this algorithm
I wrote so we talked to senior members

75
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,780
of the team on this case the image you
and hear us more contacts so we can

76
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:23,660
frame it as a larger fishing story and
so we started pitching it takes awhile

77
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,120
couple days to a couple weeks depending
on whether or not people are interested

78
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,039
in your story and the blog actually was
picked up by numerous outlets are as

79
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,870
technical threat posed by was pretty
awesome and Jeremiah now world-famous

80
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:49,080
and fishing is not actually what
happened exactly world-famous and

81
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,229
fishing is still a little bit of a thing
so we're working on it though so what

82
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:59,350
happened here for a research perspective
if every kind of take a look so the good

83
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,200
things

84
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:23,330
Jeremiah is an opportunity it to do
timely research . I'm not even doing

85
00:08:23,330 --> 00:09:06,050
it's it's freaking out you guys don't
know I thought it was pretty good but ok

86
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,899
well let's see how r do without my
slides are a this is getting real you

87
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:17,560
guys ok so the good things he sees the
research opportunity to do something

88
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,630
interesting and timely that people would
find interesting and you know he's still

89
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,300
working on an odd pairing he got such
great response from it that he's able to

90
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,120
you know put it into production keep
working on it keep getting resources

91
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,540
directed towards it which doesn't always
happen with research that people do that

92
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:45,519
kind of really down in the weeds so
that's pretty cool he said that you know

93
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:54,250
that my slides ok though he he took it
from a research perspective into you

94
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,860
know something that the media could
consume which is a really interesting

95
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,709
process for a researcher to you through
its totally different from you know

96
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:06,470
communicating with another researcher
which everyone should experience at

97
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,209
least once so some of the not so great
things he had to let go a little bit of

98
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:16,680
control when you know you have
researched your baby it can be a little

99
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,070
difficult to handed over to a PR person
and say all right

100
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:26,070
make the changes you need to make to get
this out into the world and his case it

101
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:32,640
was the naming of it and I'll hearing
used to be called percival so

102
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,080
kind of a weird origin story there they
wanted everything to be named after an

103
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,650
eight round table for some reason so we
changed it and I'll hearing a little bit

104
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:49,510
more digestible and the bad things were
that he ended up doing so much marketing

105
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:56,000
and log work that it took away from
development time which can be really

106
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,170
irritating and not you know something
they want to do and we also made him do

107
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:08,040
a video which according to him was the
worst experience of his life so I don't

108
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:17,840
think we love you know that's me away
from my perspective we worked with the

109
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,830
research team and it was successful so
they follow the process which you can be

110
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,050
a challenge to get them to do that
especially when you know it's it's a

111
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,020
marketing thing we need to look it over
for edits and we need to make sure you

112
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,470
know reporters understanding that's
boring and they don't work on that but

113
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,040
it needs to happen so the president
actually work this time it was really

114
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,770
successful and they saw that it was
successful which is really important in

115
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,470
terms of positive reinforcement

116
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:56,360
going ok ok

117
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:07,390
right well I get to see this I okay so
what else happened the bad things for us

118
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,640
was that it kind of interrupted our
content schedule so you know when you're

119
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,980
in communications you plan out months
ahead of time what's going on and when

120
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,050
something like this drops in your lock
pop it takes a couple weeks to kind of

121
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,170
pick up your schedule again and you have
to add this in and you know comes as

122
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,330
always getting interrupted with Dustin
can be a little challenging when

123
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,260
something like this pops up in another
bad thing was that we had to work double

124
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,360
time to prove

125
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,060
to a research team that we were capable
of telling this story in a way that they

126
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,670
needed it to be told to not having that
trust is a little difficult and then

127
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,649
after the Trust was established making
sure the story was actually told that

128
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:56,570
way with all stakeholders is happy so
what happen

129
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,930
the results for that we actually
establish a working relationship they

130
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,040
saw the process worked and now they're
actually utilizing the process we get

131
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,360
things from the research team all the
time now which is great and totally

132
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,760
different from everything we had before
so that's pretty cool we got a lot of

133
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,100
coverage and you know for a company
that's trying to establish itself as

134
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,089
security player that's really invaluable
to be seen doing innovative research and

135
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:28,329
Jeremiah's profile also increase which
is great he is still doing talks on an

136
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:33,990
open hearing to this day so you he
really benefited as well from the whole

137
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:41,140
thing and some quick takeaway
communication is key it is the most

138
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,980
important thing you can walk away from
this talk knowing because if Andrew had

139
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,519
never flag that post never said hey I
think this is interesting I think it's

140
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,990
newsworthy we never would have heard
about it would have gone the blog

141
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,459
have tweeted about it three times and
it's a two way into obscurity to him by

142
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:05,790
raising his hand really set the whole
chain of events off although research

143
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,470
used to be impactful and needs to play
into a larger story and need to have

144
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:17,269
real-world value for people they are
going to understand it can be incredibly

145
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:23,269
innovative and interesting to you and
your buddies but once you put it onto

146
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,870
the world and needs a little bit more to
support it needs to be adjustable for

147
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:34,589
all audiences and another thing that
kind of glossed over Andrew did most of

148
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:37,190
the talking to the press when

149
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:44,040
we you know did these interviews because
there might not media trained and when

150
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,250
you have these opportunities just beat
reporters you need to hit all the park

151
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,650
the first time it needs to be perfect
because you don't waste their time and

152
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,360
if they're giving you a shot and you
blow it chances are they're not gonna

153
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,170
give you a shot next time so it's really
important to have someone who's polished

154
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,440
and knows exactly what they're talking
about

155
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,180
deal with reporters and reporters are
not researchers which were going to dive

156
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,180
into now so there's a lot of differences
and the reason you need someone who has

157
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,080
that polish is because they're not
similar juries are totally different

158
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,370
universes so they need things explained
in a way and they can understand they're

159
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,940
not in your company they're dealing with
multiple stories at a time and to be

160
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,700
honest you're not always going to deal
with a Steve Ragan or Brian Krebs I mean

161
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,750
these people might not know what a
botnet is dots dots the level we might

162
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:43,800
have to start with so having a go
between having you know a person or

163
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,690
someone who's dealing with the media can
really kind of ease that transition and

164
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,600
can tell your story

165
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:58,590
understand the press and another thing
about researcher reporters is what they

166
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,680
want to see some blood their
bloodthirsty

167
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,770
they want to see a hacked car they want
to see you jack pine ATM on stage they

168
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,900
need to see some something tangible
smoking gun a dead body and if your

169
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,170
research doesn't have that it even more
vital that it ties into a larger trend

170
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:25,910
story to give it and legs happen

171
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:35,980
ok so come no one who should you be
looking forward to do all these

172
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,860
wonderful things for you so people in
your organization who have

173
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,390
communications or public relations in
the title are probably going to be your

174
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,550
best bet to start off with although that
can vary depending on the size of your

175
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:54,690
company especially people if you're in a
business group or unit that focuses on

176
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,650
security and you have your own dedicated
marketing or communications team those

177
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,190
people are going to be the best to work
with you because there are ready and I

178
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,270
know they should already have you know
some technical understanding of what

179
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,589
you're talking about and hopefully it'll
be a little easier to get things off the

180
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,780
ground

181
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:20,829
screens not slashing ok he spoke too
soon

182
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:27,220
not going to touch it so the other thing
to be aware of his whether you're

183
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:33,970
working within within internal or
external team so your company may have

184
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,370
an agency that they work with as well as
an internal team with me just work with

185
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,310
an agency of the important thing there
is to remember to keep your corporate

186
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:48,040
person lived in with everything the
worst thing is a surprise that's the

187
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,610
last thing you can see me so I just
remember to make sure someone knows what

188
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,280
you're doing at all times

189
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:05,600
port to VGA adapter one please

190
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,919
free high five anyone with an adapter ok
so so you you found it your comments

191
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,950
person what exactly do they do come see
him multiple functions within your

192
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:27,210
organization they can do media outreach
they can do media planning so like I

193
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,669
said they they workout schedules several
months in advance they know it's coming

194
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:35,280
down the pipeline Nino at the overall
company marketing objectives are and

195
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,750
they're gonna make sure that when they
pictures stories the media it fits

196
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,470
within those marketing strategies so we
can keep going back to it again and

197
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,600
again and again and add additional
resources

198
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:56,140
things they can cover social media they
can cover media training which is really

199
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,400
nice if you want to become that
spokesperson for the company you know if

200
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,280
you want to get that polish

201
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,770
introduce you to friendly reporters
they'll do one-on-one training with you

202
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:10,990
are doing media training tomorrow and I
am the calorie check if you guys are

203
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,900
interested in that they're definitely
see how that goes

204
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,850
they also handle executive
communications so when your CEO right to

205
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,809
email chances are someone on the comp
team actually wrote that email and they

206
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:26,480
do

207
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,799
crisis comes as well so if something
happens you know if you present at a

208
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,330
conference and Samsung is coming down on
you litigious Lee because it's something

209
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,390
you said your lawyers in your comment
here gonna be there to protect you if

210
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,850
you know the press is calling you'll
have someone from public relations

211
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,340
sitting with you every time making sure
our reporters not overstepping their

212
00:19:49,340 --> 00:20:01,530
bounds in there keeping the interview on
track going to advance my own slide so

213
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,620
what can come do for you outside of
those things specifically as a

214
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:11,330
researcher or an engineer they can
translate for you so they can take .

215
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,320
super down in the weeds research that
you're doing and translate it to

216
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,940
you know a mainstream audience they can
also help you sell it internally as well

217
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,549
so easily anytime you need to put
presentation together or you need to

218
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,590
market yourself they can help you do
that

219
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:39,649
personal brand building is also
something they can help with as i said

220
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:47,240
media training so though the Eagles who
gave you that polish and then editing

221
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,269
which is always a contentious topic so
they can help you write blogs they can

222
00:20:53,269 --> 00:21:00,570
help you research reports white papers
and even I was tracks if you're

223
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,559
submitting to a conference you can send
it to your purity and say hey does this

224
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,230
make sense to this is appealing will
someone want to come and listen to the

225
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:45,809
stock hopefully they'll help you out
with that first second okay yeah so

226
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:46,889
quickly

227
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:51,679
ok helping us hope you proud

228
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,519
just going quickly through this again
communication is key I can't stress that

229
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,009
enough is the most important thing make
sure those lines are open

230
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:03,070
have your PR guy take you for a drink
after work or take you out to lunch

231
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,730
break worked on marketing budget they're
gonna be so happy you're actually

232
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,509
talking to them they won't care so you
know you utilize that even if it's a

233
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:17,379
weekly email it'll help them keep track
of stories that may be newsworthy ahead

234
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,529
of time and they can start working on
the message sooner so you'll have to

235
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:21,530
drop everything

236
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,580
do all these boring meeting also
understand that we're not the fun police

237
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,940
if your not your baby sitters were not a
censorship body if we had to take

238
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,560
something else or change something about
your research there's probably a bigger

239
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:41,260
reason it didn't align with company
goals are it was you know to out there

240
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,390
or use something happened this goes
through so many layers of approval it's

241
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,630
not like we're saying well you know
Jeremiah this is just we're striking it

242
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,310
were redlining it because you know we
don't like you that's not how you play

243
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,810
ball

244
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:02,330
be ready to explain how your work
affects a larger audience have that

245
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,630
context if you have an idea of the
context and we don't have to go hunt

246
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:12,740
down it'll save you a lot of time and
stress be ok with hearing know there was

247
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,120
sometimes we may say we're gonna have to
redline half of this and another time we

248
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,610
might say we just can't go with this at
all and again it's not personal I asked

249
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:28,170
her about this and its response was
killed the baby though you know your

250
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,450
research is your baby and you just need
to make sure you're ok with having

251
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:38,440
people change it and make it more
digestible for mainstream palette and

252
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,370
finally don't blow us off you noticed by
all outward appearances we're subject

253
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,350
matter experts as much as you are
subject matter experts so when it comes

254
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,920
to that you need me to trust that it's
our job to watch the news it's our job

255
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,520
to know what's going on and we can give
you the best message we can tell you the

256
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:05,090
best way to promote that idea to a
larger audience and then finally

257
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,900
committing for the long haul so this can
happen a lot if you're not used to

258
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,000
dealing with marketing or the media is
that you do one interview and you're

259
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,850
like well I'm done forever that's not
exactly the case we don't dictate when a

260
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,340
reporter called up and said hey I want a
quote for this story here sometimes

261
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,960
you're gonna have to do to interviews or
five interviews or 10 interviews and yes

262
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,280
there probably are going to be the same
boring question

263
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,650
but you need to be available because our
relationship with our reporter is

264
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,630
hinging on the fact that we promised
them you and your research if we don't

265
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,570
deliver it makes us look really bad and
our reporters probably not gonna come

266
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:52,490
back okay so getting help without
getting crazy this hopefully will help

267
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:58,140
you keep yours then patient I can't
stress this enough sometimes we're not

268
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,760
going to get a concept right away you
know live in the research as much as you

269
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,200
do so it can be a little difficult at
times you might have to employ the

270
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,090
explain it like I'm five model but you
know just stick with us we're gonna

271
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:17,880
stick with you just keep trying and
eventually we'll get it and attribution

272
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,580
is hard trust is also hard it's hard to
hand over you know six months work and

273
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,000
say okay I trust you to take this and
you know give it to the media give it a

274
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,180
shot but you need to kind of step back

275
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:42,440
kill the baby was it where and just you
know what do our thing and if your

276
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,310
costume is the worse because they're
really bad come people out there are you

277
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,780
have options so you can work with your
product management or product marketing

278
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,530
organization they also worked really
closely with the comms team and they

279
00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,160
generally have a little bit more of a
technical background so they might be a

280
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,170
little more understanding of your
research and how it affects the products

281
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:09,610
and can give it a better contextual stay
in so if you really can't stand your PR

282
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,410
guy tryer p.m.

283
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:18,640
be cool that its technical editor great
so we were not explaining something

284
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,840
accurately about your algorithm

285
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,100
program you wrote please let us know we
would much rather it get everything

286
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,419
right the first time but if it's it's
about the message I don't think you're

287
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:34,650
telling this story right we're in power
out for hours and hours coming up with

288
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:39,740
this message it is rock solid and we are
going with it so you're gonna kind of

289
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:48,340
have to call up hill and just let us do
our thing so there are some red flags to

290
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:54,919
you if you maybe aren't sure if you're
comes first here's how you can tell if

291
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,470
they don't ask questions after you
explain something to them

292
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,270
chances are they weren't listening to
you they think they know what they're

293
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,730
talking about and another red flag is if
they can't explain what you just

294
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,690
explained back to you in a more simple
yet accurate manner they didn't listen

295
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:18,870
to you all and here's some red flags on
the other side so quickly go through

296
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,250
this

297
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:25,110
how to get on that side of times acting
on your own you may know a reporter

298
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,960
really well like you may have personal
phone number but please don't call him

299
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,750
up and they got the next apt one report
let's do this you need to go through

300
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,929
your comes organization because there
may be some things and play that you're

301
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:45,429
not sure of getting the signs are gonna
go really quickly there I said it

302
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:49,120
not co-operating you're communicating

303
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,250
ditching interviews can't do that that's
almost the worst thing you can do

304
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,690
missing deadlines and not letting your
team know that's also really awful we

305
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,450
can work with you to try to make it
happen

306
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,700
taking things personally lashing out at
reporters are third parties and worried

307
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,289
about things you should be worrying
about let us handle our dog is very

308
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:14,610
stressful to we can do it if you're ever
nothing else communication is key

309
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,870
patience is a virtue you be prepared to
get edited and hear the word know it's

310
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,740
gonna happen remember that we're on your
side we're here for you to make you look

311
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,330
as good as you possibly can

312
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:31,640
and we're professionals it's our job to
do that so let us do it and also

313
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,990
reporters do not equal researchers so
don't think they operate on the same

314
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:42,529
level that is just bad news so that's
everything for me

315
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:48,429
here's my email K droplet cisco.com also
a key terms on twitter if you have any

316
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,909
